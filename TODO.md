# DONE

We either have URLs that can be easily scraped (https://schema.org/Event), or a file with enough details to recreate it.

# WIP

We have some data available or change notifications configured, but there needs to be more work to recreate the events.

- [ ] [ICTS](https://www.icts.res.in/current-and-upcoming-events)
- [ ] lu.ma (Uses G-CSE, since no public calendars)
- [ ] https://www.blrcreativecircus.com/events - Mostly on BMS
- [x] https://gameslab.wootick.com/ Covered via Insider, maybe add a filter
- [ ] [The White Box](https://thewhiteboxco.in/) - Run by same people as Trove, similar events.
      List of events is at https://thewhiteboxco.in/collections/events-of-the-month/products.json
- [x] [Bangalore Chess Club](https://bangalorechessclub.in/index.html#events_section)
- [ ] [Pedal In Tandem](https://www.pedalintandem.com/experiences)
- [x] eventbrite against known-hosts only. Currently used for PUMA

## Check Later
- [ ] https://gaianaturalproductsandservices.myinstamojo.com/category/419534/events. Courtyard Events, but seems unmaintained since they use Urbanaut

# TODO
- [ ] https://biker.highwaydelite.com/
- [ ] Switch HighApe to https://highape.com/bangalore/all-events which has enough JSON in a single URL
- [ ] Switch Trove to https://troveexperiences.com/collections/bangalore/products.json
- [ ] https://hooplaback-girl.myinstamojo.com/ (search for Workshop events)
- [ ] https://dialogues.space/events/
- [ ] bookmyshow plays
- [ ] http://1shanthiroad.com/category/events/ - Can't find a good source
- [ ] find more Townscript accounts to follow
- [ ] https://www.downtomeet.com/
- [ ] https://beruru.myinstamojo.com/
- [ ] Go through PS archives to see other venue hosts.
- [ ] [Indian Music Experience](https://indianmusicexperience.org/events/)
- [ ] [Parallel Cinema Club](https://www.theparallelcinema.club/events)
- [ ] [Maverick](https://www.maverickandfarmer.com/)
- [ ] https://www.meinbhikalakar.com/upcomingworkshops
- [ ] https://www.paintbar.in/collections/paint-bar-bangalore
- [ ] https://www.pedalintandem.com/experiences
- [ ] https://lockthebox.in/upcoming-events.php
- [ ] https://manjushreekhaitanfoundation.com/?post_type=tribe_events&eventDisplay=list
- [ ] https://sistersinsweat.in/events?city=4
- [ ] https://nd.jpf.go.jp/events/coming-events-announcements/
- [ ] [Dance Workshops from ARDS](https://www.ardsindia.co.in/studio-classes)
- [ ] [Claystation trainings](https://claystation.in/classes/)

## Known Issues

- [ ] Events with multiple dates are not handled well. Need to split them into separate events. Examples: 
	[1](https://allevents.in/bangalore/80004382397903), [2](https://insider.in/private-clay-dates-create-pottery-with-loved-ones-jun19-2023/event)

## Venues in BLR
- [ ] [IIHS](https://iihs.co.in/iihs-events/)
- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_Chitrakala_Parishath
- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venkatappa_Art_Gallery
- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi_Bhavan,_Bengaluru
- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Museum,_Bangalore
- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_Aerospace_Museum
- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Museum_Bangalore
- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempegowda_Museum
- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandesh_Museum_of_Communication

## Known Avoidances
- bookmetickets.com - doesn't host anything recent
- Eventbrite - pretty terrible events, not really worth adding

## Other Events

- [OSM](https://osmcal.org/?in=India) events would be nice to track, but separately.
