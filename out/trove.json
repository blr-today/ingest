    "description": "An ancient Japanese textile art form, Shibori embodies both craftsmanship and\ncreative expression. Rooted in centuries of tradition, Shibori is more than\njust a technique; it is a philosophy that embraces the beauty of imperfection\nand the harmony between nature and human touch. This makes each outcome raw\nand different from one another.\n\nThis experience is an appreciation of the art of slowing down, of modern-day\nsensibilities still being relevant through age-old techniques, and of finding\nbeauty and inspiration in all things that surround us.\n\n_**The experience includes trying your hand at 3 different Shibori techniques\nto create your own customised design on a piece of fabric, under the guidance\nof an expert.**_\n\n",
