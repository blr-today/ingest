Most of us are looking for ways to pause, filter out the superfluous noise and connect with our own selves better. For some people, who have a hard time articulating what they are feeling, self-expression through art and movement can be therapeutic.\nThe theme for this art and movement experience is \u2018Still and Still Moving\u2019: a movement &amp; writing based therapeutic exploration.\nIn this theme, participants will experience more self-awareness through movement explorations as well as some theatre-based activities. The experience will aim to build meaningful connections between the individual and the collective. It will also improve the individual\u2019s own connection with their sense of spatial, physical and emotional awareness.",
