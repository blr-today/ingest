    "description": "It all began thousands of years ago, when crushed grains mixed with water met\nfire and the first flatbreads were born. In ancient Egypt, an accidental\nfermentation led to fluffy loaves, turning bread into a staple of\ncivilization. From India\u2019s tandoor to Greek clay ovens, baking soon became an\nart form.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, bread fed both the masses and the elite, with hearty\nloaves for everyday people and soft, rich breads for royal feasts. The\nIndustrial Revolution brought machines, transforming bread into a global\nphenomenon.Today, bread is more than a food - it's culture on a plate. From\ntangy sourdough to chewy naan and crusty baguette, every bite tells a story of\nevolution, resilience, and creativity.\n\n_**Step into the world of breads and learn the art of making piadina\nsandwiches and hand-rolled bagels while exploring their rich histories.\nImmerse yourself in the cultural journey of bread in this experience.**_  \n\n_**Note: The experience includes only eggless options.**_\n\n",

    "description": "Tiramisu, meaning \"pick me up\" in Italian, was crafted to be as uplifting as\nits name suggests. Some myths trace it back to the 17th century, when a\nsimilar dessert called Duke\u2019s Soup was made for Grand Duke Cosimo III de\u2019\nMedici, but the tiramisu we know today took shape much later.\n\nOriginally more of a custard than a cake, tiramisu evolved into its signature\nlayered form, with espresso-soaked biscuits and creamy mascarpone. Over the\nyears, it has become a global favourite, loved for its rich yet airy texture\nand simple, no-bake process.\n\n_**Join our Tiramisu Making Experience and master the art of crafting this\nclassic Italian dessert from scratch.
