This makes\u00a0each outcome raw and different from one another.\nThis experience is an appreciation of the art of slowing down, of modern-day sensibilities\u00a0still being relevant through age-old techniques, and of finding beauty and inspiration in all things that surround us.\nThe experience includes\u00a0trying your hand at 3 different Shibori techniques to create your own customised design on a piece of fabric, under the guidance of an expert.",
