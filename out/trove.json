Most of us are looking for ways to pause, filter out the superfluous noise and connect with our own selves better. For some people, who have a hard time articulating what they are feeling, self-expression through art can be therapeutic.\nThe theme for this art and movement experience is \u2018HeART your Story': A visual art and drawing based therapeutic expression.\nIn this theme, participants will experience their inner worlds through visual prompts and creative &amp; meditative visualizations. It will involve gentle movement in one\u2019s own capacity and in connection with others. The aim is to get closer to one\u2019s deeper experience and give it expression through art-making. \u00a0",
