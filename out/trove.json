Rooted in centuries of tradition, Shibori is\u00a0more than just a technique; it is a philosophy that embraces the beauty of imperfection and the harmony between nature and human touch. This makes\u00a0each outcome raw and different from one another.\nThis experience is an appreciation of the art of slowing down, of modern-day sensibilities\u00a0still being relevant through age-old techniques, and of finding beauty and inspiration in all things that surround us.\nThe experience includes\u00a0trying your hand at 3 different Shibori techniques to create your own customised design on a piece of fabric, under the guidance of an expert.",
