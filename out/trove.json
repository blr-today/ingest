    "description": "Tiramisu, meaning \"pick me up\" in Italian, was crafted to be as uplifting as\nits name suggests. Some myths trace it back to the 17th century, when a\nsimilar dessert called Duke\u2019s Soup was made for Grand Duke Cosimo III de\u2019\nMedici, but the tiramisu we know today took shape much later.\n\nOriginally more of a custard than a cake, tiramisu evolved into its signature\nlayered form, with espresso-soaked biscuits and creamy mascarpone. Over the\nyears, it has become a global favourite, loved for its rich yet airy texture\nand simple, no-bake process.\n\n_**Join our Tiramisu Making Experience and master the art of crafting this\nclassic Italian dessert from scratch. Learn key techniques, from achieving the\nperfect mascarpone texture to balancing flavors, and assemble your tiramisu\nstep by step. Take home your handcrafted treat to enjoy and share.**_  \n\n_**Note: The experience includes egg/eggless options.**_\n\n",
