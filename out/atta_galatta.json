    "name": "World Thrift Day - Exploring Thrifting, Roots, and Circular Choices in Bengaluru",
    "description": "This\u00a0World Thrift Day\u00a0(30th October), Enviu is bringing together voices from across Bengaluru for a meaningful conversation on thrifting \u2014 what it means, how it\u2019s done, and why it matters in the journey toward circular fashion.\nHosted by Enviu, the event explores thrifting through diverse lenses. From a millennial who\u2019s been thrifting long before it was a trend, to a Gen Z voice who blends sustainability with style, and an entrepreneur working to make thrifting accessible and mainstream, this conversation will unpack how this growing culture connects to both individual choice and systemic change.\nAlongside insights and stories, the event will host a small thrift pop-up that encouraged participants to experience secondhand fashion firsthand. A space to share tried-and-tested thrifting practices, bust a few myths, and connect with others reimagining how we consume, reuse, and value clothes.\nThrough conversations like these, Enviu aims to highlight how everyday actions like choosing pre-loved can tie into broader efforts and build a circular future with platforms like Qilin.\u00a0\nEnviu as a part of\u00a0Saamuhika Shakti\u00a0is creates solution to reduce textile waste and build inclusive, sustainable livelihoods.",

    "description": "Step into the richly woven world of Bebey\u2019s Day Out by Lakshmi C.V, where stories move\nseamlessly across centuries, cities, and states of mind. From the bustling IT hubs of modern\nIndia to the quiet cotton fields of the seventeenth-century Deccan, Lakshmi crafts tales that\nexplore the fragile boundaries between the ordinary and the extraordinary, the real and the\nsupernatural. Each story opens a window into a different world \u2014 one filled with love, loss, guilt,\nand grace.\nPopulated with a memorable cast \u2014 from a spirited old lady to a weary housewife and a\nrestless teenager \u2014 this collection delves into the raw, unguarded emotions that make us\nhuman. Told with insight, warmth, and gentle humour, Bebey\u2019s Day Out is a celebration of life\u2019s\nunpredictability, reminding us that beneath every moment of chaos or calm lies a story waiting to\nbe told.\nAbout the author\nLakshmi C.V. is a writer who delightfully blurs the lines between being a storyteller and a\nhomemaker \u2014 though she\u2019s still deciding which came first. A Physics graduate from IIT with her\nhead often in the clouds but her feet firmly on the ground (also the name of her blog), Lakshmi\nbrings warmth, humour, and heart to everything she writes. Her journey as a writer began early,\nwith her first piece published in Eve\u2019s Weekly while she was still in school.\nHer stories have since appeared in Femina, Woman\u2019s Era, Good Housekeeping, Today,\nWomen\u2019s Web, and Readomania, among others. She has also written books for children and\ncontributed to anthologies like Airavata: Elephant Tales. When not lost in words, Lakshmi can be\nfound teaching, volunteering, or reading \u2014 always finding joy in the journey rather than the\ndestination.\nShe slips in and out of teaching mode without warning. It was quite a relief to her children when\nshe took up assignments as a volunteer with Teach India.\nWhen she is not writing, she is reading for herself, and editing other people\u2019s works.\nFor her, the journey is more interesting than the destination.\nShe lives in the NCR.",

    "description": "Author and activist Meera Vijayann will be in Bangalore this November for a special book signing event celebrating the release of her debut essay collection, Girls Who Said Nothing & Everything, published by Penguin Random House India. The event will take place on Thursday, 7th November at 3:30 PM at Atta Galatta, one of the city\u2019s most beloved indie bookstores.\nVijayann\u2019s collection features eleven deeply personal essays that explore the silences Indian women have been taught to maintain\u2014at home, in relationships, and within themselves. Set in 1990s India, the essays delve into themes of girlhood, family, bodily autonomy, and the emotional inheritance of silence. With candour and nuance, the book speaks to the resilience it takes to find and reclaim one\u2019s voice.\nBased in Washington, Meera Vijayann has written extensively on gender, mental health, and social justice, with bylines in The Guardian, Forbes, Catapult, and Electric Literature. Her widely viewed TED talk on experiencing sexual assault as a young girl in India continues to resonate with audiences around the world.\nThe event offers readers a rare opportunity to meet the author in person and engage with her work, which is already being recognised as a bold and timely contribution to feminist literature",

The \u2018kire\u2019 or \u2018cut\u2019, which is so important to haiku, will be taught. Certain key Japanese aesthetics will also be introduced. Homework will be assigned.\n16th November: Haiku assigned as homework will be discussed. The class progresses into an in-depth study of the masters, both old and new. A brief introduction to haibun (prose embedded with haiku), tanka (a 1300-year-old lyrical poem), and haiku (artwork with haiku) will be provided.",

    "description": "Join in for an interactive experiment-led science session by physics educator and writer Madhuri Katti and some of her students. The goal of the session is to show young students and adults a different and engaging way of thinking about science, history of scientific ideas and its effects on everyday life, by exploring fundamental topics via simple home-experiments. The experiments will be of three parts:\n- Fun with Forces: Explanation of the four fundamental forces of nature, and their effects. Demonstration of experiments with gravity and static electricity.\u00a0\n- Magnets and Motors : construction of a simple motor with a battery, magnet, and copper wire. Discussion of electricity and magnetism.\n- Playing with fluids: demonstrations of dynamics of fluids involving surface tension, and diffusion. Light along with Fluids.\nAt the end, we hope to inspire the participants to be boldly curious and to recognise the importance of science in our everyday lives.",

    "name": "The Stray Dogs of Landour Network: A True Story by a Failed Dog Trainer - Book Launch by Lalitha Krishnan",
    "description": "Lalitha Krishnan will introduce her new memoir in an interactive session. Released earlier this year, the book is available in both print and e-book formats on Amazon, Pothi.com, and Flipkart. It is a testament to the profound lessons of compassion, resilience, and belonging taught by free-ranging dogs.\nThe story begins in Landour, where Krishnan, a newly certified dog trainer fighting battles of her own, encounters a troubled stray named Pretty on her doorstep. With a training manual in hand, she intends to help Pretty find a home. But Pretty has a different plan, and with quiet intelligence, she leads Krishnan into her world, introducing her to her pup and the rest of the pack.\nInspired by the philosophy of Ubuntu (\u201cI am because we are\u201d), Krishnan finds herself feeding, training, and caring for a growing network of dogs in an international neighbourhood. In doing so, she begins to heal, learning that her canine companions have as much to teach her as she has to teach them. The dogs, with their innate wisdom and social dynamics, reshape Krishnan\u2019s understanding of love and survival.\nThe Stray Dogs of Landour Network: A True Story by a Failed Dog Trainer features a foreword by the late travel writer Bill Aitken, who also contributed a chapter titled \u201cMussoorie Dogs and Dog Lovers I Love.\u201d Krishnan recounts stories shared by authors Stephen Alter and Ganesh Saili, both residents of Landour. Her book is a tribute to the silent, unseen lives of the animals who share our world and the emotional truths they awaken within us.\nReview:\n\u201cThe Stray Dogs of Landour Network is a deeply personal, unflinchingly honest memoir that sits comfortably on the shelf alongside Helen Macdonald\u2019s H Is for Hawk or Sy Montgomery\u2019s The Soul of an Octopus. It is a story of survival, not just of dogs, but of people finding grace in the act of caring without conditions.\u00a0\nA poignant, slow-blooming debut that blends environmental awareness with emotional depth. Lalitha Krishnan\u2019s voice is one of rare integrity, grounded, observant, and quietly radical in its compassion.\u201d\n\u00a0\u2014 The Literature Today\nAbout the Author:\nLalitha Krishnan is a writer, podcaster, potter, and nature documenter based in Ranikhet in the Indian Himalaya. Her work explores the bonds between humans, animals, and the natural world. A certified dog trainer, Krishnan is passionate about dogs and wildlife and has contributed to publications including Dogs & Pups Magazine, Garhwal Post, RoundGlass Sustain, and Sanctuary Asia, among others.",
