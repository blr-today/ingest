Open to anyone aged 16 and above, no prior background in psychology is needed\u2014just an open mind and a curiosity to explore the deeper meaning of life.\nWorkshop Objectives:\n\u2022\u2060 \u2060To introduce participants to the core concepts of Logotherapy and Viktor Frankl\u2019s philosophy.\n\u2022\u2060 \u2060To provide practical techniques for finding and creating meaning in daily life.\n\u2022\u2060 \u2060To encourage introspection and group sharing that can lead to moments of personal clarity and insight\n\u2022\u2060 \u2060To create a safe, supportive space for meaningful discussions and individual growth.\nCommunity Guidelines:\n\u2022\u2060 \u2060Approach the workshop with openness, curiosity, and kindness.\n\u2022\u2060 \u2060Respect each participant\u2019s unique perspective and journey.\n\u2022\u2060 \u2060Engage in thoughtful, supportive, and constructive conversations.\nDO CARRY A NOTEBOOK AND A PEN\nWe aim to create a focused and intimate experience, allowing for personalized attention, deeper engagement, and meaningful reflection.",

    "name": "Woman and the Moon - Book Launch",
    "description": "The moon is worshipped as a living goddess across many cultures, be in Greek, Roman, Chinese, or Egyptian. In the Greco-Roman tradition, the moon is known by various names, such as Cynthia, Diana, and Selene, whereas Egyptians prayed to Isis as the moon goddess. Isis is also the mother of the ancient religion of Wicca, a philosophy Jagari was deeply influenced by, in the form in which it is practised in India. She was introduced to Wicca by poet Rajorshi Patranabis, a senior Wiccan whom she fondly calls Rajorshi Da. Subsequently, she attended classes taught by the Wiccan High Priestess, Ipsita Roy Chakraverti. She was drawn to this ideal, at the core of which lies the honoring of the feminine energy, or Shakti. Needless to add, she was smitten by the moon goddess.\nIn November 2023, Rajorshi Da tagged Jagari in a social media post challenging her to complete 10 poems in 10 days. The fates conspired and her first poem was titled \"Woman and the Moon.\" Once she started writing, she found that she could not stop. Hence, were born these 70 poems with the moon at the center. However, other than the woman and the moon, there is a third character\u2014the \"you\" or the (male) lover whom the woman addresses. These three characters come together in a symphony in each of the poems. The woman is the \u201cI\u201d of the poem, the man is the \u201cyou\u201d, and the moon is a omniscient presence. The tenor of every poem varies according to the lights and shadows of the woman's moods.\nAnd so, dear reader, we welcome you to enjoy the shimmering pageant of\u00a0 \"Woman and the Moon.\"",

    "name": "Women's Sound and Art Workshop - Wellness Workshop",
    "description": "Great things happen when women connect.\nSound is the source of this entire creation.\nDid you know that the sound of the musical notes have a profoundly positive impact on our chakras?\nWhether you receive the sounds from sacred singing bowls meant for the purpose of healing or well-being, or you sing the notes yourself, they bring in a sense of balance.\nAs this balance fosters feelings of joy and peace, it can aid creative expression in many forms.\nPainting is one such creative form that is closely associated with sound and music. The choice of colours, mood and theme, sensory and emotional experience while painting gets influenced by the presence of sound and music in the environment where art is taking place impacting the artistic process and the final creation.\nInspired by this, we have a similar collaboration with artists Shilpi, Ayuushi, Priyanka and Khusbu who aspire to hold a Sound & Art Workshop for women wishing to experience such intense joy and creativity on 8th March 2025, International Women\u2019s Day.\nIt would be a treat to observe the participants flow with the sounds and express their art.\nTake away:\nPainting to add vibrancy to your room or your living. An ideal gift that you can make, gift and surprise anyone.\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to receive encouragement from peer women.\nWhat to Bring:\n\nYoga mat.\nShawl / stole.\nDrinking water bottle.\n\nNo prior art experience is necessary.\nParticipants should come with an open mind. All other materials will be provided.\nWear comfortable, light color cotton / linen clothing as absorbing the vibrations is easier.\nRegistration: Spaces are limited, so early registration is encouraged.",
