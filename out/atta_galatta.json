    "description": "Experience the Exclusive Launch of The Colony Brats, a Coming-of-Age Comedy-Drama by Vineed P Menon!\nHi, I\u2019m Niv, though my parents named me Nivrutti Nandan Nedumpilly Nair\u2014yeah, I know, what a ridiculous name. But trust me, the name is nothing compared to the ridiculousness of my life. And here\u2019s why we call ourselves brats in Sawalpur, a town dominated by the cement plant:\n\nAs children of wage board workers, we faced injustice and weren\u2019t allowed to enter the officers\u2019 colony. But I had the guts to sneak into my girlfriend\u2019s quarters\u2014don\u2019t ask why.\nMy best friend, Baiju, had the audacity to have an affair\u2014sorry, a relationship\u2014with the colony\u2019s schoolteacher.\nOur so-called ordinary life was filled with mischief, adventures, and escapades.\nOur shift to an ultra-ordinary life came with reckless schemes and acts of revenge, making the lives of the factory officers, who took their privilege a bit too literally, a living hell\u2014just to prove our worth.\nMy problem? I take things to heart and always make sure to get back at those who hurt me. This time, it was the cement company that wronged me, and I made sure to give back royally.\n\nRead The Colony Brats to learn how not to screw up your life\u2014and everyone else's\u2014with vengeance. Get ready to laugh, cry, and rethink everything as you follow our journey from innocent kids to not-so-innocent troublemaking adults. Outrage can turn your world upside down, and our story is living proof of that.\nThe Invite\nHey there! Niv here. Curious about me, my best friend Baiju, and the chaotic world of our cement colony in Sawalpur? Join us at Atta Galatta on 30th November at 6:30 pm. Trust me\u2014you won\u2019t want to miss the laughs, the drama, and all the mayhem in between.\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: you\u2019ll meet the mastermind behind all this\u2014our storyteller and certified troublemaker, Vineed P. Menon! He\u2019s more than just a writer, let me tell you. He\u2019s written and directed over eight original plays, including That Night and Family Ke Side Effects, along with short films like First Sin, Interfere, and Ring Road that even made the Dadasaheb Phalke Awards take notice. Oh, and he\u2019s also the co-writer of the Assamese film Birangana Xaadhani (currently in post-production). And if that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019s also a seasoned Training Manager\u2014though I\u2019ve got a few \u201ctraining\u201d stories of my own he wouldn\u2019t dare share!\nSo, whether you're here for the stories, the laughs, or just to see what kind of madness unfolds, be there. You won\u2019t regret it\u2014well, at least not as much as the cement company regrets messing with me!",
