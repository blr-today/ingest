    "description": "Representation in literature is more than just visibility. It\u2019s about authenticity, dignity, and the power of stories to shape perspectives. This October, the AG Lit Sisters gather to explore how LGBTQ+ voices have been portrayed across genres, from tender romances and fierce memoirs to bold contemporary fiction.\nThrough discussion and reflection, we\u2019ll celebrate the importance of diverse narratives while questioning the stereotypes and silences that still exist in publishing. Together, we\u2019ll ask: When did literature first help you \u201csee\u201d LGBTQ+ representation? And what did it change in you?\nWhether you\u2019re a reader, writer, or ally, this is a safe space to sip coffee, exchange ideas, and celebrate the many hues of the human experience.\n\u2728 Come join us. Let\u2019s read beyond the rainbow.",

    "name": "Invisible Housemates-Book Signing - Book Signing by Deepa Padmanaban",
    "description": "Beyond and within the familiar confines of our home, a vibrant, bustling ecosystem thrives, often unnoticed, but always present. This book is an exploration of that hidden world, a journey into the lives of the animals, birds and insects that share our dwellings and the spaces immediately surrounding them. Some are beneficial, acting as natural pest control, while others can be perceived as nuisances, challenging our sense of control and cleanliness. Yet, they all contribute to the rich tapestry of life that surrounds us, each with wonderous stories of survival, adaptation, and interaction.\nThis book aims to illuminate these often-overlooked, invisible housemates, to bridge the gap between our human-centric perspective and the fascinating world they occupy. I delve into the natural history of 13 amazing creatures, exploring their behaviours, life cycles, and ecological roles. I examine the intricate relationships they have with each other and with us, the humans who share their space. How do our actions, our habits, and the very architecture of our homes influence their lives? How do they, in turn, impact our own? After reading this book, I hope that readers can develop a more appreciative eye for these marvellous creatures, even the ones that incite fear, gain a richer understanding of the natural world and our place within it.",

Assigned to a chaotic school once led by the mysteriously absent Salma Khatoon, Samiran's efforts to restore order only lead him deeper into unsettling events. From a water shortage to a snake in his room, his attempts to connect with the eccentric villagers only intensify his isolation. But behind it all, Samiran harbors a secret\u2014someone named Vrindaban. Why does he hide this figure? Is it the only refuge in a world that refuses to understand him? The play unravels questions about isolation, hidden truths, and the blurred lines between personal and professional life.\nAbout the artist:\u00a0 Somudranil Sarkar, a theatre maker from kolkata. He has over 25 years of experience in theatre and has had the privilege of training under some of the most respected names in the Bengali theatre circuit, including Rudraprasad Sengupta, Swatilekha Sengupta, Debshankar Halder, Sohini Sengupta, and Goutam Halder in Nandikar.
