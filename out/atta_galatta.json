Zealous messengers, art and music as mood enhancers, food as aphrodisiacs, taboos and mores \u2013 all play a pivotal role in shaping stories of love. Vikram Sridhar and Aparna Jaishankar rummage through the passages of time to bring you various hues of love etched in our heritage through literature, architecture, songs and poetry through the all- encompassing art form of oral storytelling.\nAbout Aparna Jaishankar\nAparna Jaishankar is a Storyteller with a penchant for Indic mythology. She believes that there is no ONE version of any story. Her storytelling performances take a contemporary view of ancient tales. Aparna also works with educators in developing learning perspectives in the classroom and with organisations in building internal narratives.\nAbout Vikram Sridhar \nVikram Sridhar is a Performance Storyteller and theatre practitioner who believes in Storytelling as a strong medium for Conservation and Conversation, which is highly relevant in the modern context. Vikram combines his work and interest in Theatre, Social Work, and Conservation in his Storytelling and has performed for audience of various age groups across India.",
