    "description": "People make up big cities but what makes up people\u2019s lives, hopefully not loneliness. Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk2 of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.\nThis support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.\nThe support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

    "name": "Mozhi: Foregrounding Indian Literature in Translation - Discussion",
    "description": "This session shall centre on The Mozhi Prize Anthology - I: A House Without Cats and Other Stories, published by SouthSide Books, a collection of diverse stories from Tamil that made it to the shortlist of the first edition of the inaugural edition of the Mozhi Prize. These are unusual stories -- a village deity's desperate attempts to salvage its position in the hierarchy of veneration, a woman's deep connection with the cotton she grows at great peril to her own self, a mad carpenter who cannot fix an ordinary ladder but carves a stunning figurine of his favourite gods, and more. The beauty of this collection lies not just in the stories themselves, but in how they reveal the rich diversity of Indian literature\u2014voices that transcend language boundaries, bringing readers into conversations about life, society, and the human experience.\nMozhi is an initiative that aims to bring together literatures from various Indian languages and provide a platform for critical discourse. One of Mozhi's flagship initiatives is the Mozhi Prize, a one-of-a-kind annual short fiction prize that recognises new and exciting talent in translation. While seeking to platform new translation talent, the Mozhi Prize also aspires to be a repository of some of the most questful, affecting, and imaginative writing from across various Indian languages.\r\nJoin us for a session on Mozhi, Indian literature in translation, and more, where Anil Sarvepalli of Harshaneeyam, a podcast with focus on world literature in translation, will be in conversation with Suchitra Ramachandran, co-founder, Mozhi. Only at Atta Galatta, Indiranagar, on May 18, 2025 at 5.30pm!\nAbout Suchitra\nSuchitra Ramachandran writes fiction in Tamil and translates between Tamil and English. Her work has appeared in journals including Asymptote, Usawa and Narrative Magazine. She won the Asymptote Close Approximations Prize for Fiction Translation in 2017. \u2018The Abyss\u2019, her first full-length translated work, was published by Juggernaut in 2023, and was a finalist in the 2024 ALTA First Translation Prize. Suchitra is also the co-founder of Mozhi, a non-profit initiative that aims to bring together literatures from various Indian languages.\nAbout Anil\nAnil Sarvepalli is a Mechanical Engineer by profession. His hobbies are Reading and Photography. He runs a podcast by name, 'Harshaneeyam', interviewing Telugu Writers and Translators from across the world.",

Titled Ammavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum in Tamil and published by Two Shores Press earlier this month ahead of the Mother\u2019s Day celebration, this new release offers Tamil readers a fresh window into this deeply personal narrative. The original Kannada edition has sold over 30,000 copies and received the Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Award in 2006. The book\u2019s wide-reaching impact is evident\u2014one of its essays features in the Kannada ICSE high school syllabus, and a stage adaptation has been performed more than 50 times at Bengaluru\u2019s iconic Rangashankara theatre.\nThe event will feature Vasudhendra in conversation with Tamil writer B. Kanmani, a powerful literary voice in her own right. The translator, K. Nallathambi, will also join the discussion.\nAmmavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum is a collection of memoir-like essays centered on the author\u2019s mother, with tenderness, wit, and unflinching honesty. This conversation will delve into the original work, the Tamil rendition, and the nuances of translating from Kannada to Tamil.\nIn Perumal Murugan\u2019s words:\n\"Ammavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum, the celebrated Kannada author Vasudhendra\u2019s moving collection of memoir-like essays, offers not just a vivid portrait of his mother but a glimpse into her unique worldview. With a delicate balance of humor and self-mockery, the essays provoke hearty laughter even as they carry the weight of sorrow in many moments. The writing compels you forward\u2014once you finish one essay, you can\u2019t help but leap to the next. This is a book you\u2019ll want to read in a single breath.\"\nTwo Shores Press is a new independent publisher founded under the Brooklyn-based Ulysses Press Indie Accelerator. Focused on literary translation, it is dedicated to bridging linguistic and geographical divides through literature. The Tamil edition of Nammamma Andre Nangishta is a significant addition to the press's expanding collection of translations.",
