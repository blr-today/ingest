But adult friendships? Somewhere, we quiet down.\nWhat is so hard about making friends in adulthood? Is it the intimacy of having other responsibilities? Yet, friendships are known to be one of the greatest determinants of happiness in life. Somehow, we let that flail.\nThis conversational space is to rekindle friendships. To think of the ones who nourish us. To talk about what prevents us from forming deep, intimate relationships with those who aren\u2019t our primary partners. Let\u2019s talk.\nShare the best memories of our childhood and adulthood. And let\u2019s find new friends, shall we? While we cherish the existing ones?\nWhat is MyStories?\nMyStories are community gatherings where we sit down and gently talk about life.\u00a0These are informal gatherings. Some will be facilitated by a mental health professional. Some not.\u00a0But the objective is one: Can we speak? Can we have a conversation with each other? Can strangers meet and part as friends?\nMeet the host\nThis session is hosted by our co-founder and writer, Smitha Murthy.\u00a0Smitha is the author of Worlds Apart, a memoir, and runs MyndStories with her old friend and foe, Swati Nair. One day, she dreams of a world where we build bridges through kindness and where mental health has no stigma.\nWhat should you bring?\nAn item you would like to speak about that holds special meaning for you. It can be anything that you hold close. Reminisce, recollect, retell. We want to hear you speak about the memory closest to your heart.\n\u00a0\nWhat to expect from this session\nA typical MyStories event has a theme around which we open up and share our stories. For this event, \u2018Memories\u2019 is our theme.\u00a0\nWhat this session is not\n\nA dating session\nA networking meet-up\nStartup something or the other\n\nThis is a listen-and-learn-and-connect session.\u00a0\nThe session does not include food and drinks. Any food or drinks can be bought from the cafe at the venue and will be paid for individually.",

    "name": "Liberate Through Lavani - Lecture",
    "description": "Join us for an insightful session that offers a glimpse into the lives of traditional Lavani artists from matriarchal communities. Through an engaging audio-visual presentation, we'll explore the significance of Lavani in modern times, highlighting its themes of love and liberation.\nBhushan has been engaging with Lavani artists since 2002, which led him to write his award-winning book \u2018Sangeet Bari\u2019 in 2014. Based on this book, he created the much-acclaimed show \u2018Sangeet Bari\u2019 \u2018Lavani Ke Rang\u2019, \u2018Love & Lavani\u2019, and \u2018Kahin Pyar Ho Na Jaaen\u2019. He has written Lavani and other songs for music videos produced by \u2018Agents of Ishq\u2019. Bhushan also writes fiction that primarily deals with sexuality and crime. His stories on the \u2018Storytel\u2019 app are widely popular, as are his periodic features in \u2018Loksatta\u2019 and \u2018Mint Lounge' where he chronicles his relationship with unique cuisines. Bhushan has recently translated Shahu Patole\u2019s Marathi book \u2018Dalit Kitchens of Marathwada\u2019 into English.\u00a0\u00a0 (You can rephrase this bio for the workshop - where it will start with my work about eroticas)\nB Spot Productions creates performances that enable communities to share their stories, facilitate the audience to explore sensory pleasures and initiate conversations on taboo topics. They also conduct Lavani workshops, writing workshops, food trails and culture trails. The group is founded by Mumbai based writer Bhushan Korgaonkar with a team of multi-disciplinary collaborators including Geetanjali Kulkarni, Kunal Vijayakar, Anita Date, Reshma Shetty, Wasimbarry Maner and others who create these stories of love & desire, crime & thrill, humour & hope.",
