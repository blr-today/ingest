    "description": "India has a rich tradition of folk arts. The custodians of which are the many tribes that live in the interiors of various states. The Gonds, are the largest Adivasi Community in India and are Dravidian's whose origin can be traced to the pre-Aryan era. They are mainly found in Madhya Pradesh and its surrounding States. The word Gond comes from the Dravidian expression kond, meaning green mountain. In the Gond belief system, besides Bara Deo (Great God), every hill, river, lake, tree, and rock is inhabited by a spirit and therefore sacred. Gond paintings are fascinating, where the artists express their faiths and beliefs, world view, their visual expression and sense of identity, both as a collective, and as individuals. The motifs are further associated with the rich repertoire of the community and strongly show the interactions with the cosmic, natural and social worlds of humans at multiple levels and contexts. Participate in the Gond Painting Workshop, get a chance to appreciate the art form and create you very own Gond Art masterpiece on cartridge sheets with acrylic colours.\nTake away: One complete painting A3 size\nBook Here: 9867982075",

    "description": "Discord to Symphony by Dr. Mythri Ramachandra is a compelling and insightful journey through the intricacies of human relationships and personal transformation.\u00a0\nHer second book, Many Shades of Marriage: Reflecting Respect, Friendship, and Compassion, deals with a variety of characters whose lives intertwine through the thread of marriage. From the initial stages of infatuation and blossoming love to the decision to marry and the inevitable challenges that follow, each story reflects the myriad ways in which marriage is perceived and lived. Some characters see marriage as a solution to financial woes, believing it can provide stability and security. Others view it as a convenient escape from personal responsibility, or as a social trophy to enhance their status. There are also characters who fear commitment and seek the freedom of an open marriage, and those who enter marriage with pure intentions, only to find themselves at a crossroads of expectation and reality.\nShe has written Many Shades of Marriage along with Ms. Prapulla. Join us for the launch of both books at Atta Galatta on 28th September, Saturday, at 11 AM!",

    "name": "Kalighat Painting Workshop - Art Workshop",
    "description": "The paintings derive its name from the Kalighat Temple which flourished as a popular art form with the rise of a settlement around the temple. Legend has it that Sati slew herself after Lord Shiva was insulted by her father Daksha. Following this, Shiva wandered with her body on his shoulder threatening to destroy the universe. Vishnu, the preserver of Earth, intervened and shattered Sati\u2019s body into 51 pieces which fell at different spots across the Indian subcontinent. These sites are known as Shakti Peethas. The toe of her right foot is said to have fallen at the site of the Kalighat Temple, associating it with Goddess Kalib- the ferocious form of Sati.\nWith bright colours, bold strokes, realistic figures, religious, as well as secular and civil subjects; these paintings catch the eyes of the appreciator in a jiffy. The subjects in the paintings are coloured but the base remains untouched. These characteristics came to be known as the key elements of the Kalighat paintings. The Kalighat Paintings were divided into two schools: The oriental school wherein Hindu gods and mythological figures were seen, and the occidental school that projected social evils and other secular themes.\nIn this fascinating workshop we will be working on a painting of Goddess Kali with acrylic paints on cartridge sheets. You will get to take away one complete painting (A3 size). The registration price is inclusive of all materials.\nBook Here: 9867982075",

In fact,\u00a0you would be given a free book and a free drink\u00a0from us.\nThese books are a surprise and the puppies would be running around you.\nBut, why on earth should I join Pawga?\nUmmm, because we\u2019re cool. Kiddding!!! (not really).\nAll the puppies or older dogs you see at Pawga are from your local animal shelter. They are all up for adoption and the best part is that a portion of the tickets go towards the welfare of animals at the shelter. In Bangalore we work with Charlie\u2019s Animal Rescue.\nWhy does any of this matter amidst all my existential crisis and joys?\nBecause sometimes you shouldn\u2019t worry too much with \u2018because\u2019.\nBecause at some level you know you need to contribute to your wellness and really take care of yourself. Art therapy at its simplest form with puppies might be a small way to help yourself.\nBecause these puppies/dogs don\u2019t get the affection they need and even if you can\u2019t exactly know with their wagging tails, you meeting them could be the best day in their life.",

Here we are going to introduce Persian mandalas, their meaning, and characteristics.\nWhat is a Mandala?\nWhat we know about a mandala is that it is a geometric design and a symbol in Buddhism and Hinduism. In general, mandalas represent the universe. Mandalas are usually used to increase focus while meditating or doing yoga. In home d\u00e9cor designs, mandala tapestries, paintings or tiles can be hanged on the wall or used as a tablecloth or for bedding. In some cases, mandalas are used in decors because of their magnificent patterns and symbolic meaning for peace. Mandalas are very much engaged with home d\u00e9cor styles such as bohemian, hippie and gypsy in the modern design world.\nWhere do mandalas come from?\nMost of us might think mandalas root back only to India and Buddhism while there has been a wide use of mandala designs in the history of art in other religions and areas as well.\nMandala designs are applied in Persian art and architecture frequently.

The practice combines Kriya, physical asanas, breathing exercises/ Pranayama, and Meditation, which collectively address both the physical and psychological aspects of addiction. Deep breathing techniques like pranayama can help manage cravings and reduce stress, a common trigger for smoking. Regular yoga practice improves overall body awareness, potentially making smokers more conscious of tobacco`s harmful effects. Meditation and mindfulness aspects of yoga can enhance self-control and help individuals develop healthier coping mechanisms. Additionally, yoga`s focus on holistic well-being may motivate individuals to make other positive lifestyle changes, supporting their journey to quit smoking. The improved lung capacity and circulation from yoga practice can also aid in physical recovery from long-term tobacco use.",
