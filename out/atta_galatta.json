    "name": "Little Architects of Bengaluru: Designing A Smarter City in India - Hands-on Workshop on Technology, Design, and History for Kids",
    "description": "Over the past few years, we\u2019ve been thinking about how kids grow up with technology \u2014 swiping, tapping, watching \u2014 but rarely building with it. And as parents, while we worry about screen time, we\u2019re often unsure what the alternative looks like.\nNow, with AI everywhere, it\u2019s tempting to think they don\u2019t need to understand how technology works \u2014 that it\u2019ll do the thinking for them.\nAt Playquakes, we believe the opposite.\n\"Understanding and creating with technology has never been more important\"\nThat\u2019s why we design hands-on, interdisciplinary workshops that blend tech with history, architecture, and design \u2014 helping kids not just consume the world around them, but reimagine and rebuild it.\nLittle Architects of Bengaluru\u00a0is one of our first in this series \u2014 a 3-hour experience where 9\u201314 year olds explore the science of electricity while designing solutions for their own city.\n\ud83d\udca1\u00a0Workshop Fee:\u00a0\u20b92499/-\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfeb\u00a0\u00a0Led by a team of passionate educators who believe in empowering children to create with technology\u2014not just consume it.\u00a0Uttarika Shetty, with a background in\u00a0 Learning Sciences from Columbia University, designs technology-driven experiences where children learn by making\u2014encouraging them to explore, tinker, and solve real-world problems with confidence.\u00a0Swati Shelar, a designer trained at NID and Stanford, brings over a decade of experience crafting playful, meaningful learning tools\u2014trusted by organizations like UNICEF and NCERT\u2014to help children grow with empathy and creativity.",

Titled Ammavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum in Tamil and published by Two Shores Press earlier this month ahead of the Mother\u2019s Day celebration, this new release offers Tamil readers a fresh window into this deeply personal narrative. The original Kannada edition has sold over 30,000 copies and received the Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Award in 2006.

Nallathambi, will also join the discussion.\nAmmavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum is a collection of memoir-like essays centered on the author\u2019s mother, with tenderness, wit, and unflinching honesty. This conversation will delve into the original work, the Tamil rendition, and the nuances of translating from Kannada to Tamil.\nIn Perumal Murugan\u2019s words:\n\"Ammavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum, the celebrated Kannada author Vasudhendra\u2019s moving collection of memoir-like essays, offers not just a vivid portrait of his mother but a glimpse into her unique worldview.

The writing compels you forward\u2014once you finish one essay, you can\u2019t help but leap to the next. This is a book you\u2019ll want to read in a single breath.\"\nTwo Shores Press is a new independent publisher founded under the Brooklyn-based Ulysses Press Indie Accelerator.

Published 80 years ago, The Little Prince remains one of the most profound stories written in the past century. Every sentence in the book tucks away much more between the layers than what seems to appear. A story that offers a strange sense of novelty in every re-reading.\nThe workshop with a number of modalities, and reflective prompts will bring alive The Little Prince's laughter and grief, his sudden arrival, and his farewell light as a feather - through the story, we shall go into a pilgrimage of our own to find poems neatly tucked in the pleats of our essential experiences. No prior poetry writing experience is needed - just bring the curiosity & the untamed spirit of The Little Prince.\nNote: The medium of the workshop and the referred text will be in English.\nWhat's included?\n- Poetry writing prompts & exercises along with facilitated reflection\n- Delving into themes of wonderment, curiosity & creativity through varied activities\n- Recitation & discussion on hand-picked excerpts from 'The Little Prince's' story\n- Self-reflection & group-based activities to brush away the writer's block",
