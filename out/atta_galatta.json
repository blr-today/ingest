The manor on top of the hill\u2014a remnant of British colonization\u2014bears scars of violence. Locals murmur of gruesome murders that have stained its past and ghosts that lurk in its corners.\n\r\nDecades ago, when young Eesho had first arrived at the bungalow as the supervisor of the rubber plantation, along with his wife and their faithful dog, life had seemed blissful. But beneath the quiet, unrest simmered as estate workers banded together against the owners, and whispers of a rising radical-left Naxalite movement grew louder. As the turmoil escalated, it threatened to sweep away everything that Eesho held dear.\n\r\nNow, even as Aleyamma is consumed with grief over the loss of her grandfather, the dark history of her inheritance makes its presence known. Estranged from her Syrian Christian family, Aleyamma sets out to untangle the knots of the past. What stories will she uncover? Will she be able to draw strength from them to confront the present?\n\r\nSet in the verdant rubber plantations of Kerala,\u00a0The Remnants of Rebellion\u00a0is an enthralling debut novel by Ponnu Elizabeth Mathew that spans three generations. It is a story of rebellions\u2014both personal and political\u2014and of people caught in the aftermath of colonization.

    "description": "The Bengaluru Poetry Festival is the city\u2019s only literary event dedicated to poetry. Organized by the not-for-profit Bengaluru Poetry Festival trust, the event has seen eight successful years and has attracted thousands of poetry lovers each year.\nThe eight years of the festival has seen participation from over 450 poets, musicians, lyricists and performers and the programming has included Individual performances, Panel discussions, Workshops and Readings. The festival has brought poets and poetry from across the country, with substantial regional and ethnic flavours to the audiences of Bangalore.\nThe festival has grown to become a beloved fixture in the literary and cultural calendar of the city, and is now being recognised across the country.\nThe Bengaluru Poetry Festival was conceptualized as a celebration of all things poetry. From the classical to the modern, from hymn to haiku, from ballad to ode, poetry is what makes language dance. The rhyme, the rhythm, the words all merge into the perfect pitch, so we think and ache, and remain human.\nThe festival was conceptualized, when the founders of the festival realized that while poetry as a form of self-expression was gaining immense popularity, and Indian poets, and poetry were increasingly being recognized the world over, there were limited opportunities available for poets within existing literary festival platforms. Thus was born the Bengaluru Poetry Festival in 2016, a platform for poets, and poetry.\nAn inherent love for poetry brought the core team together \u2013 to plan this festival in a spirit of gratitude and joy, as a salute to poets and the magical, magical world of their compositions.",

    "description": "The Bengaluru Poetry Festival is the city\u2019s only literary event dedicated to poetry. Organized by the not-for-profit Bengaluru Poetry Festival trust, the event has seen eight successful years and has attracted thousands of poetry lovers each year.\nThe eight years of the festival has seen participation from over 450 poets, musicians, lyricists and performers and the programming has included Individual performances, Panel discussions, Workshops and Readings. The festival has brought poets and poetry from across the country, with substantial regional and ethnic flavours to the audiences of Bangalore.\nThe festival has grown to become a beloved fixture in the literary and cultural calendar of the city, and is now being recognised across the country.\nThe Bengaluru Poetry Festival was conceptualized as a celebration of all things poetry. From the classical to the modern, from hymn to haiku, from ballad to ode, poetry is what makes language dance. The rhyme, the rhythm, the words all merge into the perfect pitch, so we think and ache, and remain human.\nThe festival was conceptualized, when the founders of the festival realized that while poetry as a form of self-expression was gaining immense popularity, and Indian poets, and poetry were increasingly being recognized the world over, there were limited opportunities available for poets within existing literary festival platforms. Thus was born the Bengaluru Poetry Festival in 2016, a platform for poets, and poetry.\nAn inherent love for poetry brought the core team together \u2013 to plan this festival in a spirit of gratitude and joy, as a salute to poets and the magical, magical world of their compositions.",

    "description": "A right-wing zealot and a left-wing rebel walk into a protest... and accidentally fall in love.\nWhat follows is a pregnancy no ideology could predict and a child born into a country already arguing over his first words. Butter & Mashed Banana is a razor-sharp, rhythm-driven satire about censorship, identity, and inherited confusion.\nThrough music, mockery and just enough movement to keep the chairs from revolting, it tells the story of a boy trapped between extremes - political, parental and poetic - who grows up to commit the most dangerous act of all: writing. Funny, furious and gloriously nonsensical, this theatrical reading asks - in a world obsessed with sides, can a voice still speak from the middle?",
