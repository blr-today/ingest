    "description": "On 29 November 2016, the Nagrota Army Base in Jammu and Kashmir was attacked by a group of terrorists. The highly trained and heavily armed terrorists had infiltrated from across the LoC and gained entry from the forest behind the camp. Firing mercilessly to cause maximum damage, they were on a revenge mission after the Indian Army's successful surgical strikes on terror camps just two months earlier. The Indian Army personnel inside the camp played a crucial role in securing the lives of those present in the family accommodations as well as the camp, and many bravely laid down their lives. Nagrota Under Siege, the book, is the story of grit, courage and unmatched bravery.\nJoin us to meet the author, Bhaavna Arora, at Atta Galatta, on 26th January at 12 PM and to get your copies signed!",

    "description": "Great things happen when women connect.\nSound is the source of this entire creation.\nDid you know that the sound of the musical notes have a profoundly positive impact on our chakras?\nWhether you receive the sounds from sacred singing bowls meant for the purpose of healing or well-being, or you sing the notes yourself, they bring in a sense of balance.\nAs this balance fosters feelings of joy and peace, it can aid creative expression in many forms.\nPainting is one such creative form that is closely associated with sound and music. The choice of colours, mood and theme, sensory and emotional experience while painting gets influenced by the presence of sound and music in the environment where art is taking place impacting the artistic process and the final creation.\nInspired by this, we have a similar collaboration with artists Shilpi, Ayuushi, Priyanka and Khusbu who aspire to hold a Sound & Art Workshop for women wishing to experience such intense joy and creativity on 8th March 2025, International Women\u2019s Day.\nIt would be a treat to observe the participants flow with the sounds and express their art.\nTake away:\nPainting to add vibrancy to your room or your living. An ideal gift that you can make, gift and surprise anyone.\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to receive encouragement from peer women.\nWhat to Bring:\n\nYoga mat.\nShawl / stole.\nDrinking water bottle.\n\nNo prior art experience is necessary.\nParticipants should come with an open mind. All other materials will be provided.\nWear comfortable, light color cotton / linen clothing as absorbing the vibrations is easier.\nRegistration: Spaces are limited, so early registration is encouraged.",
