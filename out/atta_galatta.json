    "name": "Indian Millenials - Book Talk",
    "description": "There are 440 million Millennials (born between 1980 and 1996) in India today. They constitute 34 per cent of the country\u2019s population and 46 per cent of the workforce. They are the chief wage earners in most households. They are the first generation to grow up in a non-socialist economy. Consumerism permeates every single aspect of their lives. The food they eat, the workout regimes they follow, the language they speak, their professed ideological and political beliefs\u2014all these are dictated by capitalism. Great bodies and English-speaking skills are crucial social aspirations\u2014not only to boost their self-worth but also to make them stand out in the fledgling world of Indian dating. They are the first generation tasked with navigating a post-truth world where all assertions are double-faced, elastic, and subject to wilful misinterpretation. All these facets of the Millennial generation are speculated about but poorly understood.\n\u00a0So, who are Indian Millennials, really? What are the attitudes and lifestyle choices that define their views on politics; gender and sexuality; work and income; caste and class; love, marriage, and family; mental health and well-being, and much, much more? In this eye-opening book, A. M. Gautam (a Millennial himself) travels across the country, meeting Millennials in small towns and big cities, to provide a fascinating account of one of the most distinctive generations of our time. Join him for an equally fascinating talk based on the book, where he will be in conversation with Swati Hegde.",

One day, she dreams of a world where we build bridges through kindness and where mental health has no stigma.\nWhat should you bring?\nAn item you would like to speak about that holds special meaning for you. It can be anything that you hold close. Reminisce, recollect, retell. We want to hear you speak about the memory closest to your heart.\nWhat to expect from this session\nA typical MyStories event has a theme around which we open up and share our stories.
