The topics could be varied like History, Sports, Music, Literature, Movies and more. A team of two members would get to choose a topic and the level of difficulty and the question would be revealed. The rest of the teams can go for the buzzer if they know the answer. Depending on the number\u00a0of teams registering, the size of the grid would be decided.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSAMPLE Qu: 2. The name is inspired by the traditional malt whisky distillation process in which malted barley was mixed by hand with shovels. This labor-intensive process often caused a shoulder injury to workers, causing their arms to hang low. Which brand is named thus?\u00a0\nGanesh Balakrishnan is an entrepreneur, marketer and creator of terrible dad jokes. His claim to fame is attempting to sell shoes during the pandemic, culminating in a viral Shark Tank \"Down But Not Out\" appearance. He is a collector of useless facts since childhood, and has dabbled in trivia quiz circuits since college. ganesh.flatheads@gmail.com\n\r\nKarthik Srinivasan is a pseudo-retired software leader by choice, specializing in innovative ideas to spend time that include organizing cricket leagues at the scale of IPL but for free, staying up to date on latest debates in virtual social groups helmed by family and friends and more on similar lines. emailkarth@gmail.com",

    "description": "Join in for an interactive experiment-led science session by physics educator and writer Madhuri Katti and some of her students. The goal of the session is to show young students and adults a different and engaging way of thinking about science, history of scientific ideas and its effects on everyday life, by exploring fundamental topics via simple home-experiments. The experiments will be of three parts:\n- Fun with Forces: Explanation of the four fundamental forces of nature, and their effects. Demonstration of experiments with gravity and static electricity.\u00a0\n- Magnets and Motors : construction of a simple motor with a battery, magnet, and copper wire. Discussion of electricity and magnetism.\n- Playing with fluids: demonstrations of dynamics of fluids involving surface tension, and diffusion. Light along with Fluids.\nAt the end, we hope to inspire the participants to be boldly curious and to recognise the importance of science in our everyday lives.",

    "name": "The Stray Dogs of Landour Network: A True Story by a Failed Dog Trainer - Book Launch by Lalitha Krishnan",
    "description": "Lalitha Krishnan will introduce her new memoir in an interactive session. Released earlier this year, the book is available in both print and e-book formats on Amazon, Pothi.com, and Flipkart. It is a testament to the profound lessons of compassion, resilience, and belonging taught by free-ranging dogs.\nThe story begins in Landour, where Krishnan, a newly certified dog trainer fighting battles of her own, encounters a troubled stray named Pretty on her doorstep. With a training manual in hand, she intends to help Pretty find a home. But Pretty has a different plan, and with quiet intelligence, she leads Krishnan into her world, introducing her to her pup and the rest of the pack.\nInspired by the philosophy of Ubuntu (\u201cI am because we are\u201d), Krishnan finds herself feeding, training, and caring for a growing network of dogs in an international neighbourhood. In doing so, she begins to heal, learning that her canine companions have as much to teach her as she has to teach them. The dogs, with their innate wisdom and social dynamics, reshape Krishnan\u2019s understanding of love and survival.\nThe Stray Dogs of Landour Network: A True Story by a Failed Dog Trainer features a foreword by the late travel writer Bill Aitken, who also contributed a chapter titled \u201cMussoorie Dogs and Dog Lovers I Love.\u201d Krishnan recounts stories shared by authors Stephen Alter and Ganesh Saili, both residents of Landour. Her book is a tribute to the silent, unseen lives of the animals who share our world and the emotional truths they awaken within us.\nReview:\n\u201cThe Stray Dogs of Landour Network is a deeply personal, unflinchingly honest memoir that sits comfortably on the shelf alongside Helen Macdonald\u2019s H Is for Hawk or Sy Montgomery\u2019s The Soul of an Octopus. It is a story of survival, not just of dogs, but of people finding grace in the act of caring without conditions.\u00a0\nA poignant, slow-blooming debut that blends environmental awareness with emotional depth. Lalitha Krishnan\u2019s voice is one of rare integrity, grounded, observant, and quietly radical in its compassion.\u201d\n\u00a0\u2014 The Literature Today\nAbout the Author:\nLalitha Krishnan is a writer, podcaster, potter, and nature documenter based in Ranikhet in the Indian Himalaya. Her work explores the bonds between humans, animals, and the natural world. A certified dog trainer, Krishnan is passionate about dogs and wildlife and has contributed to publications including Dogs & Pups Magazine, Garhwal Post, RoundGlass Sustain, and Sanctuary Asia, among others.",

    "name": "Meet & Greet: Dr. Latha & Dr. Ranjan Pejaver - Author Interaction Event",
    "description": "It is seldom that we find a blend of two mainstream professions.\u00a0 Despite being busy in their respective specialities, Dr Latha Venkateswaran and Dr Ranjan Pejaver have taken time to explore the art of writing. While they have written articles and papers which are mainly medical, it is heartening to know they have ventured into writing fiction in the not-so-recent past.\nWelcome to an evening with two doctors-turned-published-authors who would like to meet and greet you. You will also be treated to soulful melodies played beautifully on the saxophone by Asha Elisha, an accomplished singer and musician.\nAbout Dr. Latha:\nDr Latha is a practicing pediatric surgeon for twenty years now. She did her undergrad from Kasturba Medical College (KMC), Mangalore, and her post-graduation FRCS (Paediatric Surgery) from the UK. She currently lives and works in Bangalore, India. This is her first attempt at story telling. Reading and writing have always been her passion. She loves thrillers and twists and brings out the most unique way of portraying this in all her stories. Her husband, son, and daughter ably support her in her passion. Ripples is a collection of short stories. It is a work of fiction. The author has attempted to present real life situations in a story form. They are all different in their content but have a characteristic twist at the end of the story.\nDr Ranjan Pejaver:\nDr Ranjan Pejaver is a renowned Pediatrician and Neonatologist. Dr Ranjan Pejaver has to his credit, more than 30 books and 150 scientific papers in his speciality. An innovator and researcher, he is an eminent speaker and a sought-after teacher. He is a well-travelled person. \u201cThe Heaven As I Saw\u201d is a thoughtful, imaginative take on life; more rather, life soon after death! In his first non-medial book, the author Dr Ranjan Pejaver, has deftly handled the most unusual theme, holding the readers\u2019 attention all the while. The novel is earthly and penetrative. It interrogates questions of morality and ethics in modern society. A most unusual journey of the Hero of the book. He gains wisdom through this trip. Could be inspiring for the readers.\nAbout Asha Elisha:\nAsha Elisha hails from a musical family, and has been a musician and singer all her life. She realised her dream of playing the saxophone in October 2022, when she began taking lessons from a professional musician. Since then, she hasn\u2019t looked back, and has built up her saxophone repertoire to cover English Retro, Jazz, Gospel, Western Classical and Bollywood songs. Asha is available to play for musical gigs. You can listen to her recordings on YouTube: @ohsosaxy-7 (Oh So Saxy)",

    "name": "Healing of shame - Workshop by Nimesh and Gokul",
    "description": "Shame is the most complex emotional suffering one experiences in a lifetime. Every dimension of one\u2019s life from relationships to one\u2019s professional identity and being a part of one\u2019s social reality can be influenced by shame and yet it remains unknown to many among us. Shame is the intense feeling of undeservingness to be loved and to exist. To begin with, the workshop intends to explain healing as a change which needs to transpire in one with the ultimate goal being to outline how we can bring about a change when one is consumed by shame. We will delve into the specific ways shame manifests across different layers of consciousness, and discuss targeted interventions that can address shame at each layer.\nThe workshop is hosted by Dr. Nimesh and Dr. Gokul, both practicing psychologists based in Bangalore.",
