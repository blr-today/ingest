When a request from Babylon to trade weapons arrives as a blessing in disguise, a trade delegation, headed by prince Arjuna, and the grizzled veteran, Shrutasena, sets off for the faraway kingdom.\n\r\nAn encounter with Lilith, the fierce bodyguard to the Queen, and more importantly, a woman who is hell-bent on despising Arjuna, leaves him flustered. But there\u2019s more to Lilith than meets the eye. The woman is a formidable soldier, but something about her reminds Arjuna of home, Bharatavarsha.\n\r\nBut as fate would have it, Arjun and Lilith find themselves entrenched in a political ploy to overthrow Babylon\u2019s King, Sin-Mubalit. Will they be able to stop the usurpers to the throne? And can they trust each other to have their backs as they do so, even as they\u2019re uncovering new secrets on the go?\n\r\nInspired by the twentieth century discovery of a Sumerian tablet off the coast of Mumbai, Daughter of Two Rivers\u00a0is a homecoming story. And like all good homecoming stories, it\u2019s a story of learning what home means\u2015across countries, and across time. Join us for the launch at Atta Galatta, and meet the author!",

    "description": "Prana, Energy, Life Force - every culture has a different name for it, but we all intuitively know what it is: the essence that makes up everything around us. Isn\u2019t it fascinating that we\u2019re all made up of the same stuff, yet each form looks so different? Inspired by the narrative storytelling technique of Indian epics, seemingly unrelated stories will weave in and out of each other, forming a wonderful tapestry of intertwined stories. After successful runs in Berlin, Stockholm and Hanoi, Improv Lore is pleased to bring its signature show \u201cReincarnations\u201d to Bengaluru! Completely unscripted, this show promises the audience unexpected twists, a glimpse into other worlds and a reminder that every ending is just another beginning.",
