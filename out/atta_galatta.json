    "name": "Soul Climate - Book Launch by Inez Baranay",
    "description": "Atta Galatta is delighted to host the launch of Soul Climate, the latest novel by acclaimed writer Inez Baranay. Inventive in form and rich with historical texture, Soul Climate reimagines the idea of India through the perspective of Turkish intellectual and freedom fighter Halide Edib, who visited Delhi in 1935 to deliver a series of lectures.\nThe novel deftly blends fact and fiction. Edib\u2019s encounters with figures of India\u2019s independence movement, including her conversations with Mahatma Gandhi, unfold alongside the fictional journeys of three young women whose lives are shaped by her words. Through these intertwined narratives, Soul Climate explores enduring questions of nationhood, communalism, idealism, and the ties that connect and divide us.\nInez Baranay, author of nine novels, has long been celebrated for her globally engaged and stylistically innovative work. Her earlier books Neem Dreams and With the Tiger were first published in India to critical acclaim.\nThe launch event will be hosted by Bhumika Anand, Founder and Director of the Bangalore Writers Workshop.",

    "name": "My Life Closed Twice - Book Launch by Subhashini Kaligotla",
    "description": "Author Subhashini Kaligotla launches her new poetry collection My Life Closed Twice (Copper Coin, 2025), with Jeet Thayil.\nIn My Life Closed Twice, Subhashini Kaligotla charts the long aftermath of grief, and its recursive, obsessive cadences. Drawing on premodern India\u2019s art, literature, and history, through invented forms and received ones, in fragments, litanies, lists, and queries, the poems in this spare volume embody the psychological terrain of the grieving. Two premature deaths are at the heart of the book. Kaligotla writes of their immediate aftereffects and their enduring impact. She braids her voice with voices from India\u2019s past\u2014from the unknown bards of the Sanskrit epics who counsel equanimity in the face of catastrophe to the laments of Ashoka, Bilhana, and Jahangir.\r\n\u00a0\nAuthor Bio\nSubhashini Kaligotla is a poet and an art historian of ancient and medieval South Asia. She is author of the poetry collection Bird of the Indian Subcontinent and the monograph Shiva\u2019s Waterfront Temples. She teaches at Columbia, dividing her time between New York City and Hyderabad.\r\n\u00a0\nAdvance Praise for My Life Closed Twice\nSubhashini Kaligotla\u2019s ingeniously fashioned poetic structures\u2014which are light, flexible, delicate yet possessed of remarkable tensile strength and architectural clarity and integrity\u2014aren\u2019t just beautiful in themselves. They\u2019re also vessels for deep imaginative feeling and thinking and wondering and longing. She has a unique, compelling lyric voice and a distinguished twenty-first century consciousness.\n- Vijay Seshadri\nAnger, denial, bargaining, despair, all the stages of grief except acceptance, each stage overlaid with the forensic precision generated by love when it has nowhere to go. These enraged, laceratingly plainspoken poems burn with the singular self-awareness that is the writer's curse, and the writer's gift. Two deaths enclose the book like 'two dates // enclosed / by parentheses'. It is impossible to read, say, 'Only Your Brother Will You Lose' \u2013 its fifty shards hammered into the flesh like fifty nine-inch nails \u2013 and come away unscathed.\u00a0\n- Jeet Thayil",
