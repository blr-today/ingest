    "description": "Having worked all his life, Shivaswamy eagerly awaits the serenity of retirement. But his plans are suddenly upturned when his attempts to buy a house are scuppered by unscrupulous builders. Suddenly, he realizes that he might have to join the workforce again. What follows is a tale of gentle satire that is also an intense human drama. Shivaswamy faces the toughest choice, one that threatens the values that have sustained him throughout his life.\nSet in contemporary Bengaluru, What\u2019s Your Price, Mr Shivaswamy? is an elegantly crafted and deeply engaging story about a man torn between material necessities and spiritual aspirations. How much would you sacrifice for some peace of mind?\nTranslated into English by the author himself, this novel was originally published in Kannada as Ondondu Talegu Ondondu Bele. Join us for a discussion with the author on 19th July at 6.30 PM!",
