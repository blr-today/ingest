But trust me, the name is nothing compared to the ridiculousness of my life. And here\u2019s why we call ourselves brats in Sawalpur, a town dominated by the cement plant:\n\nAs children of wage board workers, we faced injustice and weren\u2019t allowed to enter the officers\u2019 colony. But I had the guts to sneak into my girlfriend\u2019s quarters\u2014don\u2019t ask why.\nMy best friend, Baiju, had the audacity to have an affair\u2014sorry, a relationship\u2014with the colony\u2019s schoolteacher.\nOur so-called ordinary life was filled with mischief, adventures, and escapades.\nOur shift to an ultra-ordinary life came with reckless schemes and acts of revenge, making the lives of the factory officers, who took their privilege a bit too literally, a living hell\u2014just to prove our worth.\nMy problem? I take things to heart and always make sure to get back at those who hurt me. This time, it was the cement company that wronged me, and I made sure to give back royally.\n\nRead The Colony Brats to learn how not to screw up your life\u2014and everyone else's\u2014with vengeance. Get ready to laugh, cry, and rethink everything as you follow our journey from innocent kids to not-so-innocent troublemaking adults.

And if that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019s also a seasoned Training Manager\u2014though I\u2019ve got a few \u201ctraining\u201d stories of my own he wouldn\u2019t dare share!\nSo, whether you're here for the stories, the laughs, or just to see what kind of madness unfolds, be there.
