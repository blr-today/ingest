We follow her through cities and towns as she tries to make sense of the old while confronting the new. But each move trails chaos in its wake.\nRestless and acerbic, she struggles to come to terms with the disintegration of her parents\u2019 marriage, eerily mirrored in the political turmoil of twenty-first-century India. And crucial to Sophia\u2019s story\u2014which unfolds against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, the 2020 Delhi riots and a global pandemic\u2014is her complex, thorny friendship with Medha, a queer artist with travails of her own.\nHow does one even begin to fit in when apathy becomes a mode of survival? How is it possible to truly belong when one feels estranged from oneself? Sophia\u2019s journey is not just her own but that of any young woman who finds herself caught \u2018in between\u2019\u2014unable to back down and refusing to conform\u2014and who doesn\u2019t quite feel rooted to one place or identity.\nNo Place to Call My Own is an intimate, arresting portrait of millennial disquiet in a mercurial, volatile world. Join us for the Bangalore release of this book with the author, who will be in conversation with acclaimed poet Jeet Thayil,",

The choice of colours, mood and theme, sensory and emotional experience while painting gets influenced by the presence of sound and music in the environment where art is taking place impacting the artistic process and the final creation.\nInspired by this, we have a similar collaboration with artists Shilpi, Ayuushi, Priyanka and Khusbu who aspire to hold a Sound & Art Workshop for women wishing to experience such intense joy and creativity on 8th March 2025, International Women\u2019s Day.\nIt would be a treat to observe the participants flow with the sounds and express their art.\nTake away:\nPainting to add vibrancy to your room or your living.

The Gonds, are the largest Adivasi Community in India and are Dravidian's whose origin can be traced to the pre-Aryan era. They are mainly found in Madhya Pradesh and its surrounding States. The word Gond comes from the Dravidian expression kond, meaning green mountain. In the Gond belief system, besides Bara Deo (Great God), every hill, river, lake, tree, and rock is inhabited by a spirit and therefore sacred. Gond paintings are fascinating, where the artists express their faiths and beliefs, world view, their visual expression and sense of identity, both as a collective, and as individuals. The motifs are further associated with the rich repertoire of the community and strongly show the interactions with the cosmic, natural and social worlds of humans at multiple levels and contexts. Participate in the Gond Painting Workshop, get a chance to appreciate the art form and create you very own Gond Art masterpiece on cartridge sheets with acrylic colours.\nTake away: One complete painting A3 size",
