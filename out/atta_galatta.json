    "description": "Finding Freedom: for those tired of fitting into boxes.\nThis is for anyone who\u2019s ever felt stuck in an old version of themselves \u2014 the overachiever, the always-nice one, the fixer, the dependable friend.\nYou may not relate to those roles anymore, but they still follow you around.\nThis workshop is a chance to pause and ask: Who am I now? And what do I want to leave behind?\nWe\u2019ll talk, write, and reflect. It\u2019s not heavy therapy stuff \u2014 but it is honest, vulnerable, and maybe a little uncomfortable in the best way.\nYou\u2019ll leave with a clearer sense of what you`re ready to outgrow, and what kind of freedom you`re craving next \u2014 at work, in relationships, in how you show up every day.\n\u2728 This session is built on an exercise from my upcoming book on insecurities \u2014 so you`re getting early access to one of the most powerful tools I\u2019ve created.\nCome alone, or bring a friend. You`ll meet others in the middle of their own \u2018figuring it out\u2019 \u2014 and you just might feel less alone in yours.\nNo pressure. Just presence. Come as you are. No journaling experience needed.\n\ud83e\ude91 Limited seats only (15 max)\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f INR 350 & INR 250 (early bird offer)\n\ud83d\udcd4 Please bring a notebook and pen along\nFacilitator: Sonali Dutta, Founder of Youmanize.",

The rest of the teams can go for the buzzer if they know the answer. Depending on the number\u00a0of teams registering, the size of the grid would be decided.\u00a0\nSAMPLE Qu: 2.
