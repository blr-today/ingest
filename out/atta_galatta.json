We follow, among others, Palestinian journalist and therapist Ashira Darwish, activist Ahed Tamimi, Israeli journalist Amira Hass, and Dr. Gabor Mat\u00e9\u2019s trauma-healing work with women tortured in Israeli prisons. Ancient landscapes bear deep scars, having witnessed the brutal reality of ancestral land confiscation, expulsion, imprisonment, home demolition, water deprivation, and denial of basic human rights. Through a veil of oppression, we glimpse resilience \u2013 deep roots that have carried Palestinians through decades of darkness and shattered lives. This film lays bare the humanity of the oppressed while grappling with the question: what makes the oppressor so ruthlessly blind to its own cruelty?\nOrganised by End The War On People.\nAbout the Screening: End The War On People brings to you 'Unoccupy' as a call to refuse to accept the normalisation of the apartheid and genocidal state of Israel while it exports its fascist model to India and the world.\nWe refuse to look away as Israel uses cultural platforms to \u2018artwash\u2019 the ongoing annihilation of Gaza & West Bank and its attacks on Lebanon.",
