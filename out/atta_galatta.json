The topics could be varied like History, Sports, Music, Literature, Movies and more. A team of two members would get to choose a topic and the level of difficulty and the question would be revealed. The rest of the teams can go for the buzzer if they know the answer. Depending on the number\u00a0of teams registering, the size of the grid would be decided.\u00a0\nSAMPLE Qu: 2. The name is inspired by the traditional malt whisky distillation process in which malted barley was mixed by hand with shovels. This labor-intensive process often caused a shoulder injury to workers, causing their arms to hang low.

Butter & Mashed Banana is a razor-sharp, rhythm-driven satire about censorship, identity, and inherited confusion.\nThrough music, mockery and just enough movement to keep the chairs from revolting, it tells the story of a boy trapped between extremes - political, parental and poetic - who grows up to commit the most dangerous act of all: writing. Funny, furious and gloriously nonsensical, this theatrical reading asks - in a world obsessed with sides, can a voice still speak from the middle?",

The first of many.\nAs Narois's father struggles to adapt; as her parents' marriage comes apart; as Narois herself tries to make sense of the goings-on---is her mother having an affair; is she planning to abandon the family forever?---she creeps away into the dark, magical-real Jahanpanah forest to escape. Here, she encounters the Jugnus---legendary healers and weather-workers. Silver Samir, their handsome leader, Mian Pagla who followed the river, Kochi who is bendy when sad, and Velu the gentle murderer mesmerize Narois with their tales; she will do what she can to belong to them.\nIt is a world on the brink, where the mother Narois leans on may be unable to protect her and where betrayal can be love in disguise. Lyrical, precocious and devastatingly tender, Age of Mondays is a story of star-crossed friendships and childhood in a trembling, terrifying era.\nJoin us for a discussion with the author on 9th August at 4 PM! Lopa Ghosh will be in conversation with Dharini Bhaskar.",
