These poems are a quiet observation of our responses to the passing of these events and of our efforts to understand this world that offers experiences of duality \u2014 of wars and peacetime, abundance and poverty, of love and hate. Ode to Broken Things is also a prayer and an earnest dream for a peaceful world for everyone, where all hearts are warm and borders are always open.\nIn Ode to Broken Things, we are taken to the heart of matter \u2014 to observe the atomic, the molecular, the granular parts of our inner and outer worlds that we miss amid the unsettling busyness. Ode to Broken Things invites us to feel, see, think and wonder about all that surrounds us. Raw and uncut, these poetic expressions draw us towards hope.\n\u00a0\u2013 Vinutha Mallya [Journalist, editor and lecturer]",

    "name": "Come Sit With Us - A Meetup by My Divorce Guide",
    "description": "It is an intimate, offline gathering designed for those navigating separation, relationship transitions, or quiet personal reinvention. It is a gentle, held space where stories will be shared across the room \u2014 without performance, without spotlight, without the pressure to \u201chave it all figured out.\u201d\nSome stories will be read aloud. Some will simply be witnessed.\nYou are welcome to speak, or just sit and listen.\nWhy this room?\nBecause separation can feel isolating.\nBecause being heard can be healing.\nBecause stories soften shame.\nBecause sometimes, you just need a space where you can exhale.\nWhether you are going through it, supporting someone who is, or reflecting on your own journey \u2014 this evening is an invitation to pause, connect, and remember that you are not alone.\nDate: March 15, 2026\nLocation: Atta Galatta, Bangalore\nDuration: 2 hours",
