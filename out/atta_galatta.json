    "description": "Atta Galatta is delighted to host the launch of Soul Climate, the latest novel by acclaimed writer Inez Baranay. Inventive in form and rich with historical texture, Soul Climate reimagines the idea of India through the perspective of Turkish intellectual and freedom fighter Halide Edib, who visited Delhi in 1935 to deliver a series of lectures.\nThe novel deftly blends fact and fiction. Edib\u2019s encounters with figures of India\u2019s independence movement, including her conversations with Mahatma Gandhi, unfold alongside the fictional journeys of three young women whose lives are shaped by her words. Through these intertwined narratives, Soul Climate explores enduring questions of nationhood, communalism, idealism, and the ties that connect and divide us.\nInez Baranay, author of nine novels, has long been celebrated for her globally engaged and stylistically innovative work. Her earlier books Neem Dreams and With the Tiger were first published in India to critical acclaim.\nThe launch event will be hosted by Bhumika Anand, Founder and Director of the Bangalore Writers Workshop.",

    "name": "My Life Closed Twice - Book Launch by Subhashini Kaligotla",
    "description": "Author Subhashini Kaligotla launches her new poetry collection My Life Closed Twice (Copper Coin, 2025), with Jeet Thayil.\nIn My Life Closed Twice, Subhashini Kaligotla charts the long aftermath of grief, and its recursive, obsessive cadences. Drawing on premodern India\u2019s art, literature, and history, through invented forms and received ones, in fragments, litanies, lists, and queries, the poems in this spare volume embody the psychological terrain of the grieving. Two premature deaths are at the heart of the book. Kaligotla writes of their immediate aftereffects and their enduring impact. She braids her voice with voices from India\u2019s past\u2014from the unknown bards of the Sanskrit epics who counsel equanimity in the face of catastrophe to the laments of Ashoka, Bilhana, and Jahangir.\r\n\u00a0\nAuthor Bio\nSubhashini Kaligotla is a poet and an art historian of ancient and medieval South Asia. She is author of the poetry collection Bird of the Indian Subcontinent and the monograph Shiva\u2019s Waterfront Temples. She teaches at Columbia, dividing her time between New York City and Hyderabad.\r\n\u00a0\nAdvance Praise for My Life Closed Twice\nSubhashini Kaligotla\u2019s ingeniously fashioned poetic structures\u2014which are light, flexible, delicate yet possessed of remarkable tensile strength and architectural clarity and integrity\u2014aren\u2019t just beautiful in themselves. They\u2019re also vessels for deep imaginative feeling and thinking and wondering and longing. She has a unique, compelling lyric voice and a distinguished twenty-first century consciousness.\n- Vijay Seshadri\nAnger, denial, bargaining, despair, all the stages of grief except acceptance, each stage overlaid with the forensic precision generated by love when it has nowhere to go. These enraged, laceratingly plainspoken poems burn with the singular self-awareness that is the writer's curse, and the writer's gift. Two deaths enclose the book like 'two dates // enclosed / by parentheses'. It is impossible to read, say, 'Only Your Brother Will You Lose' \u2013 its fifty shards hammered into the flesh like fifty nine-inch nails \u2013 and come away unscathed.\u00a0\n- Jeet Thayil",

Based on the short story \"Patol Babu- Film Star\" by\u00a0Satyajit Ray.\nRamesh Babu once dreamed of seeing his name on movie posters. Today, he lives a quiet, ordinary life with a dusty ceiling fan and a patient wife. When fate unexpectedly casts him in a film, the world he left behind flickers back to life. Is this his long-awaited moment of recognition\u2014or merely a fleeting illusion?\nSet against the lively chaos of a film shoot and the warmth of home, the play gently reminds us that even the smallest moments can illuminate an entire life.\nBlending humour, nostalgia, and emotional depth, this high energy play,\u00a0The Star\u00a0celebrates rediscovering one\u2019s passion and reminds us that it is never too late to dream again.",

    "description": "Our emotions and memories are intrinsically related to the food we eat and the genre of food literature combines them in a way that helps us connect not only to our past and our present, to different cultures, and communities, values and rituals, events both life-changing and mundane but to each other as well.\u00a0 So, if viewing the world through the lens of food and literature interests you, then join us for a dialogue on \u201cFood in Literature\u201d and to celebrate those stories and their diversity. Each month with Prachi Grover, we read our way through several powerful (and delicious) narratives.\nJanuary Read: In the Beginning there was Bombay Duck by Pronoti Datta\nWe assure you that you will enjoy every single bite! The session is free but registration is a must as we have limited spots available.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPrachi Grover is a culinary consultant and educator and is the founder of \u201cFrom Words to Wok\u201d; a community for people who love to read and eat!\nWhen: Saturday, 31st January, 2026 at 11 a.m.\nWhere: Atta Galatta Bookstore, Indira Nagar\nAges: 18+\nRegistration is mandatory (link in bio)\nCopies of the book are available at the store.",
