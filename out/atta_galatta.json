    "name": "Chaos in a Coupe: Travelling across India with Three Dogs - Book Launch by Divya Dugar",
    "description": "Atta Galatta is delighted to host the launch of Chaos in a Coupe: Travelling across India with Three Dogs by Divya Dugar on 25th Jan at 12:30 PM.\nOnce upon a time, there was a family: Divya Dugar, her partner Olivier, their tiny hooman Marius, and their three rescue streeties\u2014Tigress, Marcopolo and Pari. They lived in Delhi. And they wanted to go to other places.\nSo they booked a first-class coupe with the Indian Railways that allowed them to travel with their dogs. The sixsome went on many, many train journeys. It was not just about getting to a place, be it Goa, Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, but about seeing it with new eyes\u2014and ears and noses, which is inevitable when half your touring party is canine.\nAs they faced uncanny, hilarious situations and tried their best to grapple with systems designed for human convenience, the high point of the trips was often the adventures in the train compartment, which the dogs made their very own.\nA witty, whimsical, wry account of those journeys, accompanied by some stunning photographs, Chaos in a Coupe is a book that travellers, pet parents and anyone who likes a good read will enjoy.\nAbout the Author\nDivya Dugar is a journalist and storyteller with over fifteen years of experience covering news and producing long-form documentaries. Born in Rajasthan and having lived between Kolkata and Delhi, she studied at the Asian College of Journalism before going on to work as a producer on more than sixty reports/documentaries for European broadcasters, primarily ARTE. She also worked as a journalist for four years with France 2.\nHer writing has appeared in numerous publications (including The Book of Dog, edited by Hemali Sodhi and published by HarperCollins) and often draws from her love for animals, heritage architecture, train travel and places off the beaten path. Now based in Southeast Asia, Divya lives with her partner Olivier, their two young children Marius and Elora, and two dogs\u2014Marcopolo and Pari\u2014who are equal parts companions and chaos agents.",

    "description": "In her memoir, Lalita reflects on ageing as something far more layered than simply \u201cgetting old\u201d. She looks at it as a disruption \u2014 a moment when women begin to see themselves differently, take stock of friendships, rethink their roles, and slowly come into who they really are.\nShe asks simple but disarming questions: When do we actually become old? And how is coping with ageing any different from coping with puberty?\nThrough personal stories and observations, Lalita writes about losing estrogen, gaining perspective, building new tribes, and learning to live with bodies that are changing \u2014 with a mix of honesty, curiosity, and humour. For her, ageing becomes both a process of growing up and a kind of liberation.\nJoin us for an intimate reading and conversation around the themes of ageing, identity, and what it means to keep evolving.",

No experience required - just a love for music and connection :)\n\r\nThis time, we're hosting a special, first-of-its-kind workshop! We learn the concepts of vocal harmony, chords, and composing, and then create harmonies together and sing them as a choir - using Hallelujah, by Leonard Cohen, as the base. We'll learn and imbibe concepts like:\n\r\n1. How do I find my vocal range? - terms like basses, baritones, tenors, altos, sopranos, broken down in simple terms, with a bonus lesson in voice modulation\r\n2. What are harmonies and chords? - how multiple different notes blend together, create complexity of emotions with simple changes, the anatomy of a chord\r\n3. How do I assign emotions to notes? - how the emotional spectrum of a scale can be used to create both melody and chords, with the same fundamentals\r\n4. How do I use chords in a song? - for a certain melody, how to choose chords, using overlapping notes with melody, internal progressions, least-change-algorithm, and more\r\n5. How can I visualise music better? - learn some basic exercises to compose and write chords on the fly, and be able to imagine sounds simply in your mind's eye\n\r\nSo come, elevate your skills, and immerse yourselves in the magic of vocal harmony!",

    "description": "Within the Mind Lantern, is a beautifully collection of 41 poems, that has been very well received by the early readers. It is thoughtfully divided into four soul-stirring sections that reads like a gentle walk through memories, emotions, and quiet self-realization. With this poetry collection, the author lights small lanterns within the reader\u2019s mind, guiding them inward. The first section, poems on Nostalgia and Memories, feels like revisiting old photographs, bittersweet, familiar, and deeply comforting. They remind us how memories shape who we are, even when they hurt a little. In the section - Love, Family and Relations, the author captures the beauty of connection, the fragility of bonds, and the unspoken love that often lives between silences. The section on Nature, with gentle metaphors, the poems flow effortlessly, grounding the reader while offering moments of calm and reflection. The final section, Personal Growth and Inspiration, feels like a soft hand on your shoulder, encouraging, reassuring, and deeply empowering. They remind us that growth is personal, nonlinear, and beautifully imperfect. Within the Mind Lantern is not meant to be rushed. It is meant to be felt, revisited, and held close on quiet days. A luminous collection that speaks to the heart, this book is a perfect read if you are looking forward to reconnecting with yourself!\nReaders are invited to meet the author and get their copies signed at Atta Galatta.",

    "description": "People make up big cities but what makes up people\u2019s lives, hopefully not loneliness. Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.\nThis support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.\nThe support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

He will talk about selected stories and engage informally with the audience. Signed copies of the book will be on sale.\n\u00a0\nThe following are sample extracts from reviews on Amazon globally and on Goodreads:\n\u2022 India: \u201cINDISHMAN reminded me of the lyrical beauty of Arundhati Roy, the vivid storytelling of Salman Rushdie, and the magic of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\u201d\n\u2022 UK: \u201cA lovely meander through the vagaries of human nature. Each story warms the heart like a good malt whisky. A very well-written book; I defy anyone not to enjoy it.\u201d\n\u2022 USA: \u201cIt (INDISHMAN) is hard to slot into a specific genre \u2013 the stories, reflections and gentle musings flit from rural Kerala to Nepal, from Southampton to the high seas with ease. They strike the perfect balance between being sharply observed and deeply memorable, yet light enough for an effortlessly enjoyable read, and never without a touch of humour and heart. Without a doubt, this has been the best six dollars and change I\u2019ve spent in a very long time.\u201d",

    "description": "Join us at Atta Galatta for a book discussion with Dena Merriam, author of Sita\u2019s Yoga: The Yoga of Awakening, a reflective and spiritually resonant work that reimagines Sita as a guide for inner transformation.\nIn this book, Dena Merriam explores Sita not only as an avatar of the divine Narayani, but as a compassionate presence in the lives of ordinary people\u2014those navigating family, work, duty, and the search for meaning. Through these encounters, the narrative turns inward, examining the everyday battles we face with anger, greed, fear, arrogance, and indifference. Ravana emerges as a powerful symbol of the forces that pull human consciousness toward materialism and delusion, both in Sita\u2019s time and our own.\nWritten with clarity and depth, Sita\u2019s Yoga: The Yoga of Awakening invites readers to look within, to recognise and transform the shadows of the mind and heart, and to discover how inner awakening becomes the foundation for confronting the challenges of the outer world.\nDate: Sunday, 1 February\nTime: 5:00 PM \u2013 7:00 PM\nVenue: Atta Galatta, Bengaluru",

    "description": "I am so pleased to invite\u00a0interested participants to an inspiring poetry workshop led by internationally published poet and physician\u00a0Dr. Vaishnavi Pusapati. Scheduled for\u00a07th February 2026\u00a0from\u00a02:30 PM to 3:30 PM, the event will explore the art and craft of\u00a0Blackout Poetry and Haiku, inviting participants to creatively reimagine text and discover poetic expression in unexpected places. Blackout is a form of erasure and found poetry where existing text material such as newspaper clippings and journal pages are used as raw material and the phrases that stand out to a poet, are highlighted\u00a0to form a new, often unrelated to the text in meaning, poem. It is a technique used to overcome writer's block as well. Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry focused on attention and detail. In this workshop we will also explore haiku techniques such as the cut word and season word and how to edit your haiku better,\u00a0through examples and worksheet exercises.\nDr. Vaishnavi Pusapati is a distinguished physician-writer whose poetry and micro-fiction have appeared in numerous prestigious literary journals and anthologies around the world. Her work has been featured in publications such as\u00a0Cold Moon Journal,\u00a0Autumn Moon Journal,\u00a0Heron\u2019s Nest Journal,\u00a0Poetry Pea Journal,\u00a0Haikuniverse,\u00a0Under the Bash\u014d, and many others, earning recognition for its lyrical precision and contemplative depth. She is also the winner of the\u00a0Beyond Words\u00a0micro-fiction contest and her haiku have been anthologized in the\u00a0Living Haiku Anthology\u00a0and the\u00a0Haiku Registry. Her haiku book, Afterlife:haikus is forthcoming from Hawakal Publishers. Her creative practice spans haiku, free verse, monostich, and other forms that illuminate the subtle moments of lived experience. Through her work, she invites readers and writers alike to engage deeply with language, memory, and the transformational possibilities of brevity.\nThe\u00a0Blackout Poetry & Haiku Workshop\u00a0will provide attendees with hands-on exercises, guided techniques, and creative prompts designed to nurture individual expression and literary play. Art supplies and refreshments will be provided. Whether you are a seasoned writer or a curious beginner, the session promises to unlock new ways of seeing, connecting and writing.",

    "description": "Join us at Atta Galatta for a book signing with Uttam Kumar Sinha, author of Trial by Water, a timely and incisive exploration of the rivers that lie at the heart of India\u2013Pakistan relations.\nIn this book, Uttam Kumar Sinha traces the turbulent history of the Indus Basin, once a shared lifeline of the subcontinent and later a fractured landscape shaped by Partition, politics, and conflict. Beginning with 1947 and moving through the signing of the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960, the narrative examines how cooperation over water emerged even amidst deep hostility\u2014and why it has remained fragile. With the treaty\u2019s suspension by India in April 2025 following the Pahalgam terror attack, the book asks urgent questions about its future and the possibility of a new, more resilient framework.\nWritten with clarity and analytical depth, Trial by Water looks at the role of political leadership, regional tensions, and global pressures in shaping one of the world\u2019s most significant transboundary water agreements. By following the flow of the Indus rivers, the book offers a powerful lens through which to understand conflict, compromise, and survival in South Asia.\nDate: Tuesday, 10 February\nTime: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM\nVenue: Atta Galatta, Bengaluru",

Elusive, ascetic, fierce, compassionate, and unsettling.\nThis storytelling session for adults explores Shiva\u2019s appearances in the Mahabharata . The session weaves together the many Shivas through multiple lenses like regional retellings, Puranic expansions, classical and folk art, temple narratives, poetry, and oral traditions.",
