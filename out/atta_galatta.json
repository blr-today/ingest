    "description": "Step into the richly woven world of Bebey\u2019s Day Out by Lakshmi C.V, where stories move\nseamlessly across centuries, cities, and states of mind. From the bustling IT hubs of modern\nIndia to the quiet cotton fields of the seventeenth-century Deccan, Lakshmi crafts tales that\nexplore the fragile boundaries between the ordinary and the extraordinary, the real and the\nsupernatural. Each story opens a window into a different world \u2014 one filled with love, loss, guilt,\nand grace.\nPopulated with a memorable cast \u2014 from a spirited old lady to a weary housewife and a\nrestless teenager \u2014 this collection delves into the raw, unguarded emotions that make us\nhuman. Told with insight, warmth, and gentle humour, Bebey\u2019s Day Out is a celebration of life\u2019s\nunpredictability, reminding us that beneath every moment of chaos or calm lies a story waiting to\nbe told.\nAbout the author\nLakshmi C.V. is a writer who delightfully blurs the lines between being a storyteller and a\nhomemaker \u2014 though she\u2019s still deciding which came first. A Physics graduate from IIT with her\nhead often in the clouds but her feet firmly on the ground (also the name of her blog), Lakshmi\nbrings warmth, humour, and heart to everything she writes. Her journey as a writer began early,\nwith her first piece published in Eve\u2019s Weekly while she was still in school.\nHer stories have since appeared in Femina, Woman\u2019s Era, Good Housekeeping, Today,\nWomen\u2019s Web, and Readomania, among others. She has also written books for children and\ncontributed to anthologies like Airavata: Elephant Tales. When not lost in words, Lakshmi can be\nfound teaching, volunteering, or reading \u2014 always finding joy in the journey rather than the\ndestination.\nShe slips in and out of teaching mode without warning. It was quite a relief to her children when\nshe took up assignments as a volunteer with Teach India.\nWhen she is not writing, she is reading for herself, and editing other people\u2019s works.\nFor her, the journey is more interesting than the destination.\nShe lives in the NCR.",

    "name": "An Evening of Survivor & Protest Poetry, Feminism, and Healing - Book Launch by Nishita De",
    "description": "Under the Jackfruit Tree is not just a book \u2014 it is a reclamation. An evening that bridges poetry and protest, music and memory, trauma and tenderness. Join Nish, poet and author of Under the Jackfruit Tree, for a one-hour immersive experience that intertwines survivor poetry, trauma stories, feminist reflections from the 90s, and a heartfelt journey of inner child healing.\nThis evening celebrates the voices that survived, the children who grew up too soon, and the communities that continue to rebuild themselves with love, dissent, and resilience.\nExpect raw spoken word because healing, after all, is incomplete without unconditional love.\nAbout the Book\nUnder the Jackfruit Tree: A Tribute to the Inner Child and a Chorale of Hope\nis an unflinching collection of poems that unearth the layered histories of trauma, inheritance, and healing.\nNish writes with a voice that is both political and personal \u2014 a lyrical rebellion that meditates on the legacies of survival, feminism, and compassion.\nThrough six acts of poetry, the book journeys from childhood rupture to adult repair, culminating in an anthem of hope and defiance \u2014 a manifesto for those who have ever longed for gentleness in a brutal world.\nAbout the Author\nNish is a Survivor and proud Thriver, a poet and community builder devoted to trauma healing, inner child work, and feminist storytelling.\nShe is also a tech product leader by profession, living in Bengaluru with her partner of 15 years and two beloved Indies.\nWriting under her poetic identity Gargle in Grey, Nish believes in the power of a conscious community and the refusal of binaries \u2014 in life, love, and art.\nThis launch isn\u2019t merely a literary event \u2014 it\u2019s a\u00a0social movement through verse.\nEach reading becomes a protest, each poem a reclamation of language and tenderness from the jaws of trauma.\n\u201cThrough my poems,\u201d Nish says, \u201cI speak to the ones who have survived in silence. This book is an ode to them \u2014 and to the children we once were, who kept us alive.",
