    "description": "History isn\u2019t just a record of the past \u2014 it\u2019s an adventure waiting to be discovered.\nHow do you turn the past into something that feels urgent, immersive, and impossible to put down? The Bold Chronicles,\u00a0a new historical-fiction series by Sarita Mandanna for middle-grade and older readers, begins with a simple belief: that history is not a dusty account, but a living, breathing story.\nPublished by Aleph Book Company, the series spans 2,500 years of India\u2019s vast and layered past. Each book plunges readers into a completely different world \u2014 from ancient battlefields and spies moving through Alexander\u2019s invading armies, to scientists racing against time in India\u2019s space programme. Every title is a standalone adventure, allowing readers to jump into any point in history. At the centre of each story is an unlikely young hero or heroine, thrust into events far larger than themselves, where quick thinking, courage, and determination matter just as much as the forces shaping history.\nThe First Adventures:\nThe War Elephants of Trigarta\u00a0is set on the eve of Alexander the Great\u2019s advance into India. Mili, the daughter of a respected general, forms an unbreakable bond with Nathu, a rare white elephant. As empires collide and the Battle of Hydaspes between Alexander and Porus looms, Mili is drawn into a world of danger, strategy, and survival \u2014 where the fate of a kingdom may rest on her resolve.\nSecrets Among the Stars\u00a0leaps into contemporary India. Arya\u2019s quiet summer with a secretive great-uncle \u2014 a brilliant former ISRO scientist \u2014 takes a sharp turn when a mysterious poem from the past resurfaces. What begins as a puzzle soon becomes a race against time, linking ancient ideas to modern science, and uncovering a secret that stretches from India\u2019s earliest histories to the frontiers of space.\nTogether, the books in The Bold Chronicles offer a perfect blend of momentum, wonder, and discovery. It is a series that invites middle-grade and older readers to step across the centuries \u2014 and discover that the past is closer, richer, and more exciting than they ever imagined.\nAbout Author:\nSarita Mandanna is an author of literary fiction. Her debut novel Tiger Hills was translated into fourteen languages worldwide and longlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize. Represented by David Godwin, she is a graduate of the Wharton Business School and the Indian Institute of Management. She is a private equity investor, and lives in Toronto with her husband and son.",

As his career hangs in the balance and political ambitions close to him are threatened, the novel traces a reckoning with the past, forcing its characters to confront desire, power, love, and moral responsibility.\nThrough sharp satire and emotional depth, Kaayaa explores contemporary themes of sexuality, disease, marriage, and politics, while questioning society\u2019s obsession with appearance and perfection. The novel lays bare characters caught between their real and imagined selves, each chasing a version of the American dream, only to discover its costs.\nA searing and honest meditation on beauty, ambition, and the human condition, Kaayaa reaffirms Guruprasad Kaginele\u2019s voice as one of the most compelling in contemporary Kannada literature.",

    "description": "BECAUSE GOOD GIRLS DON\u2019T CHANGE THE WORLD. For every woman who has been told she's \"too much,\" this is a memoir about becoming exactly who you're meant to be.\nSangeeta Pillai was called a \"Bad Daughter\" for defying the rigid expectations placed on \"good Indian girls.\" But in her rebellion, she found her voice. From a harrowing childhood in a Mumbai slum-haunted by a violent father and the brutal murder of her mother-this is a story of resilience. With a fire in her belly, she\nbattled patriarchy, chased her dreams, and built a new life in London, creating a successful podcast to inspire other women. Yet, all her success couldn't outrun the past. Faced with debilitating mental health, she explored many healing avenues from psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, EMDR, acupuncture to Tantra. But to truly heal, she had to go back to her birthplace: tropical Kerala to confront her deep trauma. There, she experienced the most profound spiritual transformation in Kerala's ancient temples. Sangeeta's powerful, spiritual and deeply inspiring journey shows us that healing means finding your way back home to yourself. Bad Daughter is an inspirational feminist memoir for every woman who wants to break free. Ultimately, it's a reminder that the courage to be your authentic self can transform your own life - and the lives of those around you.\nAuthor Description:\nSangeeta Pillai grew up in a Mumbai slum. Today, she is recognised as a leading voice for South Asian feminism globally. Award-winning podcaster, writer and feminist activist, Sangeeta is the creator of Masala Podcast (all about cultural taboos) which won 6 British Podcast Awards, 1 Audio Production Award & Spotify SoundUp 2018 award. She's also the founder of South Asian feminist network Soul Sutras. Sangeeta has been featured extensively in the press from BBC Radio, Guardian, Metro, Cosmopolitan, Evening Standard, Stylist, Eastern Eye to Huffington Post. As well as on giant billboards in New York, London, Dublin, Cardiff & Glasgow. She is also the creator of the Masala Monologues series of writing workshops & theatre shows in the UK & the US. Sangeeta is a regular speaker at WOW Festival, Podcast Show London, Shameless Festival, Primadonna Festival as well as being a regular speaker on innumerable panels and podcasts.",

His work appears in numerous print and online platforms. This is his second book of poems.\nBabitha Marina Justin is a writer and visual artist who moves easily between a paintbrush and a pen. Her poetry lingers on memory, gender, and the small intimacies of everyday life, with a voice that can be tender one moment and uncompromising the next. She has written nine books, including three poetry collections, Of Fireflies, Guns and the Hills (2015), I Cook My Own Feast (2019), and Forty-Five Shades of Brown (2023). She also co-edited salt, pepper and silver linings: celebrating our grandmothers (2019), a tribute to resilience and inheritance.\nSalini Vineeth is a fiction writer and translator. She worked as an engineer for ten years before moving to full-time writing in 2019. Since then, she has published five books \u2014 Lost Edges (novel, 2023), Magic Square (novella, 2020), Everyday People (short story collection, 2019), and travel guides for Hampi and Badami.

She looks at it as a disruption \u2014 a moment when women begin to see themselves differently, take stock of friendships, rethink their roles, and slowly come into who they really are.\nShe asks simple but disarming questions: When do we actually become old? And how is coping with ageing any different from coping with puberty?\nThrough personal stories and observations, Lalita writes about losing estrogen, gaining perspective, building new tribes, and learning to live with bodies that are changing \u2014 with a mix of honesty, curiosity, and humour. For her, ageing becomes both a process of growing up and a kind of liberation.\nJoin us for an intimate reading and conversation around the themes of ageing, identity, and what it means to keep evolving.",

Signed copies of the book will be on sale.\n\u00a0\nThe following are sample extracts from reviews on Amazon globally and on Goodreads:\n\u2022 India: \u201cINDISHMAN reminded me of the lyrical beauty of Arundhati Roy, the vivid storytelling of Salman Rushdie, and the magic of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\u201d\n\u2022 UK: \u201cA lovely meander through the vagaries of human nature. Each story warms the heart like a good malt whisky. A very well-written book; I defy anyone not to enjoy it.\u201d\n\u2022 USA: \u201cIt (INDISHMAN) is hard to slot into a specific genre \u2013 the stories, reflections and gentle musings flit from rural Kerala to Nepal, from Southampton to the high seas with ease. They strike the perfect balance between being sharply observed and deeply memorable, yet light enough for an effortlessly enjoyable read, and never without a touch of humour and heart.
