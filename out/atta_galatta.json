    "description": "About the play \"Vrindaban, Present Please\" is an immersive, one-man interactive play set in a rural Indian village, where Samiran Banerjee, a Kolkata teacher, is transferred to a village school after a Supreme Court ruling. Assigned to a chaotic school once led by the mysteriously absent Salma Khatoon, Samiran's efforts to restore order only lead him deeper into unsettling events. From a water shortage to a snake in his room, his attempts to connect with the eccentric villagers only intensify his isolation. But behind it all, Samiran harbors a secret\u2014someone named Vrindaban. Why does he hide this figure? Is it the only refuge in a world that refuses to understand him? The play unravels questions about isolation, hidden truths, and the blurred lines between personal and professional life.\nAbout the artist:\u00a0 Somudranil Sarkar, a theatre maker from kolkata. He has over 25 years of experience in theatre and has had the privilege of training under some of the most respected names in the Bengali theatre circuit, including Rudraprasad Sengupta, Swatilekha Sengupta, Debshankar Halder, Sohini Sengupta, and Goutam Halder in Nandikar.
