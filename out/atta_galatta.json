    "description": "Join us for a curated storytelling evening - Weaving a story (A curated exploration of Khadi Textiles). Whether you're a lover of textiles, history, or just fascinated by Indian heritage, this event will wrap you in the magic of tradition.\nThis event is organized in partnership with Metaphor Racha, an initiative to honour the people and process behind Khadi.\nAbout Ravi Kiran: \nAfter graduating from Karnataka University with a degree in electronics in 1993, Ravi Kiran chose to work in textiles/garments. For the next four years, he worked in a few garment factories and realized his true calling was more towards handcrafted textiles and made-ups. Keeping this in mind, in 1997, he started a company called 'Barometre'. Though he was not trained in textile and garment construction, having a workshop provided him with the opportunity to learn everything hands-on.\nIn 2010, he formed Metaphor Racha with a clear understanding of working with the Khadi value chain, be it spinners, weavers, dyers, printers, or tailors, and bringing deserving craftspeople to the forefront. He strongly advocates transparency in business, fair prices, pride in labour, and equal opportunity for growth for everyone involved. He considers himself fortunate to have worked with various Khadi cooperatives in Karnataka and tries to be the bridge between rural crafts and urban needs.\nAbout Aparna:\nAparna Jaishankar is a Storyteller, Educator and Corporate Trainer.\nAparna\u2019s passion lies in exploring Indic Mythology with a contemporary lens. She enjoys the various versions of these stories found in the nooks and crannies of the Indian subcontinent in the form of songs, theatre, dance, weaving, rituals and practices. She incorporates these rich sources in her Storytelling performances.",
