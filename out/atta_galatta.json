    "description": "The Qu for Quiz is based on a grid format with the grids formed by topics on one axis and level of difficulty (and hence the points) on the other. The topics could be varied like History, Sports, Music, Literature, Movies and more. A team of two members would get to choose a topic and the level of difficulty and the question would be revealed. The rest of the teams can go for the buzzer if they know the answer. Depending on the number\u00a0of teams registering, the size of the grid would be decided.\u00a0\nSAMPLE Qu: 2. The name is inspired by the traditional malt whisky distillation process in which malted barley was mixed by hand with shovels. This labor-intensive process often caused a shoulder injury to workers, causing their arms to hang low. Which brand is named thus?\nGanesh Balakrishnan is an entrepreneur, marketer and creator of terrible dad jokes.

TechnoCats follows 7 students over 7 years, chasing success in a high-stakes environment where winner takes all. Layered with the perspective of an IIT alumnus from 35 years ago, the film paints a portrait of an institution that shapes not just careers, but identities and futures.\nThis is an opportunity to see the film in its rough-cut stage. We\u2019re looking for fresh perspectives\u2014your feedback will help shape the final version. We\u2019re also seeking support to complete the film, whether through funding, studio time, or connections that can help bring TechnoCats to a wider audience.\nYour presence, thoughts, and support\u2014of any kind\u2014would mean a lot to us. Looking forward to sharing this journey with you!\nGautam Sonti is an independent documentary filmmaker, who attempts to unearth stories that are hidden below the surface. Whether it\u2019s the subversion of democracy in a city government, the absurdity of food politics in the country, or the narrowing of young minds in our educational system, his films quietly capture life as it unfolds.\u00a0 They don\u2019t shout for attention, but invite audiences to pause, observe, and reconsider their positions. You can find out more about his work at gautamsonti.com\nOver the last 4 decades or so, Tara Rao graduated from being an architect to working on climate justice and human rights with various organisations, including Amnesty and WWF in Asia, Africa and Europe. As a campaigner though, the visual side of communication became more critical and exciting for her. That experience served her well when she led GoodPitch Karnataka - a process involving multiple people and initiatives shaping impactful communication through film to further a cause. Today the richness of possibilities and the deepening challenges keep her on her toes and buzzing.\u00a0 www.ourgroundworks.org",
