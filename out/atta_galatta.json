Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every wake of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.\nThis support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.\nThe support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore.This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",
