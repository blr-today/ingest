In her unique voice and andaz, she produced such hauntingly sweet notes, coupled with her spontaneity, that the audience were immediately captivated. Beginning at the age of Seven, Begum Akhtar kept her audience spellbound for almost six decades.\nThis was Begum Akhtar, the Singer; but her personal journey is equally captivating and inspiring. She was a brave, fiercely independent-minded person, who drew her life path herself amidst the struggles that life threw at her. At a time when the social and political landscape of the country was gradually changing, she set her own standards of life and arts, not withstanding the constraints of times and emerged as a stronger person and better singer by living upto those standards.\nWith all its highs and lows and awws and wows, Dastan-e-Akhtari is the story of the life of the legend of her time and beyond, Begum Akhtar. In this performance, the story of her life will be told by Kafeel Jafri \u2013 a Dastango (\u2018storyteller\u2019 in Urdu), interspersed with rendition of her songs \u2013 Ghazals & Thumris by Yusra Naqvi, a trained Hindustani Classical Singer.",
