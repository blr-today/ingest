    "description": "The Qu for Quiz is based on a grid format with the grids formed by topics on one axis and level of difficulty (and hence the points) on the other. The topics could be varied like History, Sports, Music, Literature, Movies and more. A team of two members would get to choose a topic and the level of difficulty and the question would be revealed. The rest of the teams can go for the buzzer if they know the answer. Depending on the number\u00a0of teams registering, the size of the grid would be decided.\u00a0\nSAMPLE Qu: 2. The name is inspired by the traditional malt whisky distillation process in which malted barley was mixed by hand with shovels. This labor-intensive process often caused a shoulder injury to workers, causing their arms to hang low. Which brand is named thus?\u00a0\nGanesh Balakrishnan is an entrepreneur, marketer and creator of terrible dad jokes.

    "description": "Atta Galatta is delighted to host the launch of Kaayaa, the Kannada novel by acclaimed writer Guruprasad Kaginele, on 17th January, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM.\nSet largely in the United States, Kaayaa (which translates to Body) follows the life of Dr Bheem Malik, one of Manhattan\u2019s most sought-after plastic surgeons, whose professional and personal worlds begin to unravel when his name surfaces in a MeToo scandal. As his career hangs in the balance and political ambitions close to him are threatened, the novel traces a reckoning with the past, forcing its characters to confront desire, power, love, and moral responsibility.\nThrough sharp satire and emotional depth, Kaayaa explores contemporary themes of sexuality, disease, marriage, and politics, while questioning society\u2019s obsession with appearance and perfection. The novel lays bare characters caught between their real and imagined selves, each chasing a version of the American dream, only to discover its costs.\nA searing and honest meditation on beauty, ambition, and the human condition, Kaayaa reaffirms Guruprasad Kaginele\u2019s voice as one of the most compelling in contemporary Kannada literature.",

    "name": "Bad Daughter Book Salon - Book Discussion by Sangeeta Pillai",
    "description": "BECAUSE GOOD GIRLS DON\u2019T CHANGE THE WORLD. For every woman who has been told she's \"too much,\" this is a memoir about becoming exactly who you're meant to be.\nSangeeta Pillai was called a \"Bad Daughter\" for defying the rigid expectations placed on \"good Indian girls.\" But in her rebellion, she found her voice. From a harrowing childhood in a Mumbai slum-haunted by a violent father and the brutal murder of her mother-this is a story of resilience. With a fire in her belly, she\nbattled patriarchy, chased her dreams, and built a new life in London, creating a successful podcast to inspire other women. Yet, all her success couldn't outrun the past. Faced with debilitating mental health, she explored many healing avenues from psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, EMDR, acupuncture to Tantra. But to truly heal, she had to go back to her birthplace: tropical Kerala to confront her deep trauma. There, she experienced the most profound spiritual transformation in Kerala's ancient temples. Sangeeta's powerful, spiritual and deeply inspiring journey shows us that healing means finding your way back home to yourself. Bad Daughter is an inspirational feminist memoir for every woman who wants to break free. Ultimately, it's a reminder that the courage to be your authentic self can transform your own life - and the lives of those around you.\nAuthor Description:\nSangeeta Pillai grew up in a Mumbai slum. Today, she is recognised as a leading voice for South Asian feminism globally. Award-winning podcaster, writer and feminist activist, Sangeeta is the creator of Masala Podcast (all about cultural taboos) which won 6 British Podcast Awards, 1 Audio Production Award & Spotify SoundUp 2018 award. She's also the founder of South Asian feminist network Soul Sutras. Sangeeta has been featured extensively in the press from BBC Radio, Guardian, Metro, Cosmopolitan, Evening Standard, Stylist, Eastern Eye to Huffington Post. As well as on giant billboards in New York, London, Dublin, Cardiff & Glasgow. She is also the creator of the Masala Monologues series of writing workshops & theatre shows in the UK & the US. Sangeeta is a regular speaker at WOW Festival, Podcast Show London, Shameless Festival, Primadonna Festival as well as being a regular speaker on innumerable panels and podcasts.",

She looks at it as a disruption \u2014 a moment when women begin to see themselves differently, take stock of friendships, rethink their roles, and slowly come into who they really are.\nShe asks simple but disarming questions: When do we actually become old? And how is coping with ageing any different from coping with puberty?\nThrough personal stories and observations, Lalita writes about losing estrogen, gaining perspective, building new tribes, and learning to live with bodies that are changing \u2014 with a mix of honesty, curiosity, and humour. For her, ageing becomes both a process of growing up and a kind of liberation.\nJoin us for an intimate reading and conversation around the themes of ageing, identity, and what it means to keep evolving.",

Each story warms the heart like a good malt whisky. A very well-written book; I defy anyone not to enjoy it.\u201d\n\u2022 USA: \u201cIt (INDISHMAN) is hard to slot into a specific genre \u2013 the stories, reflections and gentle musings flit from rural Kerala to Nepal, from Southampton to the high seas with ease. They strike the perfect balance between being sharply observed and deeply memorable, yet light enough for an effortlessly enjoyable read, and never without a touch of humour and heart.
