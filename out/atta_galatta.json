The individual and different life journeys of both characters find crossroads in hope and acceptance, in this 'Coming of age' themed story.\nThe film came alive as a Residency project curated at the Forge by LevelUp Learning, the world's first creative residency bootcamp for filmmakers. The project is also a tribute to every stranger the filmmaker has met in her own life as they smiled back, patted her back, exchanged a poem or a note, offered a hug, shared stories, and, were kind in the brief time spent together. Each, in their own heartwarming way, have been an inspiration in action. And this film, therefore, is a 'Gratitude Note'.\nThe film especially acknowledges and celebrates the Indigo Airlines and their conscious, generous efforts towards Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. A personal heartwarming incident with one of the Indigo Ground Crew at the Chennai Airport has inspired the character arc of one of the protagonists of the film.\nStory, Script & Direction: Asambhava Shubha\nAssistant Direction: Gautham Krishna\nCast: Ajith Prasad, Gautham Krishna, Asambhava Shubha\nMusic: Saurabh Tripathi\nDOP: Mahesh MSP\nEditing: Mahesh MSP & Dhanvignesh Aamuri\nSound Design & Mix: Dhanvignesh Aamuri\nCurated at: The Forge by LevelUp Learning\nLocation: Jaipur(Rajasthan), India",
