    "description": "9 improvisers take over the stage without any script. A few prompts from the audience are all that they want. Can they make things funny? Can they even come up with a story? They have 1.5 hours to prove.\nWhat is improv?\nImprov is not a play, there\u2019s no script. It is also not standup, there are no tried and tested jokes. It is somewhere in between these two things. You\u2019ll have to come to find out!\nWhy should you attend?\n\nYou are part of the script - your prompts will decide where the show will go\nYou can bring a date for a cool show\nYou can tell your Instagram friends that you attended a cool show",
