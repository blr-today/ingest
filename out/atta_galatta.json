    "description": "Bangalore!\nWe are bringing you the Dalit feminist writer and Instagram-famous poet Aleena all the way from Kochi for evening of poetry and conversation.\nIf you haven't already been following her spoken word poetry reels and detailed analysis of caste and culture that tends to piss off people at the top of the oppression pyramid, then you're missing out. Aleena is the author of Silk Route (2021), a collection of 91 Malayalam poems that explores horror, politics, mythology, colourism, mythology, gender, and caste. She was awarded the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Kanakashree Award in 2022, but more importantly, Aleena\u2019s poetry is an unabashed, inimitable love song to her lived and observed realities; her work is a magnificent, reckless laugh in the face of a society that makes absurdly clumsy attempts to stifle freedom and the agency of marginalised women.\n\u2728 Join us for an intimate evening on Wednesday the 23rd from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM, as Aleena reads her English poetry and sits down for a powerful, honest conversation with Rheea Mukherjee (author of The Body Myth (2019) and The Girl Who Kept Falling in Love (2023) and an outspoken advocate for mental health, social equity, and emotional truth) exploring Aleena's observations of the absurdities of caste, class, gender, religion, and the everyday magic of resistance.\n\ud83c\udfa4 The evening will close with a Q&A session, giving the audience a chance to connect, reflect, and engage.\n\ud83e\udde1 This is a safe space for expression, listening, and community.\nWe do not tolerate any form of discrimination based on caste, gender, sexuality, religion, class, disability, or neurodivergence. Anyone engaging in hateful, harmful, or disrespectful behaviour will be asked to leave. No debate. No discussion. Marginalised voices are at the centre of this gathering \u2014 come with care or don\u2019t come at all.",

    "description": "What if you were told nonsense isn't random. From manufactured outrage in news cycles to advertising's linguistic sleight of hand, from legal documents that read like absurdist theater to TikTok trends that defy explanation\u2014these seemingly meaningless fragments are quietly but constantly reshaping our reality. What if the cultural static you mindlessly scroll past \u2013 viral dance trends, reality TV drama, and daily soap dialogues that make you cringe \u2013 isn\u2019t really mindless and impacts your life? This is your chance to find out how. Decide hidden architecture of language and images that slips between logic's cracks constructing your worlds.\nThis workshop is an intellectual excavation. We'll dissect the patterns lurking beneath the surface of cultural absurdity, using critical tools to understand how meaning is constructed, manipulated, and occasionally demolished. It's an invitation to think differently: to see the elegance in the profoundly ridiculous.\nWho Should Attend? \nCurious minds who consume media critically, who love intellectual provocations, and who believe that understanding our world requires looking beyond the obvious. Led by a cultural critic who knows that serious thinking can\u2014and should\u2014be playful, irreverent, and ridiculously insightful.\n\u00a0\nAastha D. is a writer, critic, and educator working at the intersections of art, architecture, design, and cultural theory. She writes for publications such as wallpaper*, Metropolis, The Hindu, Architectural Digest, and Tribune UK, and has worked with leading artists, designers, and institutions to craft narratives that push boundaries and provoke thought. Aastha holds a graduate degree from Columbia University, where she specialized in critical theory and built environments.\nShe is the founder of Proseterity, an independent publication on art, culture, and criticism, where she also runs Critiqala, its education vertical. Through workshops on critical thinking, media, and design, she creates spaces for deep inquiry and playful experimentation, helping participants sharpen perception and challenge dominant narratives.\nAt the core of her work is an obsession with how culture is constructed, how power is embedded in space and image, and how we can rethink the systems that shape our world.\nTo apply for a scholarship to attend this workshop, please fill out this form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNQRriWNRMsWb0MeASu65lsTUqnNku6RW-KxVUY6Zi4u6-QQ/viewform",

In this book, a flock of flamingos flies south in search of food and drink. What they find in the water causes a hullabaloo\u2026 They get draped and decked in unspooled tape, rubber tyres, shoes, plastic bags, syringe-needles, even rear-view mirrors! Unaware of their doom, they break into a dance in a confused trance.\nPriya Kuriyan brings the irony alive through stunning visuals. Real objects imaginatively placed together with her drawings create a lifelike three-dimensional effect. Along with Devashish Makhija\u2019s brilliant verse soaked in satire, they paint a telling picture \u2013 of the violence unthinking humans inflict on the natural world through hazardous waste.\nAbout the Illustrator\nPriya Kuriyan is a children's book writer-illustrator, comics maker and chronic doodler. She has directed educational films for the Sesame Street show (India) and the Children's Film Society of India (CFSI) and has illustrated numerous children's books for publishers like Tulika Books, Penguin, Scholastic and Hachette to name a few.

    "description": "How does the content you consume shape your thoughts, decisions, and behavior?\r\nAre you curious about the\u00a0root causes\u00a0of human behavior?\r\nDo you want the freedom to\u00a0challenge every statement\u00a0and engage in an open discussion?\r\nLooking for\u00a0unbiased answers\u00a0to your toughest questions?\nJoin us for an\u00a0interactive Q&A-based session\u00a0that encourages\u00a0critical thinking and questioning!\nThis session is part of\u00a0#MyConsumptionMyResponsibility, an initiative by\u00a0Simon\u00a0Jakkam\u00a0aimed at raising awareness about how information, media, and content consumption profoundly impact our\u00a0thoughts, behaviors, and overall well-being\u2014especially among young minds.\nWhat Makes This Session Unique?\n\u2705\u00a0100% Q&A-based:\u00a0No lectures\u2014only real discussions! I\u2019ll answer questions directly from the audience.\r\n\u2705\u00a0Challenge My Answers:\u00a0You can counter-question every statement I make until you're\u00a0completely satisfied\u00a0with the response.\r\n\u2705\u00a0Root-Cause Analysis:\u00a0My responses will go beyond surface-level explanations and focus on\u00a0why\u00a0things happen the way they do.\nWhy Is This Important?\nWith digital consumption at an all-time high, even\u00a0young children\u00a0are exposed to unfiltered content that shapes their thinking and behavior\u2014often without them realizing it.\u00a0They cannot filter what\u2019s right or wrong.\u00a0This makes mindful consumption\u00a0a necessity, not a choice.\u00a0Understanding its impact is the\u00a0need of the hour\u00a0as it influences every aspect of life.\nCome, challenge, question, and discover\u00a0how mindful consumption can transform your life!",
