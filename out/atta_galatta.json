    "description": "The play - Noor is a reconstruction of the story of Noor Inayat Khan, a direct descendant of Tipu Sultan, who served in Britain\u2019s Special Operations during World War II. It is an extraordinary tale of devotion to duty, resilience in the face of Nazi oppression in France. A fascinating life of a woman who defied all labels in her own quiet way - daughter of a Sufi pacifist who joined the war yet didn`t want to kill anyone, an Indian origin woman who served a country that colonised India, a demure looking woman with extraordinary inner strength. Her story is brought to life as a \u2018Courtyard Theatre\u2019 production, a format developed by BLT. A team of two actors who play different characters with very minimal props and sets, lights and sounds.",
