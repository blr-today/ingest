And at the Great Eastern, Calcutta's most luxurious hotel, amidst the feasting, dancing and laughter, we witness the metropolis in the last moments before multiple disasters strike.\nThe story begins in August 1941, on the day Rabindranath Tagore dies. The city has come to a standstill as thousands of people line the streets to pay their respects. Among them are: Nirupama, a student of history and a volunteer with the Communist Party of India; Imogen, a young Englishwoman whose father is an official with the Raj; Kedar, the scion of a wealthy family, who dreams of painting like Cezanne; and Gopal, a young but experienced pickpocket, who finds himself promoted into a dark, dangerous world.\nTheir lives intertwine with those at the hotel: an American soldier who plays jazz at the nightclub; a genius French chef; an heiress fleeing from the nightmare in Europe; and a group of military officers running a secret intelligence operation.\nSingularly ambitious and attentive, Ruchir Joshi's\u00a0Great Eastern Hotel\u00a0maps this simmering pause at a crucial juncture in history, and offers new contexts to the upheavals of our present, raising vital questions about political commitment, nationalism, love and art.\nJoin us for a session with the author on 16th February, where he will be reading from portions of his book and signing copies.",

The choice of colours, mood and theme, sensory and emotional experience while painting gets influenced by the presence of sound and music in the environment where art is taking place impacting the artistic process and the final creation.\nInspired by this, we have a similar collaboration with artists Shilpi, Ayuushi, Priyanka and Khusbu who aspire to hold a Sound & Art Workshop for women wishing to experience such intense joy and creativity on 8th March 2025, International Women\u2019s Day.\nIt would be a treat to observe the participants flow with the sounds and express their art.\nTake away:\nPainting to add vibrancy to your room or your living.

    "name": "Love Stories from Indian Heritage - Storytelling",
    "description": "Love stories aren\u2019t only about the hero and heroine for love can rarely exist in isolation. Zealous messengers, art and music as mood enhancers, food as aphrodisiacs, taboos and mores \u2013 all play a pivotal role in shaping stories of love. Vikram Sridhar and Aparna Jaishankar rummage through the passages of time to bring you various hues of love etched in our heritage through literature, architecture, songs and poetry through the all- encompassing art form of oral storytelling.\nAbout Aparna Jaishankar\nAparna Jaishankar is a Storyteller with a penchant for Indic mythology. She believes that there is no ONE version of any story. Her storytelling performances take a contemporary view of ancient tales. Aparna also works with educators in developing learning perspectives in the classroom and with organisations in building internal narratives.\nAbout Vikram Sridhar \nVikram Sridhar is a Performance Storyteller and theatre practitioner who believes in Storytelling as a strong medium for Conservation and Conversation, which is highly relevant in the modern context. Vikram combines his work and interest in Theatre, Social Work, and Conservation in his Storytelling and has performed for audience of various age groups across India.",
