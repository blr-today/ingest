    "description": "I am so pleased to invite\u00a0interested participants to an inspiring poetry workshop led by internationally published poet and physician\u00a0Dr. Vaishnavi Pusapati. Scheduled for\u00a07th February 2026\u00a0from\u00a02:30 PM to 3:30 PM, the event will explore the art and craft of\u00a0Blackout Poetry and Haiku, inviting participants to creatively reimagine text and discover poetic expression in unexpected places. Blackout is a form of erasure and found poetry where existing text material such as newspaper clippings and journal pages are used as raw material and the phrases that stand out to a poet, are highlighted\u00a0to form a new, often unrelated to the text in meaning, poem. It is a technique used to overcome writer's block as well. Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry focused on attention and detail. In this workshop we will also explore haiku techniques such as the cut word and season word and how to edit your haiku better,\u00a0through examples and worksheet exercises.\nDr. Vaishnavi Pusapati is a distinguished physician-writer whose poetry and micro-fiction have appeared in numerous prestigious literary journals and anthologies around the world. Her work has been featured in publications such as\u00a0Cold Moon Journal,\u00a0Autumn Moon Journal,\u00a0Heron\u2019s Nest Journal,\u00a0Poetry Pea Journal,\u00a0Haikuniverse,\u00a0Under the Bash\u014d, and many others, earning recognition for its lyrical precision and contemplative depth. She is also the winner of the\u00a0Beyond Words\u00a0micro-fiction contest and her haiku have been anthologized in the\u00a0Living Haiku Anthology\u00a0and the\u00a0Haiku Registry. Her haiku book, Afterlife:haikus is forthcoming from Hawakal Publishers. Her creative practice spans haiku, free verse, monostich, and other forms that illuminate the subtle moments of lived experience. Through her work, she invites readers and writers alike to engage deeply with language, memory, and the transformational possibilities of brevity.\nThe\u00a0Blackout Poetry & Haiku Workshop\u00a0will provide attendees with hands-on exercises, guided techniques, and creative prompts designed to nurture individual expression and literary play. Art supplies and refreshments will be provided. Whether you are a seasoned writer or a curious beginner, the session promises to unlock new ways of seeing, connecting and writing.",

Beginning with 1947 and moving through the signing of the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960, the narrative examines how cooperation over water emerged even amidst deep hostility\u2014and why it has remained fragile. With the treaty\u2019s suspension by India in April 2025 following the Pahalgam terror attack, the book asks urgent questions about its future and the possibility of a new, more resilient framework.\nWritten with clarity and analytical depth, Trial by Water looks at the role of political leadership, regional tensions, and global pressures in shaping one of the world\u2019s most significant transboundary water agreements. By following the flow of the Indus rivers, the book offers a powerful lens through which to understand conflict, compromise, and survival in South Asia.\nDate: Tuesday, 10 February\nTime: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM\nVenue: Atta Galatta, Bengaluru",
