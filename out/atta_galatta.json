    "name": "Liberate Through Lavani - Lecture",
    "description": "Join us for an insightful session that offers a glimpse into the lives of traditional Lavani artists from matriarchal communities. Through an engaging audio-visual presentation, we'll explore the significance of Lavani in modern times, highlighting its themes of love and liberation.\nBhushan has been engaging with Lavani artists since 2002, which led him to write his award-winning book \u2018Sangeet Bari\u2019 in 2014. Based on this book, he created the much-acclaimed show \u2018Sangeet Bari\u2019 \u2018Lavani Ke Rang\u2019, \u2018Love & Lavani\u2019, and \u2018Kahin Pyar Ho Na Jaaen\u2019. He has written Lavani and other songs for music videos produced by \u2018Agents of Ishq\u2019. Bhushan also writes fiction that primarily deals with sexuality and crime. His stories on the \u2018Storytel\u2019 app are widely popular, as are his periodic features in \u2018Loksatta\u2019 and \u2018Mint Lounge' where he chronicles his relationship with unique cuisines. Bhushan has recently translated Shahu Patole\u2019s Marathi book \u2018Dalit Kitchens of Marathwada\u2019 into English.\u00a0\u00a0 (You can rephrase this bio for the workshop - where it will start with my work about eroticas)\nB Spot Productions creates performances that enable communities to share their stories, facilitate the audience to explore sensory pleasures and initiate conversations on taboo topics. They also conduct Lavani workshops, writing workshops, food trails and culture trails. The group is founded by Mumbai based writer Bhushan Korgaonkar with a team of multi-disciplinary collaborators including Geetanjali Kulkarni, Kunal Vijayakar, Anita Date, Reshma Shetty, Wasimbarry Maner and others who create these stories of love & desire, crime & thrill, humour & hope.",

But is it only a story of man against man, of land lost and won through dice and battle?\nLook closer.\nThe forests, rivers, trees, and all living beings breathe within the epic - sometimes as silent witnesses, sometimes as powerful protagonists.\nThey stand in plain sight in the well-known narratives and thrive richly in the subaltern traditions. These tales are kept alive through rituals, sculptures, folklore, and ancient performing arts.\nJoin us for an evocative hour of oral storytelling as we travel through dense forests, along deep rivers, and across battered battlefields; guided not by warriors, but by the living earth herself.",

Stepping out from the medically induced com(m)a into a full stop sounds too appealing.\nWill Spencer give in to his fears or give being alive another chance?\nJoin us for the launch of When Stars Fell into My Soup, full of stories, conversations, good vibes, and some great coffee and snacks as well!\nPuneet Gupta is your classic techie-turned-storyteller\u2014only with a few unexpected plot twists and detours along the way.
