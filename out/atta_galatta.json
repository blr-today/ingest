Beginning with 1947 and moving through the signing of the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960, the narrative examines how cooperation over water emerged even amidst deep hostility\u2014and why it has remained fragile. With the treaty\u2019s suspension by India in April 2025 following the Pahalgam terror attack, the book asks urgent questions about its future and the possibility of a new, more resilient framework.\nWritten with clarity and analytical depth, Trial by Water looks at the role of political leadership, regional tensions, and global pressures in shaping one of the world\u2019s most significant transboundary water agreements. By following the flow of the Indus rivers, the book offers a powerful lens through which to understand conflict, compromise, and survival in South Asia.\nDate: Tuesday, 10 February\nTime: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM\nVenue: Atta Galatta, Bengaluru",

    "description": "Join us at Atta Galatta for a book signing with Raghavan Srinivasan for Rebellion in Verse, a richly researched and evocative exploration of the Tamil Bhakti movement that emerged in the sixth century CE. At a time when many sought relief from Vedic orthodoxy, rigid ritual, and entrenched caste hierarchies, the movement offered a radically different spiritual vision rooted in personal devotion and social equality.\nThrough the hymns of saint-poets such as Appar, composed in Tamil rather than Sanskrit, devotion became a language of resistance\u2014simple yet profound, intimate yet transformative. These poets wrested spiritual expression from elite control and placed it in the hands of the people, reshaping both religious practice and the social fabric. Rebellion in Verse traces how this quiet revolution went on to leave a lasting imprint on Indian history.\nThe author will be present for an in-store signing. The event is open to all and will appeal to readers interested in history, religion, poetry, and social movements.",
