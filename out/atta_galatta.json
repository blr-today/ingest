    "description": "2025: With gender pronouns and rainbow flags, did the days of suffering and ostracization seem to be over for the trans and intersex community? DEI programs popped up, and gender fluidity became the buzz. Bathrooms and sports, rights to property, adoption, and marriage...why is LGBTQ a single category, where sexual preference is forcefully coalesced with gender? Is gender determined by birth, or is it a preference? Those were the questions.\n2026: Inclusion \u2013 not DEI. Sharp backlash and reversal of passport categories in the US. Where we were going as a society was confusing and scary for some, and now those voices are loud. The world has gone too far, they say. If they have a point, why does the third gender still knock on car windows, linger in oblivion, or have to be loud to be proud? The world fears \u2018normalization\u2019 of \u2018exception\u2019 - where is acceptance, acknowledgment, and understanding? Using Queer Chronicles and the issues the collection presents through the stories, this event will cover the why, how, and what next on gender, sexuality, and LGBTQIA activism for 2026. In discussion: Dr. Tanushree Ghosh, Senior Director Plus, Medtronic Inc., Author, Activist, Founder and Board Chair: Her Rights Inc., and Romal Laishram, Asst. Editor, Indulge, The New Indian Express; Diversity and Inclusion Trainer, Author, and Journalist.",

    "name": "Chaos in a Coupe: Travelling across India with Three Dogs - Book Launch by Divya Dugar",
    "description": "Atta Galatta is delighted to host the launch of Chaos in a Coupe: Travelling across India with Three Dogs by Divya Dugar on 25th Jan at 12:30 PM.\nOnce upon a time, there was a family: Divya Dugar, her partner Olivier, their tiny hooman Marius, and their three rescue streeties\u2014Tigress, Marcopolo and Pari. They lived in Delhi. And they wanted to go to other places.\nSo they booked a first-class coupe with the Indian Railways that allowed them to travel with their dogs. The sixsome went on many, many train journeys. It was not just about getting to a place, be it Goa, Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, but about seeing it with new eyes\u2014and ears and noses, which is inevitable when half your touring party is canine.\nAs they faced uncanny, hilarious situations and tried their best to grapple with systems designed for human convenience, the high point of the trips was often the adventures in the train compartment, which the dogs made their very own.\nA witty, whimsical, wry account of those journeys, accompanied by some stunning photographs, Chaos in a Coupe is a book that travellers, pet parents and anyone who likes a good read will enjoy.\nAbout the Author\nDivya Dugar is a journalist and storyteller with over fifteen years of experience covering news and producing long-form documentaries. Born in Rajasthan and having lived between Kolkata and Delhi, she studied at the Asian College of Journalism before going on to work as a producer on more than sixty reports/documentaries for European broadcasters, primarily ARTE. She also worked as a journalist for four years with France 2.\nHer writing has appeared in numerous publications (including The Book of Dog, edited by Hemali Sodhi and published by HarperCollins) and often draws from her love for animals, heritage architecture, train travel and places off the beaten path. Now based in Southeast Asia, Divya lives with her partner Olivier, their two young children Marius and Elora, and two dogs\u2014Marcopolo and Pari\u2014who are equal parts companions and chaos agents.",

Nature journaling is not about perfection\u2014it\u2019s about paying attention.

She believes art is a way to slow down, listen deeply, and build a personal relationship with the natural world. Her practice combines illustration, journalling, and storytelling to make creativity feel accessible rather than intimidating.\nThrough her workshops, Charu encourages participants to let go of \u201cgetting it right\u201d and instead focus on noticing, wondering, and enjoying the process. Her sessions are known for being warm, inclusive, and thoughtfully guided\u2014especially welcoming to beginners.",

She looks at it as a disruption \u2014 a moment when women begin to see themselves differently, take stock of friendships, rethink their roles, and slowly come into who they really are.\nShe asks simple but disarming questions: When do we actually become old? And how is coping with ageing any different from coping with puberty?\nThrough personal stories and observations, Lalita writes about losing estrogen, gaining perspective, building new tribes, and learning to live with bodies that are changing \u2014 with a mix of honesty, curiosity, and humour. For her, ageing becomes both a process of growing up and a kind of liberation.\nJoin us for an intimate reading and conversation around the themes of ageing, identity, and what it means to keep evolving.",

    "description": "Flash Jam Bangalore is a unique community of amateur singers and musicians that sing and harmonise together. No experience required - just a love for music and connection :)\n\r\nThis time, we're hosting a special, first-of-its-kind workshop! We learn the concepts of vocal harmony, chords, and composing, and then create harmonies together and sing them as a choir - using Hallelujah, by Leonard Cohen, as the base. We'll learn and imbibe concepts like:\n\r\n1. How do I find my vocal range? - terms like basses, baritones, tenors, altos, sopranos, broken down in simple terms, with a bonus lesson in voice modulation\r\n2. What are harmonies and chords? - how multiple different notes blend together, create complexity of emotions with simple changes, the anatomy of a chord\r\n3. How do I assign emotions to notes? - how the emotional spectrum of a scale can be used to create both melody and chords, with the same fundamentals\r\n4. How do I use chords in a song? - for a certain melody, how to choose chords, using overlapping notes with melody, internal progressions, least-change-algorithm, and more\r\n5. How can I visualise music better? - learn some basic exercises to compose and write chords on the fly, and be able to imagine sounds simply in your mind's eye\n\r\nSo come, elevate your skills, and immerse yourselves in the magic of vocal harmony!",

    "name": "Within the Mind Lantern - Book Signing with Keerti Nair",
    "description": "Within the Mind Lantern, is a beautifully collection of 41 poems, that has been very well received by the early readers. It is thoughtfully divided into four soul-stirring sections that reads like a gentle walk through memories, emotions, and quiet self-realization. With this poetry collection, the author lights small lanterns within the reader\u2019s mind, guiding them inward. The first section, poems on Nostalgia and Memories, feels like revisiting old photographs, bittersweet, familiar, and deeply comforting. They remind us how memories shape who we are, even when they hurt a little. In the section - Love, Family and Relations, the author captures the beauty of connection, the fragility of bonds, and the unspoken love that often lives between silences. The section on Nature, with gentle metaphors, the poems flow effortlessly, grounding the reader while offering moments of calm and reflection. The final section, Personal Growth and Inspiration, feels like a soft hand on your shoulder, encouraging, reassuring, and deeply empowering. They remind us that growth is personal, nonlinear, and beautifully imperfect. Within the Mind Lantern is not meant to be rushed. It is meant to be felt, revisited, and held close on quiet days. A luminous collection that speaks to the heart, this book is a perfect read if you are looking forward to reconnecting with yourself!\nReaders are invited to meet the author and get their copies signed at Atta Galatta.",

He will talk about selected stories and engage informally with the audience. Signed copies of the book will be on sale.\n\u00a0\nThe following are sample extracts from reviews on Amazon globally and on Goodreads:\n\u2022 India: \u201cINDISHMAN reminded me of the lyrical beauty of Arundhati Roy, the vivid storytelling of Salman Rushdie, and the magic of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\u201d\n\u2022 UK: \u201cA lovely meander through the vagaries of human nature. Each story warms the heart like a good malt whisky. A very well-written book; I defy anyone not to enjoy it.\u201d\n\u2022 USA: \u201cIt (INDISHMAN) is hard to slot into a specific genre \u2013 the stories, reflections and gentle musings flit from rural Kerala to Nepal, from Southampton to the high seas with ease. They strike the perfect balance between being sharply observed and deeply memorable, yet light enough for an effortlessly enjoyable read, and never without a touch of humour and heart. Without a doubt, this has been the best six dollars and change I\u2019ve spent in a very long time.\u201d",

    "description": "Join us at Atta Galatta for a book discussion with Dena Merriam, author of Sita\u2019s Yoga: The Yoga of Awakening, a reflective and spiritually resonant work that reimagines Sita as a guide for inner transformation.\nIn this book, Dena Merriam explores Sita not only as an avatar of the divine Narayani, but as a compassionate presence in the lives of ordinary people\u2014those navigating family, work, duty, and the search for meaning. Through these encounters, the narrative turns inward, examining the everyday battles we face with anger, greed, fear, arrogance, and indifference. Ravana emerges as a powerful symbol of the forces that pull human consciousness toward materialism and delusion, both in Sita\u2019s time and our own.\nWritten with clarity and depth, Sita\u2019s Yoga: The Yoga of Awakening invites readers to look within, to recognise and transform the shadows of the mind and heart, and to discover how inner awakening becomes the foundation for confronting the challenges of the outer world.\nDate: Sunday, 1 February\nTime: 5:00 PM \u2013 7:00 PM\nVenue: Atta Galatta, Bengaluru",

    "name": "Trial by Water - Book Signing with Uttam Kumar Sinha",
    "description": "Join us at Atta Galatta for a book signing with Uttam Kumar Sinha, author of Trial by Water, a timely and incisive exploration of the rivers that lie at the heart of India\u2013Pakistan relations.\nIn this book, Uttam Kumar Sinha traces the turbulent history of the Indus Basin, once a shared lifeline of the subcontinent and later a fractured landscape shaped by Partition, politics, and conflict. Beginning with 1947 and moving through the signing of the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960, the narrative examines how cooperation over water emerged even amidst deep hostility\u2014and why it has remained fragile. With the treaty\u2019s suspension by India in April 2025 following the Pahalgam terror attack, the book asks urgent questions about its future and the possibility of a new, more resilient framework.\nWritten with clarity and analytical depth, Trial by Water looks at the role of political leadership, regional tensions, and global pressures in shaping one of the world\u2019s most significant transboundary water agreements. By following the flow of the Indus rivers, the book offers a powerful lens through which to understand conflict, compromise, and survival in South Asia.\nDate: Tuesday, 10 February\nTime: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM\nVenue: Atta Galatta, Bengaluru",
