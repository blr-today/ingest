    "description": "Atta Galatta, Bengaluru\u2019s leading independent bookstore, will host a book discussion on the Tamil translation of Vasudhendra\u2019s acclaimed Kannada work Nammamma Andre Nangishta on Friday, May 31, 2025, at 5:00 PM. Titled Ammavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum in Tamil and published by Two Shores Press earlier this month ahead of the Mother\u2019s Day celebration, this new release offers Tamil readers a fresh window into this deeply personal narrative. The original Kannada edition has sold over 30,000 copies and received the Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Award in 2006. The book\u2019s wide-reaching impact is evident\u2014one of its essays features in the Kannada ICSE high school syllabus, and a stage adaptation has been performed more than 50 times at Bengaluru\u2019s iconic Rangashankara theatre.\nThe event will feature Vasudhendra in conversation with Tamil writer B. Kanmani, a powerful literary voice in her own right. The translator, K. Nallathambi, will also join the discussion.\nAmmavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum is a collection of memoir-like essays centered on the author\u2019s mother, with tenderness, wit, and unflinching honesty. This conversation will delve into the original work, the Tamil rendition, and the nuances of translating from Kannada to Tamil.\nIn Perumal Murugan\u2019s words:\n\"Ammavai Enakku Migavum Pidikkum, the celebrated Kannada author Vasudhendra\u2019s moving collection of memoir-like essays, offers not just a vivid portrait of his mother but a glimpse into her unique worldview. With a delicate balance of humor and self-mockery, the essays provoke hearty laughter even as they carry the weight of sorrow in many moments. The writing compels you forward\u2014once you finish one essay, you can\u2019t help but leap to the next. This is a book you\u2019ll want to read in a single breath.\"\nTwo Shores Press is a new independent publisher founded under the Brooklyn-based Ulysses Press Indie Accelerator. Focused on literary translation, it is dedicated to bridging linguistic and geographical divides through literature. The Tamil edition of Nammamma Andre Nangishta is a significant addition to the press's expanding collection of translations.",
