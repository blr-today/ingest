Based on the short story \"Patol Babu- Film Star\" by\u00a0Satyajit Ray.\nRamesh Babu once dreamed of seeing his name on movie posters. Today, he lives a quiet, ordinary life with a dusty ceiling fan and a patient wife. When fate unexpectedly casts him in a film, the world he left behind flickers back to life. Is this his long-awaited moment of recognition\u2014or merely a fleeting illusion?\nSet against the lively chaos of a film shoot and the warmth of home, the play gently reminds us that even the smallest moments can illuminate an entire life.\nBlending humour, nostalgia, and emotional depth, this high energy play,\u00a0The Star\u00a0celebrates rediscovering one\u2019s passion and reminds us that it is never too late to dream again.",

The topics could be varied like History, Sports, Music, Literature, Movies and more. A team of two members would get to choose a topic and the level of difficulty and the question would be revealed. The rest of the teams can go for the buzzer if they know the answer. Depending on the number\u00a0of teams registering, the size of the grid would be decided.\u00a0\nSAMPLE Qu: 2. The name is inspired by the traditional malt whisky distillation process in which malted barley was mixed by hand with shovels. This labor-intensive process often caused a shoulder injury to workers, causing their arms to hang low. Which brand is named thus?\u00a0\nGanesh Balakrishnan is an entrepreneur, marketer and creator of terrible dad jokes.

    "description": "BECAUSE GOOD GIRLS DON\u2019T CHANGE THE WORLD. For every woman who has been told she's \"too much,\" this is a memoir about becoming exactly who you're meant to be.\nSangeeta Pillai was called a \"Bad Daughter\" for defying the rigid expectations placed on \"good Indian girls.\" But in her rebellion, she found her voice. From a harrowing childhood in a Mumbai slum-haunted by a violent father and the brutal murder of her mother-this is a story of resilience. With a fire in her belly, she\nbattled patriarchy, chased her dreams, and built a new life in London, creating a successful podcast to inspire other women. Yet, all her success couldn't outrun the past. Faced with debilitating mental health, she explored many healing avenues from psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, EMDR, acupuncture to Tantra. But to truly heal, she had to go back to her birthplace: tropical Kerala to confront her deep trauma. There, she experienced the most profound spiritual transformation in Kerala's ancient temples. Sangeeta's powerful, spiritual and deeply inspiring journey shows us that healing means finding your way back home to yourself. Bad Daughter is an inspirational feminist memoir for every woman who wants to break free. Ultimately, it's a reminder that the courage to be your authentic self can transform your own life - and the lives of those around you.\nAuthor Description:\nSangeeta Pillai grew up in a Mumbai slum. Today, she is recognised as a leading voice for South Asian feminism globally. Award-winning podcaster, writer and feminist activist, Sangeeta is the creator of Masala Podcast (all about cultural taboos) which won 6 British Podcast Awards, 1 Audio Production Award & Spotify SoundUp 2018 award. She's also the founder of South Asian feminist network Soul Sutras. Sangeeta has been featured extensively in the press from BBC Radio, Guardian, Metro, Cosmopolitan, Evening Standard, Stylist, Eastern Eye to Huffington Post. As well as on giant billboards in New York, London, Dublin, Cardiff & Glasgow. She is also the creator of the Masala Monologues series of writing workshops & theatre shows in the UK & the US. Sangeeta is a regular speaker at WOW Festival, Podcast Show London, Shameless Festival, Primadonna Festival as well as being a regular speaker on innumerable panels and podcasts.",

    "name": "Aging (Un)Gracefully - Book Discussion with Lalita Iyer",
    "description": "In her memoir, Lalita reflects on ageing as something far more layered than simply \u201cgetting old\u201d. She looks at it as a disruption \u2014 a moment when women begin to see themselves differently, take stock of friendships, rethink their roles, and slowly come into who they really are.\nShe asks simple but disarming questions: When do we actually become old? And how is coping with ageing any different from coping with puberty?\nThrough personal stories and observations, Lalita writes about losing estrogen, gaining perspective, building new tribes, and learning to live with bodies that are changing \u2014 with a mix of honesty, curiosity, and humour. For her, ageing becomes both a process of growing up and a kind of liberation.\nJoin us for an intimate reading and conversation around the themes of ageing, identity, and what it means to keep evolving.",
