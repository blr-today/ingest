They stumble through a series of funny situations, starting with a comical argument over a park bench that ends in a shared tumble to the ground. Their day continues with a chaotic picnic where invisible food turns into an epic, imaginary food fight. Next, they encounter an invisible dog that leads to playful jealousy and laugh-out-loud antics as they take turns pretending to be the dog. Their antics move to a playground where they try to navigate invisible swings and a seesaw, resulting in more slapstick humour. Finally, Kuku and Madhu put on a magic show where every trick goes hilariously wrong, with Kuku trying to saw Madhu in half, resulting in more chaos and laughter. The play concludes with Kuku and Madhu saying a playful goodbye to the audience, ensuring that everyone leaves with a smile on their face. *\"The Silent Chaos\"* is a fun-filled, full of laughter and visual comedy, perfect for entertaining kids and igniting their imaginations.",

The play has been originally written by Ruskin Bond. It will be performed by Sachin Ravindran and directed by Vivek Vijayakumaran. There will be an activity for all the kids at the end! Once Upon a Time is part of our initiative to bring theatre and performance to children. In this program, children will get to watch a performance created using handpicked stories. The performance will be followed by an activity with the children to help them respond to the story in their own unique ways. The Thief`s Story was developed as part of this initiative at Our Theatre Collective in 2023. Our Theatre Collective is an independent collective creating original multi-lingual plays since 2009. Based out of Bangalore, our focus lies strongly on performance training for actors and theatre-makers. Our studio space in Koramangala, fondly called Our Theatre Studio, has also been hosting curated performances and showcases since 2018 and has recently become home to a variety of theatre-based events for young audiences as well.",
