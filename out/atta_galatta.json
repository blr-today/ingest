But I had the guts to sneak into my girlfriend\u2019s quarters\u2014don\u2019t ask why.\nMy best friend, Baiju, had the audacity to have an affair\u2014sorry, a relationship\u2014with the colony\u2019s schoolteacher.\nOur so-called ordinary life was filled with mischief, adventures, and escapades.\nOur shift to an ultra-ordinary life came with reckless schemes and acts of revenge, making the lives of the factory officers, who took their privilege a bit too literally, a living hell\u2014just to prove our worth.\nMy problem? I take things to heart and always make sure to get back at those who hurt me. This time, it was the cement company that wronged me, and I made sure to give back royally.\n\nRead The Colony Brats to learn how not to screw up your life\u2014and everyone else's\u2014with vengeance.
