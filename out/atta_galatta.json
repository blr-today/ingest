    "description": "India has a rich tradition of folk arts. The custodians of which are the many tribes that live in the interiors of various states. The Gonds, are the largest Adivasi Community in India and are Dravidian's whose origin can be traced to the pre-Aryan era. They are mainly found in Madhya Pradesh and its surrounding States. The word Gond comes from the Dravidian expression kond, meaning green mountain. In the Gond belief system, besides Bara Deo (Great God), every hill, river, lake, tree, and rock is inhabited by a spirit and therefore sacred. Gond paintings are fascinating, where the artists express their faiths and beliefs, world view, their visual expression and sense of identity, both as a collective, and as individuals. The motifs are further associated with the rich repertoire of the community and strongly show the interactions with the cosmic, natural and social worlds of humans at multiple levels and contexts. Participate in the Gond Painting Workshop, get a chance to appreciate the art form and create you very own Gond Art masterpiece on cartridge sheets with acrylic colours.\nTake away: One complete painting A3 size\nBook Here: 9867982075",

    "name": "Kalighat Painting Workshop - Art Workshop",
    "description": "The paintings derive its name from the Kalighat Temple which flourished as a popular art form with the rise of a settlement around the temple. Legend has it that Sati slew herself after Lord Shiva was insulted by her father Daksha. Following this, Shiva wandered with her body on his shoulder threatening to destroy the universe. Vishnu, the preserver of Earth, intervened and shattered Sati\u2019s body into 51 pieces which fell at different spots across the Indian subcontinent. These sites are known as Shakti Peethas. The toe of her right foot is said to have fallen at the site of the Kalighat Temple, associating it with Goddess Kalib- the ferocious form of Sati.\nWith bright colours, bold strokes, realistic figures, religious, as well as secular and civil subjects; these paintings catch the eyes of the appreciator in a jiffy. The subjects in the paintings are coloured but the base remains untouched. These characteristics came to be known as the key elements of the Kalighat paintings. The Kalighat Paintings were divided into two schools: The oriental school wherein Hindu gods and mythological figures were seen, and the occidental school that projected social evils and other secular themes.\nIn this fascinating workshop we will be working on a painting of Goddess Kali with acrylic paints on cartridge sheets. You will get to take away one complete painting (A3 size). The registration price is inclusive of all materials.\nBook Here: 9867982075",

    "description": "Mandala designs are applied in Persian art and architecture frequently. Here we are going to introduce Persian mandalas, their meaning, and characteristics.\nWhat is a Mandala?\nWhat we know about a mandala is that it is a geometric design and a symbol in Buddhism and Hinduism. In general, mandalas represent the universe. Mandalas are usually used to increase focus while meditating or doing yoga. In home d\u00e9cor designs, mandala tapestries, paintings or tiles can be hanged on the wall or used as a tablecloth or for bedding. In some cases, mandalas are used in decors because of their magnificent patterns and symbolic meaning for peace. Mandalas are very much engaged with home d\u00e9cor styles such as bohemian, hippie and gypsy in the modern design world.\nWhere do mandalas come from?\nMost of us might think mandalas root back only to India and Buddhism while there has been a wide use of mandala designs in the history of art in other religions and areas as well.\nMandala designs are applied in Persian art and architecture frequently. Here we are going to introduce Persian mandalas, their meaning, and characteristics.\nYou will take back your very own Persian Mandala Painting in A3 size paper.\nMake your own special art with acrylic colours on cartridge sheets.\nBook Here: 9867982075",
