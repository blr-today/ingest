A voracious reader and lifelong movie buff, his imagination was shaped by everything from murder mysteries and science fiction to drama and fantasy.\nBy profession, Manu is one of India\u2019s Top 40 Under 40 Data Scientists, teaching machines to do his job and uncover the hidden mysteries that numbers whisper. He often likens it to being a detective; solving puzzles and bringing clarity out of complexity. But when the screens dim, his creative world takes over. The Artist is his foray into weaving psychological suspense with the sharp instincts of a storyteller trained to observe patterns in both life and data.\nAway from data sets and dark plotlines, Manu finds rhythm in music, joy in books, and balance in the company of friends and family. His unique perspective (part scientist, part artist) makes him a rare new voice in Indian literature.\nAt this AG Lit Sisters gathering, Manu will share:\n\nThe making of The Artist and his journey from data science to fiction writing.\nHow reading, cinema, and real-life mysteries shape his storytelling.\nWhat it means to live between two worlds: logic and imagination.\nJoin us at Atta Galatta for an intimate, inspiring conversation with a storyteller who reminds us that both numbers and narratives hold secrets waiting to be uncovered",

    "description": "Topic: Engagement in Loneliness\nPeople make up big cities but what makes up people\u2019s lives, hopefully not loneliness. Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk2 of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.\nThis support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.\nThe support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",
