    "description": "Dive into a transformative journey with Neha Bhat, the insightful mind behind @indiansextherapist on Instagram, as she fearlessly tackles the intricacies of sex, sexuality, trauma and shame in her groundbreaking book, Unashamed.\nIn a society that often hushes discussions on the most fundamental aspects of human existence, Neha invites readers to explore the uncharted territories of their own desires. With a unique blend of empathy, humor, reflection and unwavering expertise, she dismantles the stigma surrounding sexuality, in turn, asking readers to embrace the full spectrum of their desires without reservation.\nUnashamed delves deep into the psychological landscape of shame, unravelling the roots that bind individuals and communities to outdated norms. Through engaging anecdotes, relatable case studies, and her own experiences as a sex therapist, Neha provides a roadmap for individuals seeking to understand, accept, and celebrate their unique sexual identities. Exercises, quizzes, and journalling prompts in the book gives readers practical tools to break free from the shackles of shame and embark on a liberating journey towards self-discovery.\nJoin us at Atta Galatta to meet the author of this path-breaking book, on 1st December at 2 PM!",
