    "description": "Join us for a very special event between Fungi Foundation India and Current Conservation magazine, featuring a documentary screening of \"The Mushroom Keepers\" \u2013 an evocative short film that unveils the profound relationships between fungi and the Khasi and Garo communities of Meghalaya, India.\nThe film explores how fungi shape spiritual and cultural worldviews through intimate conversations with community elders, revealing the intertwined loss of biodiversity and ancestral knowledge as old-growth forests dwindle.\nCurrent Conservation is a not-for-profit quarterly print and online magazine that works with scientists, researchers and artists across the world to tell stories from the field of conservation.\nThis FREE event will begin with a welcome reishi tea ceremony, followed by presentations and discussions that bridge mycology, culture and conservation. After the film, we'll transition to an art-based activity inspired by the latest edition of Current Conservation.\nBeyond the formal program, there will be plenty of mycological wisdom shared through laughter and conversation. It's a chance to connect with like-minded enthusiasts while exploring the fascinating world of fungi through cultural storytelling and creativity.\nCome share in this unique opportunity to learn, create, and connect!",

The choice of colours, mood and theme, sensory and emotional experience while painting gets influenced by the presence of sound and music in the environment where art is taking place impacting the artistic process and the final creation.\nInspired by this, we have a similar collaboration with artists Shilpi, Ayuushi, Priyanka and Khusbu who aspire to hold a Sound & Art Workshop for women wishing to experience such intense joy and creativity on 8th March 2025, International Women\u2019s Day.\nIt would be a treat to observe the participants flow with the sounds and express their art.\nTake away:\nPainting to add vibrancy to your room or your living. An ideal gift that you can make, gift and surprise anyone.\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to receive encouragement from peer women.\nWhat to Bring:\n\nYoga mat.\nShawl / stole.\nDrinking water bottle.\n\nNo prior art experience is necessary.\nParticipants should come with an open mind. All other materials will be provided.\nWear comfortable, light color cotton / linen clothing as absorbing the vibrations is easier.\nRegistration: Spaces are limited, so early registration is encouraged.",

The word Gond comes from the Dravidian expression kond, meaning green mountain. In the Gond belief system, besides Bara Deo (Great God), every hill, river, lake, tree, and rock is inhabited by a spirit and therefore sacred. Gond paintings are fascinating, where the artists express their faiths and beliefs, world view, their visual expression and sense of identity, both as a collective, and as individuals. The motifs are further associated with the rich repertoire of the community and strongly show the interactions with the cosmic, natural and social worlds of humans at multiple levels and contexts.

    "description": "You are cordially invited to a special rough-cut screening of TechnoCats, a documentary that delves into a personal journey of ambition, competition, and the high-stakes in the world of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the relentless pursuit of success in a fiercely competitive system.\nAt India\u2019s most elite engineering college, ambition is everything\u2014but so is survival. TechnoCats follows 7 students over 7 years, chasing success in a high-stakes environment where winner takes all. Layered with the perspective of an IIT alumnus from 35 years ago, the film paints a portrait of an institution that shapes not just careers, but identities and futures.\nThis is an opportunity to see the film in its rough-cut stage. We\u2019re looking for fresh perspectives\u2014your feedback will help shape the final version. We\u2019re also seeking support to complete the film, whether through funding, studio time, or connections that can help bring TechnoCats to a wider audience.\nYour presence, thoughts, and support\u2014of any kind\u2014would mean a lot to us. Looking forward to sharing this journey with you!\nGautam Sonti is an independent documentary filmmaker, who attempts to unearth stories that are hidden below the surface. Whether it\u2019s the subversion of democracy in a city government, the absurdity of food politics in the country, or the narrowing of young minds in our educational system, his films quietly capture life as it unfolds.\u00a0 They don\u2019t shout for attention, but invite audiences to pause, observe, and reconsider their positions. You can find out more about his work at gautamsonti.com\nOver the last 4 decades or so, Tara Rao graduated from being an architect to working on climate justice and human rights with various organisations, including Amnesty and WWF in Asia, Africa and Europe. As a campaigner though, the visual side of communication became more critical and exciting for her. That experience served her well when she led GoodPitch Karnataka - a process involving multiple people and initiatives shaping impactful communication through film to further a cause. Today the richness of possibilities and the deepening challenges keep her on her toes and buzzing.\u00a0 www.ourgroundworks.org",
