What do you do when you have to confront Death itself, when the answers you've been looking for are within your grasp?\n\"Mr. Seagull\" by Gabriela Barbosa follows the themes of growing up and abandoning your childhood. It deals with two characters, a little girl, and a seagull who have different responsibilities due to their positions in the world.

Aviendha is a proud Bangalorean and is thrilled to share her work with her city. Gabriela is a Brazilian actor who loves being on stage and is super excited to be a part of this project.",
