    "description": "As we evolved, humans became heavily dependent on each other for well being, survival and safety. Communal living helped individuals experience safety, belongingness and pride over painful experiences of fear, loneliness and shame. Among the many interpersonal developments consequent to communal living was the complex decision making of selecting a mating partner or a long-term romantic partner. The workshop attempts to delineate the factors involved in an individual decision making process pertaining to finding a partner and how those factors play out once the relationship begins to unfold.\nWhat can you expect from the workshop?\nA discussion on how gender roles have changed and gender specific expectations have changed over the years\nDefining one\u2019s value\nDiscussion on how one perceives one value/ and relevance to be in the context of society and family\nDiscussion on value acquired in family of origin (attachment-based value)\nDiscussion on value acquired among peers/society/communities based on attributes like intellect, physical looks, social status, financial resources\nDynamic interaction between these two different systems of value.\nDo we tend to enhance our value through associating with a certain partner and if so how much does that play into attraction?\nWhat is power and control in a relationship\nHow much does unresolved memories contribute to our concept of value\nIntroducing the concept of exile and critical self\nWhy do we tend to seek affection from those who have hurt us?\nDeeper discussion in to Anatomy of shame and how much it contributes to attraction\nRegular refreshments will be provided.\nThe workshop is organised by Dr Mathai Fenn, Dr Nimesh George And Dr Gokul Ratakonda, all of whom are practising psychotherapists and psychologists.",
