    "description": "Join us for a book signing session with author Shahnaz Habib, whose book Airplane Mode has been longlisted for the Andrew Carnegie Medals of Excellence!\nThis witty personal and cultural history of travel from the perspective of a Third World-raised woman of color, Airplane Mode, asks: what does it mean to be a joyous traveler when we live in the ruins of colonialism, capitalism and climate change?\nThe conditions of travel have long been dictated by the color of passports and the color of skin.\nThe color of one\u2019s skin and passport have long dictated the conditions of travel.\u00a0 For Shahnaz Habib, travel and travel writing have always been complicated pleasures. Habib threads the history of travel with her personal story as a child on family vacations in India, an adult curious about the world, and an immigrant for whom roundtrips are an annual fact of life. Tracing the power dynamics that underlie tourism, this insightful debut parses who gets to travel, and who gets to write about the experience.\nThreaded through the book are inviting and playful analyses of obvious and not-so-obvious travel artifacts: passports, carousels, bougainvilleas, guidebooks, trains, the idea of wanderlust itself. Together, they tell a subversive history of travel as a Euro-American mode of consumerism\u2014but as any traveler knows, travel is more than that. As an immigrant whose loved ones live across continents, Habib takes a deeply curious and joyful look at a troubled and beloved activity.",

    "description": "On this evening, we invite you to join us for a screening of the cinematic adaptation of Timothee de Fombelle\u2019s Toby Lolness, that has been made into a mini-series, followed by a conversation with children\u2019s author Bijal Vachharajani on the alchemical magic that goes into creating new worlds in literature. This event will for those aged 10 and above!\nToby Alone and its sequel Toby and the Secrets of the Tree tell the story of a boy a millimeter and a half tall who lives in an oak tree and must save it from destruction. With a deft hand at describing climate change, social discrimination, extractivism and capitalist violence, themes usually explored in the adult world, de Fombelle brings to life all the horrors of the world we live in, in a bewitchingly charming world of childhood fantasy. Clever, challenging and true, Toby\u2019s adventures craft a path for children to form their own journey into bravery and for things worth fighting for.\nIn this event, we hope to watch two episodes of the gorgeously hand-drawn animated series Toby Lolness following which we will have a discussion between Timothee de Fombelle and Bijal Vachharajani on the tools of their craft in creating a rich and vibrant new world. For children who are interested in growing up to be writers, and for adults who want to remember what it is like to be children while they write, this event will explore questions like: how much of the real world needs to be part of the worlds we create? What kind of stories do children like, the ones where they are safe, or the ones which show them the nature of the world and their place in it? And what\u2019s the most evil character you can ever imagine, and how do you imagine him into existence?\nTimothee de Fombelle was born in the heart of Paris in 1973, but often accompanied his architect father on his travels to Africa. Each summer his family left for the countryside (the west of France), where the five brothers and sisters lived like wild horses, making huts in the trees, playing in the river and losing themselves in the woods. In the evening they performed plays for their parents and devoured the books in the library. Childhood remains for him the lost paradise which he re-discovers through writing.\nIn 2006, he made his debut as an author with Toby Alone, a young adult novel published by Gallimard Jeunesse. The novel met with great success and has been translated into 29 languages. It has received 20 awards, including the English Marsh Award for Children's Literature in Translation, the Italian Andersen Award, and most French awards for children's literature. The movie rights were bought by Amber Entertainment (UK, United States).\nWe hope to see you all at 6.30 pm on February 1 at Atta Galata in Indiranagar, Bangalore for this event marking the inauguration of the Pardon my French! corner, followed by high tea and snacks!",

    "description": "Great things happen when women connect.\nSound is the source of this entire creation.\nDid you know that the sound of the musical notes have a profoundly positive impact on our chakras?\nWhether you receive the sounds from sacred singing bowls meant for the purpose of healing or well-being, or you sing the notes yourself, they bring in a sense of balance.\nAs this balance fosters feelings of joy and peace, it can aid creative expression in many forms.\nPainting is one such creative form that is closely associated with sound and music. The choice of colours, mood and theme, sensory and emotional experience while painting gets influenced by the presence of sound and music in the environment where art is taking place impacting the artistic process and the final creation.\nInspired by this, we have a similar collaboration with artists Shilpi, Ayuushi, Priyanka and Khusbu who aspire to hold a Sound & Art Workshop for women wishing to experience such intense joy and creativity on 8th March 2025, International Women\u2019s Day.\nIt would be a treat to observe the participants flow with the sounds and express their art.\nTake away:\nPainting to add vibrancy to your room or your living. An ideal gift that you can make, gift and surprise anyone.\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to receive encouragement from peer women.\nWhat to Bring:\n\nYoga mat.\nShawl / stole.\nDrinking water bottle.\n\nNo prior art experience is necessary.\nParticipants should come with an open mind. All other materials will be provided.\nWear comfortable, light color cotton / linen clothing as absorbing the vibrations is easier.\nRegistration: Spaces are limited, so early registration is encouraged.",
