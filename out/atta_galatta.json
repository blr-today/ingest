People who love to do things for us even if it makes them uncomfortable, even though it may be challenging for them \u2013 and vice versa. It\u2019s the magic of love.\nWe go through obstacles every day, do things that are difficult, go to sleep, wake up the next morning and we are willing to meet the day again \u2013 everyday. That we do that is nothing short of magic. We run from one thing to another everyday without really pausing and looking. If we did we\u2019d realize that the world we live in is full of magic.\nThe play uses elements of folk, absurdity, music, song and dance to create a visual treat on stage. And in the spirit of being jugaad, all of these visuals are created with small everyday things around us \u2013 because even the smallest thing has the potential to be something big.",
