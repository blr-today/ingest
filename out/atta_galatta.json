    "description": "We are so glad that you stand by Pawga to support animal welfare!\nWhat is Pawga, anyway?\nPawga was started in 2020 to help shelter pets socialise, find a forever home and also raise funds for the shelter. We pioneered puppy yoga in India and slowly introduced other experiences to help more people from different walks of life to interact and experience the joy of shelter puppies.\nWhat happens at Read with Puppies/Dogs at Pawga?\nAt Pawga\u2019s Read with Puppies you\u2019d be relaxing with a book as the puppies run around you. In fact, you would be given a free book from us.\nThese books are a surprise and the puppies would be running around you. Also please note that you could be meeting older dogs and older, bigger puppies too. Animals comes in all sizes and we love them and you should too. These are the pets requiring immediate adoption and that\u2019s why they\u2019re there.\nBut, why on earth should I join Pawga?\nUmmm, because we\u2019re cool. Kiddding!!! (not really).\nAll the puppies or older dogs you see at Pawga are from your local animal shelter. They are all up for adoption and the best part is that a portion of the tickets go towards the welfare of animals at the shelter. In Bangalore we work with Charlie\u2019s Animal Rescue.\nWhy does any of this matter amidst all my existential crisis and joys?\nBecause sometimes you shouldn\u2019t worry too much with \u2018because\u2019.\nBecause at some level you know you need to contribute to your wellness and need a fun hobby. Plus what better way to finish your reading goals on Goodreads than with puppies?\nBecause these puppies/dogs don\u2019t get the affection they need and even if you can\u2019t exactly know with their wagging tails, you meeting them could be the best day in their life.\nIf you are convinced, try it out \u2013 join us in Bangalore to know more!",
