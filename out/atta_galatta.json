She reveals how creativity offers healing, clarity, and a\u00a0 sense of purpose, whether through colours on canvas, words on paper, or designs on a screen. Like the shifting patterns of a kaleidoscope, each story reveals a unique perspective, yet together they form a vibrant tapestry of human experience.\nJoin us at Atta Galatta for a special signing and an opportunity to hear the inspirations behind her compelling narratives.Meet the author, discover the stories behind the pages, and take home a signed copy that\u2019s sure to stay with you long after the last line.",

    "description": "Atta Galatta is delighted to host author Zeenath Khan for a discussion on her powerful new novel, The Sirens of September, a sweeping work of historical fiction set against the turbulent backdrop of Hyderabad\u2019s 1948 integration, Partition, and the shadowy world of espionage.\nThe novel follows Farishteh Ali Khan, a young aristocrat whose sheltered life in princely Hyderabad is upended as she is drawn into a maze of political intrigue, family secrets, and shifting loyalties. Moving between the opulent corridors of Hyderabad, the refugee camps of post-Partition Bombay, military command rooms, and the underbelly of Piccadilly in London, Khan crafts a vivid narrative of a world in upheaval.\nAt its heart, the story explores Farishteh\u2019s unexpected bond with air force pilot Saleem El Edroos, a relationship tested by distance, war, and the consequences of a fallen kingdom. The fate of their families rests on a single figure\u2014one whose power to save them is equal to their ability to destroy everything.\nJoin us for an engaging conversation on history, identity, and storytelling with one of the most compelling new voices in Indian historical fiction.",

    "description": "The Qu for Quiz is based on a grid format with the grids formed by topics on one axis and level of difficulty (and hence the points) on the other. The topics could be varied like History, Sports, Music, Literature, Movies and more. A team of two members would get to choose a topic and the level of difficulty and the question would be revealed. The rest of the teams can go for the buzzer if they know the answer. Depending on the number\u00a0of teams registering, the size of the grid would be decided.\u00a0\nSAMPLE Qu: 2. The name is inspired by the traditional malt whisky distillation process in which malted barley was mixed by hand with shovels. This labor-intensive process often caused a shoulder injury to workers, causing their arms to hang low. Which brand is named thus?\u00a0\nGanesh Balakrishnan is an entrepreneur, marketer and creator of terrible dad jokes. His claim to fame is attempting to sell shoes during the pandemic, culminating in a viral Shark Tank \"Down But Not Out\" appearance. He is a collector of useless facts since childhood, and has dabbled in trivia quiz circuits since college. ganesh.flatheads@gmail.com\n\r\nKarthik Srinivasan is a pseudo-retired software leader by choice, specializing in innovative ideas to spend time that include organizing cricket leagues at the scale of IPL but for free, staying up to date on latest debates in virtual social groups helmed by family and friends and more on similar lines. emailkarth@gmail.com",

For those who live for spontaneous road trips, mountain treks, beach escapades, and serendipitous conversations with strangers\u2014and secretly nurture the hope of finding love and companionship along the way\u2014Priyanka Kumar\u2019s latest collection is a deeply relatable read. With its mix of short stories and memoir-style reflections, this book resonates with those who believe that real connection and personal discovery often happen far away from the familiar.\nThe newest installment in Priyanka\u2019s celebrated People\u2019s Kafe series, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle brings together heartfelt stories and travel-infused memories that capture the healing magic of nature and the unspoken bonds we form with people and places. Though it\u2019s not a travelogue in the conventional sense, the book reads like one\u2014with vivid glimpses into landscapes and emotions that stay with the reader long after they turn the final page.\nAnd yet, the book is as much about the people as it is about the places. There are tales of peacocks who roamed her childhood garden like kin, strangers-turned-friends on spontaneous journeys, and even encounters that subtly hint at love blossoming when least expected. The presence of love\u2014gentle, unforced, and organic\u2014is a quiet undercurrent in a couple of these stories, offering a warm, relatable thread for every romantic dreamer who has ever looked out of a train window and wondered, what if?",
