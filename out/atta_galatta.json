A voracious reader and lifelong movie buff, his imagination was shaped by everything from murder mysteries and science fiction to drama and fantasy.\nBy profession, Manu is one of India\u2019s Top 40 Under 40 Data Scientists, teaching machines to do his job and uncover the hidden mysteries that numbers whisper. He often likens it to being a detective; solving puzzles and bringing clarity out of complexity. But when the screens dim, his creative world takes over. The Artist is his foray into weaving psychological suspense with the sharp instincts of a storyteller trained to observe patterns in both life and data.\nAway from data sets and dark plotlines, Manu finds rhythm in music, joy in books, and balance in the company of friends and family. His unique perspective (part scientist, part artist) makes him a rare new voice in Indian literature.\nAt this AG Lit Sisters gathering, Manu will share:\n\nThe making of The Artist and his journey from data science to fiction writing.\nHow reading, cinema, and real-life mysteries shape his storytelling.\nWhat it means to live between two worlds: logic and imagination.\nJoin us at Atta Galatta for an intimate, inspiring conversation with a storyteller who reminds us that both numbers and narratives hold secrets waiting to be uncovered",

Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness.

This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.\nThis support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.\nThe support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

Assigned to a chaotic school once led by the mysteriously absent Salma Khatoon, Samiran's efforts to restore order only lead him deeper into unsettling events. From a water shortage to a snake in his room, his attempts to connect with the eccentric villagers only intensify his isolation. But behind it all, Samiran harbors a secret\u2014someone named Vrindaban. Why does he hide this figure? Is it the only refuge in a world that refuses to understand him? The play unravels questions about isolation, hidden truths, and the blurred lines between personal and professional life.\nAbout the artist:\u00a0 Somudranil Sarkar, a theatre maker from kolkata. He has over 25 years of experience in theatre and has had the privilege of training under some of the most respected names in the Bengali theatre circuit, including Rudraprasad Sengupta, Swatilekha Sengupta, Debshankar Halder, Sohini Sengupta, and Goutam Halder in Nandikar.
