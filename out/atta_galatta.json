    "description": "The Qu for Quiz is based on a grid format with the grids formed by topics on one axis and level of difficulty (and hence the points) on the other. The topics could be varied like History, Sports, Music, Literature, Movies and more. A team of two members would get to choose a topic and the level of difficulty and the question would be revealed. The rest of the teams can go for the buzzer if they know the answer. Depending on the number\u00a0of teams registering, the size of the grid would be decided.\u00a0\nSAMPLE Qu: 2.

This labor-intensive process often caused a shoulder injury to workers, causing their arms to hang low.
