The event will take place on Thursday, 7th November at 3:30 PM at Atta Galatta, one of the city\u2019s most beloved indie bookstores.\nVijayann\u2019s collection features eleven deeply personal essays that explore the silences Indian women have been taught to maintain\u2014at home, in relationships, and within themselves. Set in 1990s India, the essays delve into themes of girlhood, family, bodily autonomy, and the emotional inheritance of silence. With candour and nuance, the book speaks to the resilience it takes to find and reclaim one\u2019s voice.\nBased in Washington, Meera Vijayann has written extensively on gender, mental health, and social justice, with bylines in The Guardian, Forbes, Catapult, and Electric Literature. Her widely viewed TED talk on experiencing sexual assault as a young girl in India continues to resonate with audiences around the world.\nThe event offers readers a rare opportunity to meet the author in person and engage with her work, which is already being recognised as a bold and timely contribution to feminist literature",

When time itself starts to fracture in the bylanes of Dadar?\nThe story carries a healthy blend of vada pav vendors and cosmic voids. It is about Mumbai and how it exists in a state of quantum superposition. Consider the evidence. The local trains are both full and somehow still accepting passengers. It is raining and not raining, depending on which side of the street you're standing on. Infrastructure - crumbling yet functioning. A perfect backdrop for a mythology tech fiction novel. You get the gist \ud83d\ude0e.\nIn Thuldrun.\u015a\u016bny\u0101, authors Samiran Ghosh and Sheetal Choksi weave a believable, albeit fictional, tale in which reality isn't quite what it seems.

Is he losing his mind, or is the universe itself unravelling?\nIn an interactive session, Samiran and Sheetal will chat about why and how they wrote the book, why the title, why the Book of \u267e\ufe0f and more.\nDate: November 22, 2025\nTime: 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM\nVenue: Atta Galatta, Bangalore\nBooks will be available for purchase and signing.",

    "name": "The Stray Dogs of Landour Network: A True Story by a Failed Dog Trainer - Book Launch by Lalitha Krishnan",
    "description": "Lalitha Krishnan will introduce her new memoir in an interactive session. Released earlier this year, the book is available in both print and e-book formats on Amazon, Pothi.com, and Flipkart. It is a testament to the profound lessons of compassion, resilience, and belonging taught by free-ranging dogs.\nThe story begins in Landour, where Krishnan, a newly certified dog trainer fighting battles of her own, encounters a troubled stray named Pretty on her doorstep. With a training manual in hand, she intends to help Pretty find a home. But Pretty has a different plan, and with quiet intelligence, she leads Krishnan into her world, introducing her to her pup and the rest of the pack.\nInspired by the philosophy of Ubuntu (\u201cI am because we are\u201d), Krishnan finds herself feeding, training, and caring for a growing network of dogs in an international neighbourhood. In doing so, she begins to heal, learning that her canine companions have as much to teach her as she has to teach them. The dogs, with their innate wisdom and social dynamics, reshape Krishnan\u2019s understanding of love and survival.\nThe Stray Dogs of Landour Network: A True Story by a Failed Dog Trainer features a foreword by the late travel writer Bill Aitken, who also contributed a chapter titled \u201cMussoorie Dogs and Dog Lovers I Love.\u201d Krishnan recounts stories shared by authors Stephen Alter and Ganesh Saili, both residents of Landour. Her book is a tribute to the silent, unseen lives of the animals who share our world and the emotional truths they awaken within us.\nReview:\n\u201cThe Stray Dogs of Landour Network is a deeply personal, unflinchingly honest memoir that sits comfortably on the shelf alongside Helen Macdonald\u2019s H Is for Hawk or Sy Montgomery\u2019s The Soul of an Octopus. It is a story of survival, not just of dogs, but of people finding grace in the act of caring without conditions.\u00a0\nA poignant, slow-blooming debut that blends environmental awareness with emotional depth. Lalitha Krishnan\u2019s voice is one of rare integrity, grounded, observant, and quietly radical in its compassion.\u201d\n\u00a0\u2014 The Literature Today\nAbout the Author:\nLalitha Krishnan is a writer, podcaster, potter, and nature documenter based in Ranikhet in the Indian Himalaya. Her work explores the bonds between humans, animals, and the natural world. A certified dog trainer, Krishnan is passionate about dogs and wildlife and has contributed to publications including Dogs & Pups Magazine, Garhwal Post, RoundGlass Sustain, and Sanctuary Asia, among others.",

    "description": "It is seldom that we find a blend of two mainstream professions.\u00a0 Despite being busy in their respective specialities, Dr Latha Venkateswaran and Dr Ranjan Pejaver have taken time to explore the art of writing. While they have written articles and papers which are mainly medical, it is heartening to know they have ventured into writing fiction in the not-so-recent past.\nWelcome to an evening with two doctors-turned-published-authors who would like to meet and greet you. You will also be treated to soulful melodies played beautifully on the saxophone by Asha Elisha, an accomplished singer and musician.\nAbout Dr. Latha:\nDr Latha is a practicing pediatric surgeon for twenty years now. She did her undergrad from Kasturba Medical College (KMC), Mangalore, and her post-graduation FRCS (Paediatric Surgery) from the UK. She currently lives and works in Bangalore, India. This is her first attempt at story telling. Reading and writing have always been her passion. She loves thrillers and twists and brings out the most unique way of portraying this in all her stories. Her husband, son, and daughter ably support her in her passion. Ripples is a collection of short stories. It is a work of fiction. The author has attempted to present real life situations in a story form. They are all different in their content but have a characteristic twist at the end of the story.\nDr Ranjan Pejaver:\nDr Ranjan Pejaver is a renowned Pediatrician and Neonatologist. Dr Ranjan Pejaver has to his credit, more than 30 books and 150 scientific papers in his speciality. An innovator and researcher, he is an eminent speaker and a sought-after teacher. He is a well-travelled person. \u201cThe Heaven As I Saw\u201d is a thoughtful, imaginative take on life; more rather, life soon after death! In his first non-medial book, the author Dr Ranjan Pejaver, has deftly handled the most unusual theme, holding the readers\u2019 attention all the while. The novel is earthly and penetrative. It interrogates questions of morality and ethics in modern society. A most unusual journey of the Hero of the book. He gains wisdom through this trip. Could be inspiring for the readers.\nAbout Asha Elisha:\nAsha Elisha hails from a musical family, and has been a musician and singer all her life. She realised her dream of playing the saxophone in October 2022, when she began taking lessons from a professional musician. Since then, she hasn\u2019t looked back, and has built up her saxophone repertoire to cover English Retro, Jazz, Gospel, Western Classical and Bollywood songs. Asha is available to play for musical gigs. You can listen to her recordings on YouTube: @ohsosaxy-7 (Oh So Saxy)",
