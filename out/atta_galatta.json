    "name": "No Pride In Genocide - Film Screening",
    "description": "About the Screening: Join us for Filmistin\u2019s \"No Pride in Genocide\". A screening of short films that bring to light the lives of queer Palestinians while also exposing the reality of Israel\u2019s pinkwashing. This will be the first time this screening is being held in India, after having travelled through six countries.\u00a0\nThe screening will be followed by a fundraiser and discussion, the panel for which includes Arvind Narrain and Collective's Twisha Mehta.\nAbout the Films:\nSultana\u2019s Reign by Hadi Moussally\nSynopsis: This film introduces Sultana of New York, a Palestinian drag queen, performer, and artist. It opens with Sultana in conversation with Jordanian artist RIDIKKULUZ as she is being painted. Reflecting on her journey through Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and finally to New York, Sultana shares her experiences of performing drag in conservative societies, her nostalgia for the glamour of Egyptian cinema, and her unwavering commitment to embracing her identity as a performer.\n\r\nBleeding By Moaad Ghadir\nDuring the director\u2019s childhood, he experienced heavy bleeding that felt like an abortion. His parents took him to a specialist and that was that. All these years the memory remained. Did it really happen?\n\r\nClosing Documentary Pinkwashing Exposed: Seattle Fights Back! by Dean Spade\nSynopsis: This documentary examines the term \"pinkwashing,\" a strategy used by countries with serious human rights violations to promote themselves as \"gay-friendly.\" Focusing on Israel's efforts to distract from its abuses against Palestinians, the film delves into the response from Pacific Northwestern activists to a pinkwashing tour funded by the Israeli Consulate. It highlights the significant backlash against this propaganda and the activism that emerged in Seattle to counter these narratives.\n\r\nAbout Filmistin Collective:\nFilmistin is a collective founded in March 2024 dedicated to organizing screenings of short films by Palestinian filmmakers and artists. The founding members and core organizers until today are Deena Arouk, Mahdi Baraghithi, and Alexander Ephrussi, and together they have organized 13 events in the first 5 months of our collective alone spanning over 6 countries (US, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy). Their purpose is double, to create a space for Palestinian film, a medium that they consider essential both for its artistic and informative value and to raise money for families in Gaza. This screening is being organised in collaboration with the coalition Bengaluru For Justice and Peace.",

But I had the guts to sneak into my girlfriend\u2019s quarters\u2014don\u2019t ask why.\nMy best friend, Baiju, had the audacity to have an affair\u2014sorry, a relationship\u2014with the colony\u2019s schoolteacher.\nOur so-called ordinary life was filled with mischief, adventures, and escapades.\nOur shift to an ultra-ordinary life came with reckless schemes and acts of revenge, making the lives of the factory officers, who took their privilege a bit too literally, a living hell\u2014just to prove our worth.\nMy problem? I take things to heart and always make sure to get back at those who hurt me. This time, it was the cement company that wronged me, and I made sure to give back royally.\n\nRead The Colony Brats to learn how not to screw up your life\u2014and everyone else's\u2014with vengeance.
