    "description": "On this evening, we invite you to join us for a screening of the cinematic adaptation of Timothee de Fombelle\u2019s Toby Lolness, that has been made into a mini-series, followed by a conversation with children\u2019s author Bijal Vachharajani on the alchemical magic that goes into creating new worlds in literature. This event will for those aged 10 and above!\nToby Alone and its sequel Toby and the Secrets of the Tree tell the story of a boy a millimeter and a half tall who lives in an oak tree and must save it from destruction. With a deft hand at describing climate change, social discrimination, extractivism and capitalist violence, themes usually explored in the adult world, de Fombelle brings to life all the horrors of the world we live in, in a bewitchingly charming world of childhood fantasy. Clever, challenging and true, Toby\u2019s adventures craft a path for children to form their own journey into bravery and for things worth fighting for.\nIn this event, we hope to watch two episodes of the gorgeously hand-drawn animated series Toby Lolness following which we will have a discussion between Timothee de Fombelle and Bijal Vachharajani on the tools of their craft in creating a rich and vibrant new world. For children who are interested in growing up to be writers, and for adults who want to remember what it is like to be children while they write, this event will explore questions like: how much of the real world needs to be part of the worlds we create? What kind of stories do children like, the ones where they are safe, or the ones which show them the nature of the world and their place in it? And what\u2019s the most evil character you can ever imagine, and how do you imagine him into existence?\nTimothee de Fombelle was born in the heart of Paris in 1973, but often accompanied his architect father on his travels to Africa. Each summer his family left for the countryside (the west of France), where the five brothers and sisters lived like wild horses, making huts in the trees, playing in the river and losing themselves in the woods. In the evening they performed plays for their parents and devoured the books in the library. Childhood remains for him the lost paradise which he re-discovers through writing.\nIn 2006, he made his debut as an author with Toby Alone, a young adult novel published by Gallimard Jeunesse. The novel met with great success and has been translated into 29 languages. It has received 20 awards, including the English Marsh Award for Children's Literature in Translation, the Italian Andersen Award, and most French awards for children's literature. The movie rights were bought by Amber Entertainment (UK, United States).\nWe hope to see you all at 6.30 pm on February 1 at Atta Galata in Indiranagar, Bangalore for this event marking the inauguration of the Pardon my French! corner, followed by high tea and snacks!",

    "description": "What happens when two friends in the cosmopolitan city make it through the city\u2019s traffic and their \u201call grown up\u201d schedules to finally sit down for a conversation? A bunch of stories make it to the table. The stories barely make sense, but who cares? Hasn't life been like that since you started adulting on some random Tuesday?\nJoin Simrran and Roshan for a candid chat as they confess awkward adulting moments, unravel the joke they drafted during a midweek meltdown, and share how fiction, storytelling & authoring became their companions in this melange of life.\nSimrran Sidhu is Bengaluru-based writer, first-time author and perpetually a curious Anecdotist. She finds the most \u2018Monday\u2019 like anecdotes great for her blogs and stories. Often spotted on long walks\u00a0 finding stories, she\u2019s later found at her desk, trying to make sense of the conundrums she\u2019s collected. All of this unfolds with a little humour, a dash of introspection and a lot of food metaphors. If not at her desk, you will probably find her trying to untangle herself out of a Yoga posture.\nBut what\u2019s for dessert? is her debut book, - a collection of short stories, set in the tech-savvy city of Bengaluru. The stories find life around the protagonist's friends, family, career and the flawed decisions that accompany her, but by the end of the day, she basks in the glory of having made the right dessert choice.\nRoshan C Machayya\u00a0is an ultra-runner, a PhD scholar, a biker, a musician, writer, and currently an assistant professor at RV University at the School of Law, Bengaluru. An avid enthusiast for life with a penchant for chasing sunrises coupled with a passion for coffee and great food accompanied with even better company, he takes life with strides inspired by intention and contemplation.",

But Anand Seshadri, the powerful head of the Department of Electronics pushes to import the technology from the US.\nThe \u2018silicon metal controversy\u2019 erupts, and the prime minister must decide: Support Indian innovation?

And then the French and the Americans, and the Indian intelligence get involved.\nSet in the New Delhi of the 1980s, this tale of espionage, intrigue, deception and sexual escapade is pacy, funny . . . and sometimes touching. Join us for a chat with the author of this enthralling book!\nRamjee Chandran is a journalist and author, and was the Editor of \u2018Explocity\u2019 magazine.

    "name": "Women's Sound and Art Workshop - Wellness Workshop",
    "description": "Great things happen when women connect.\nSound is the source of this entire creation.\nDid you know that the sound of the musical notes have a profoundly positive impact on our chakras?\nWhether you receive the sounds from sacred singing bowls meant for the purpose of healing or well-being, or you sing the notes yourself, they bring in a sense of balance.\nAs this balance fosters feelings of joy and peace, it can aid creative expression in many forms.\nPainting is one such creative form that is closely associated with sound and music. The choice of colours, mood and theme, sensory and emotional experience while painting gets influenced by the presence of sound and music in the environment where art is taking place impacting the artistic process and the final creation.\nInspired by this, we have a similar collaboration with artists Shilpi, Ayuushi, Priyanka and Khusbu who aspire to hold a Sound & Art Workshop for women wishing to experience such intense joy and creativity on 8th March 2025, International Women\u2019s Day.\nIt would be a treat to observe the participants flow with the sounds and express their art.\nTake away:\nPainting to add vibrancy to your room or your living. An ideal gift that you can make, gift and surprise anyone.\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to receive encouragement from peer women.\nWhat to Bring:\n\nYoga mat.\nShawl / stole.\nDrinking water bottle.\n\nNo prior art experience is necessary.\nParticipants should come with an open mind. All other materials will be provided.\nWear comfortable, light color cotton / linen clothing as absorbing the vibrations is easier.\nRegistration: Spaces are limited, so early registration is encouraged.",
