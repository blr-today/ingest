    "description": "India\u2019s \u201990s kids grew up in an offline world and graduated to one that\u2019s hyperconnected and seemingly always on fire. This generation\u2019s psyche is riddled with qualms about identity, politics, capitalism, technology, relationships, selfhood, and what it means to live authentically\u2014and in Famous Last Questions, Sanjana Ramachandran strikes at the heart of their confusion.\nShe is sincere and ironic, self-flagellating and observant, and witheringly funny. In a heroic attempt to understand why she is the way she is, she takes a scalpel to her childhood trauma and ends up with the socio-political machinery that set the scene for it, thinking out loud: Why is \u2018Science, Arts, or Commerce\u2019 how we decide the course of our lives? Why must we believe in God? Should women get married before the age of thirty, or die trying? Why is domesticity so difficult when she isn\u2019t the \u2018perfect\u2019 housewife? How has the internet exposed Indian culture? And can virtue actually kill people?\nFamous Last Questions plays with the boundaries of memoir, reportage, and research, and is a must-read for anyone grappling with these questions! Join us for the launch of this riveting book at Atta Galatta on 27th April, at 7 PM.",
