    "name": "Woman and the Moon - Book Launch",
    "description": "The moon is worshipped as a living goddess across many cultures, be in Greek, Roman, Chinese, or Egyptian. In the Greco-Roman tradition, the moon is known by various names, such as Cynthia, Diana, and Selene, whereas Egyptians prayed to Isis as the moon goddess. Isis is also the mother of the ancient religion of Wicca, a philosophy Jagari was deeply influenced by, in the form in which it is practised in India. She was introduced to Wicca by poet Rajorshi Patranabis, a senior Wiccan whom she fondly calls Rajorshi Da. Subsequently, she attended classes taught by the Wiccan High Priestess, Ipsita Roy Chakraverti. She was drawn to this ideal, at the core of which lies the honoring of the feminine energy, or Shakti. Needless to add, she was smitten by the moon goddess.\nIn November 2023, Rajorshi Da tagged Jagari in a social media post challenging her to complete 10 poems in 10 days. The fates conspired and her first poem was titled \"Woman and the Moon.\" Once she started writing, she found that she could not stop. Hence, were born these 70 poems with the moon at the center. However, other than the woman and the moon, there is a third character\u2014the \"you\" or the (male) lover whom the woman addresses. These three characters come together in a symphony in each of the poems. The woman is the \u201cI\u201d of the poem, the man is the \u201cyou\u201d, and the moon is a omniscient presence. The tenor of every poem varies according to the lights and shadows of the woman's moods.\nAnd so, dear reader, we welcome you to enjoy the shimmering pageant of\u00a0 \"Woman and the Moon.\"",
