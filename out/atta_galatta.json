This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.\nThis support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.\nThe support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore.

    "name": "Bebey\u2019s Day Out - Book Discussion",
    "description": "Step into the richly woven world of Bebey\u2019s Day Out by Lakshmi C.V, where stories move\nseamlessly across centuries, cities, and states of mind. From the bustling IT hubs of modern\nIndia to the quiet cotton fields of the seventeenth-century Deccan, Lakshmi crafts tales that\nexplore the fragile boundaries between the ordinary and the extraordinary, the real and the\nsupernatural. Each story opens a window into a different world \u2014 one filled with love, loss, guilt,\nand grace.\nPopulated with a memorable cast \u2014 from a spirited old lady to a weary housewife and a\nrestless teenager \u2014 this collection delves into the raw, unguarded emotions that make us\nhuman. Told with insight, warmth, and gentle humour, Bebey\u2019s Day Out is a celebration of life\u2019s\nunpredictability, reminding us that beneath every moment of chaos or calm lies a story waiting to\nbe told.\nAbout the author\nLakshmi C.V. is a writer who delightfully blurs the lines between being a storyteller and a\nhomemaker \u2014 though she\u2019s still deciding which came first. A Physics graduate from IIT with her\nhead often in the clouds but her feet firmly on the ground (also the name of her blog), Lakshmi\nbrings warmth, humour, and heart to everything she writes. Her journey as a writer began early,\nwith her first piece published in Eve\u2019s Weekly while she was still in school.\nHer stories have since appeared in Femina, Woman\u2019s Era, Good Housekeeping, Today,\nWomen\u2019s Web, and Readomania, among others. She has also written books for children and\ncontributed to anthologies like Airavata: Elephant Tales. When not lost in words, Lakshmi can be\nfound teaching, volunteering, or reading \u2014 always finding joy in the journey rather than the\ndestination.\nShe slips in and out of teaching mode without warning. It was quite a relief to her children when\nshe took up assignments as a volunteer with Teach India.\nWhen she is not writing, she is reading for herself, and editing other people\u2019s works.\nFor her, the journey is more interesting than the destination.\nShe lives in the NCR.",
