DESCRIPTION:Rasas &amp\; Raagas: Art inspired Melodies is an immersive and interactive workshop that invites participants to explore the deep relationship between swar (musical notes)\, raaga (melodic framework)\, and rasa (emotional essence). \n\nWhat transforms this experience is its innovative dialogue with visual art. Participants will encounter the evocative modernist paintings of Ram Kumar\, allowing his abstract forms and colors to inspire spontaneous musical responses through voice\, breath\, and sound.\n\nBy placing music in conversation with visual imagery\, the workshop opens new pathways to experience both disciplines\, designed for musicians\, artists\, and anyone curious about the emotive power of the arts. No prior training in music is required—just a willingness to listen\, respond\, and discover the harmony between sound\, form\, and emotion.\n\nThis event is in conjunction with the exhibition\, Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.\n\nFacilitated by arts practitioners\, Responding to Art through the Arts aims to activate our galleries through a series of workshops that hold space for young people’s responses to artwork on display. \n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.
