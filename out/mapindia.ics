DESCRIPTION:What stories do footsteps tell? \n\nSpend your Friday evening unwinding with a Kannada film screening\, followed by a discussion with the filmmaker Babu Eshwar Prasad. Inspired by 12th century Kannada poet Allama Prabhu’s vachana\, the title ‘Hariva Nadige Maiyella Kaalu’ (A Running River is all Legs) encapsulates the theme of this film which focuses on the idea of motion and walking. The film is a meditation on the act of walking through the lives of three principal characters: Kumar\, a photojournalist disenchanted with his regular job\, visits different places seeking new sources of inspiration\; Neelu\, a salesgirl in a shoe shop with a set routine\, is only interested in watching people walk\; and Amaresha\, an elderly prisoner\, alleviates his feelings of confinement by walking to imagined places within his cell. \n\nThe camera follows the gaze of the characters\, trained to different directions\, in some cases the ground and in others the sky\, experiencing how they relate to the world around them\, the minute details they observe\, and their sense of time and place. Moving between dream and reality\, the film is an exploration of the inner and outer landscapes they encounter.\n\nThis screening is in conjunction with the exhibition\, We don't end at our edges.\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nImages courtesy: Moving Focus Pictures.

DESCRIPTION:Join artist\, curator and cultural thinker Suresh Jayaram and renowned Kannada filmmaker Girish Kasaravalli in an insightful conversation on the poetic and profound portrayals of women in Kasaravalli’s films. From Ghatashraddha and Thaayi Saheba\, to Dweepa and Kansemba Kudureyaneri\, women in his films are never peripheral. Rather\, the women play a central and resilient role set against the emotional\, social and political background of his films.\n\nThese backgrounds are crafted not just by dialogue\, but also through the cinematic language and grammar featuring silences and visual metaphors. Drawing from Jayaram’s background as a visual artist\, the talk will discuss how this cinematic grammar draws from other art forms of literature\, theatre and the visual arts. Together\, Kasaravalli and Jayaram will explore women’s quiet revolutions in his films\, discussing how they resist\, remember and reimagine the world.\n\nImage credits: S G Vasudev

They wove desire\, memory\, and meaning into the act of purchase. \n\nOur latest exhibition\, Ticket Tika Chaap\, explores these textile labels\, known as tikats (tickets)\, tikas or chaaps\, and their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in India.\n\nThis guided walk will also give you FREE access to the otherwise ticketed exhibition.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a reading and discussion session facilitated by two members of the Readers’ Bloc collective - Vidyasagar and Mathew Stefan Thomas.\n\nIn this session of Reader’s Bloc\, we will focus on Ajay Navaria’s powerful short story Subcontinent– a deeply personal exploration of caste discrimination set against the backdrop of a bustling metropolis. Its nuanced narrative reflects the protagonist’s inner turmoil as he deals with memories and trauma\, juxtaposed with the complexities of his present.\n\nAlongside this\, we will examine Mimi Mondal’s short fiction So It Was Foretold\, which portrays the layered struggles of a Dalit woman navigating life while carrying the emotional and social weight of her husband. Her rage and guilt create tension between them in this story about a family's hidden past and how a name is carried through generations.\n\nThe Reader’s Bloc is an online/IRL group of readers taking part in reading\, listening and sharing exercises around texts that help us learn more about ourselves\, the identities we share and the communities we live in.\n\nThis programme is exclusively for 18–25 year olds.\n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.

DESCRIPTION:Song and dance have been an integral part of Indian cinema following the release of the first ever Indian talkie\, Alam Ara (1931). As the talkies caught on\, songs were\,  more often than not\, the primary reason for a film's biggest 'repeat value' factor. Little wonder\, then\, that producers wanted to highlight the musical aspect of their movies as a marketing tool. These song booklets\, costing a few annas\, were sold in cinema halls during the intermission and were extremely popular among cinegoers at the time. \n\nSong booklets were nothing less than artworks in their own right. Within their layout\, they incorporated the film's poster on their cover\, a list of its cast and crew\, the synopsis of the story\, and the lyrics of all the songs in the film. The talk by Karan Bali will shed light on how song booklets continue to serve as a valuable resource when we revisit Indian cinema history\, and aid in filling up many gaps in our archival records and thereby present novel ways of reading the archive.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a book launch of Deevara Chittara - The Artform\, the People and their Culture. This is the very first book to archive and document Chittara and related depleting eco-friendly handicrafts.\n\nChittara paintings are an intricate geometrical artform practiced by the women of the Deevaru community in Karnataka. This folk art has become an integral part of their daily routines—it was never a profession\, but a practice that has artistic and socio-cultural value.\n\nThis book captures the lifestyle\, culture\, challenges and way forward of the Deevaru community. It talks of the various facets of the artform such as its symbolism\, use of natural materials\, the role of women in the arts\, its link to social customs like marriages and festivals.\n\nThe book launch panel features authors Geetha Bhat and Smita\, and Vishwanath in conversation with Sudha\, a Chittara artist from the Deevaru community. She will share her personal experiences of learning and practising the art\, its place in everyday life\, and what it means to uphold a cultural legacy that was never meant to be a profession\, but a deeply integral part of womanhood\, ritual\, and community. \n\nThis event will be in Kannada.
