DESCRIPTION:Commemorative postage stamp on general elections issued in 1967\, Image courtesy: Vikas Kumar\n\nPostage stamps might be threatening to become quaint relics from the past\, but for over a century and a half they were central to our imagination of long-distance communication. This talk will delve into the fascinating history of postal services in India and explore the world of postage stamps in independent India.\n\nJoin Vikas Kumar as he takes us through the history and composition of stamps in Indian postal history — from walking through MAP's exhibition Hello &amp\; Goodbye: Postcards from the Early 20th Century\, to designing stamps of your own.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Since the COVID lockdowns\, our physical and digital lives have become increasingly interconnected. 'Landscapes of the Phygital' is a talk that explores this intersection through the experiences of people with disabilities\, many of whom have used digital spaces in creative and innovative ways to build ‘level playing grounds’ for the wider community. These interactions have opened up new possibilities\, pathways and ways of being\, even as human existence has become threatened in new ways.\n\nIn collaboration with the Embassy of Switzerland India\, Swissnex in India\, Design Beku and Point of View\, this event allows you to dive deeper into the tangled terrains of identity\, belonging\, autonomy\, safety\, vulnerability\, design and self-determination through stories\, videos\, panels and conversations.

DESCRIPTION:Untitled (Landscape)\, 1950 by Gopal Ghose MAC.00165 — Image courtesy: MAP Collection\n\nLet's explore the skills we need to build the relationships we want in the worlds we dream.\n\nIn a world where disagreements\, conflicts\, and harms are inevitable\, how do we care for ourselves and each other? How do we move away from punishment and toward growth\, expansion\, and connection? What if we started creating a world where everyone has the skills to keep each other safe?\n\nThis three-part workshop series is an invitation to journey together\, equipping ourselves with tangible practices\, skills and lenses that are rooted in the anti-oppressive principles and values of restorative and transformative justice. These practices will not only help us address conflicts and harms in a nurturing way but also support us in building the kinds of relationships that can prevent violence and harm before they begin. We will start small and build from there.\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nIntroduction to RJ and TJ\nWe will ground ourselves in the foundational principles and frameworks of Restorative Justice (RJ) and Transformative Justice (TJ)\, tracing the roots and history of these practices and understanding their role in addressing conflict\, harm\, and abuse.\n\nEveryday Practices\nWe will explore how you likely already practise RJ and TJ in your everyday life\, and learn from strategies and experiments that already exist to apply these to the different relationships\, communities\, and organisations you are part of.\n\nSkill Practice\nIn this workshop series\, the intention is to embody and practice skill sets that deepen RJ and TJ practices and support responding to conflict\, harm\, and violence in our lives and relationships. In each session\, we will practise a specific skill with each other and strategize ways to strengthen these in our own lives.\n\nSession 1: Active Listening\nSaturday\, June 22\, 2024\, 10:30 am to 1:30 pm\n\nWe will explore the fundamentals of Active Listening\, understand its significance in deepening RJ and TJ practices\, and practise together to integrate Active Listening more deeply into our lives.\n\nSession 2: Self-Accountability\nSunday\, August 11\, 2024\, 10:30am to 1:30pm\n\nWe will explore the crucial role of accountability\, which has been at the heart of RJ &amp\; TJ work\, by going inwards - an internal resource that we must develop through regular practice.\n\nSession 3: Boundaries &amp\; Conflict Transformation\nSaturday\, October 19\, 2024\, 10:30am to 1:30pm\n\nWe will explore anti-oppressive approaches to conflict\, identify how we know\, communicate and hold our own boundaries\, and learn practical tools to navigate difficult conversations.\n\nYou can register for all three of the workshops. This is a closed workshop with limited availability. Selected participants will be contacted via email.\n\nThis event is part of the larger programming for the exhibition VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection.

DESCRIPTION:So many sounds\, words\, and ideas surround us everyday. If you want to bridge the gap between these three\, come and explore artist Hemant Sreekumar’s experimental audio performance at MAP. In this performance\, Hemant will use gerunds\, a part of English grammar\, and morph them using custom technology\, rhythms and parts of conventional music into pure signals.\n\nRegister to attend this free event at MAP and reflect through Hemant’s performance on the interplay between our language\, consciousness\, and entropy.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n- The performance may contain sharp unpredictable media that could be triggering for some.\n- Please exercise caution if you suffer from anxiety\, epilepsy\, or any other condition that maybe affected by extreme retinal and acoustic stimuli. If you feel uncomfortable\, please exit the performance immediately.
