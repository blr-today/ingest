DESCRIPTION:Click here for the schedule.\nRegistrations for this event are now closed.\nIf we imagine inclusion in the arts and cultural sector as a landscape we have been mapping intuitively—sometimes through deliberation and by asking important questions such as: Did we do our best to make access equal for all? Did we push through collaboratively? Did we slow down to listen and evolve? And when did we realise that the map itself needed to be redrawn?\n\nThe Inclusion Conference has always been MAP’s attempt to ask these questions openly. What began in 2023 as a gathering to think about accessibility in cultural organisations\, has grown into an annual space where practitioners\, educators\, activists\, artists\, and community leaders convene to reflect on inclusive practices that shape the art &amp\; cultural spaces. Not merely as a value\, but also a practice informed by the unique perspectives of historically marginalised and underrepresented communities.\n\nYear after year\, MAP’s Inclusion conference has examined these questions from different vantage points: First\, through the lens of funding\, then through the systems and structures that enable or restrict those opportunities. In this third edition\, we turn our attention to measurement not as a checkbox\, but as a way of understanding whether our intentions translate into meaningful change.\n\nTo explore this\, the conference brings together voices who work at the intersections of justice\, care\, community organising\, and cultural practice:\n- Through fireside conversations\, we unpack how identities shape our understanding of culture and belonging.\n- Workshops guide participants through nuances of recognising unconscious bias\, navigating conflict\, and cinema poster politics of caste and gender.\n- Case study labs offer a closer look at community-led art &amp\; cultural collectives\, accessible practice\, multilingual engagement\, and grassroots education\, urging us to reflect on what works\, and what must evolve.\n\nThrough the day\, participants are encouraged to question their assumptions and biases\, as well as rethink and reimagine their roles. The conference culminates with a performance rooted in lived histories at the margins\, through a Song of Ghetto by Jangama Collective.\n\nMAP’s aim is to continuously evolve\, learn and bring forth innovative\, inclusive practices. This conference is a gathering of those who believe that cultural spaces can be more inclusive\, more imaginative\, and more equitable and those who are willing to walk the talk of shaping that future together.\n\nThis year’s MAP’s 3rd Inclusion conference\, Beyond Headcount Diversity at MAP is supported by:\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nMAP’s Accessibility Partner \n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nInclusion Conference 2023\n\nInclusion Conference 2024

DESCRIPTION:It’s game time at Ticket Tika Chaap! Come and discover the art of Indo-British textile trademarks through riddles. This exhibition explores textile labels\, known as tikats (tickets)\, tikas or chaaps\, and their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in the 19th and 20th century global colonial market.\n\nIntricately designed\, these labels carry nuanced stories within them. This is your chance to decode its narrative—the more clues you find\, the closer you get to victory.

DESCRIPTION:Beauty in the broken. One of Red House's most popular engagements\, the Kintsugi workshop\, celebrates the Japanese philosophy and technique of repairing broken pottery with lacquer and powdered gold. \n\nIn this workshop\, participants are given whole ceramics\, which they break with a hammer\, and then rejoin. In the process\, participants learn that kintsugi goes beyond mere repair\; and that it is a profound philosophy and art form that promotes the appreciation of imperfections\, resilience\, and the beauty of the broken.

DESCRIPTION:Bharatanatyam is often called the dance of the cosmic god Nataraja in common parlance\, but a deeper look into history of the making of Bharatanatyam shows this narrative was engineered to erase the courtly origins of the dance form.\n\nNrithya Pillai's dance is about centering these erased hereditary histories—something she is a part of on account of her identity as being from these families whose performance was criminalised. The most common feature of “hereditary dance” is that the songs are themed around love\, and if there is one mythological figure who occupied a significant place in Bharatanatyam repertoire it was the God of Desire—Manmatha\, Maaran\, Kama\, Madhana.\n\nThis performance will showcase pieces from the hereditary repertoire that bring focus onto the themes of love\, and the poetic beauty of the imagery of how Manmatha is portrayed in these love songs.

DESCRIPTION:From dancing elephants and beloved deities to the surprising sight of steamships\, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery.\n\nTextile labels arrived in Indian markets in their thousands\, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India)\, and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire\, memory\, and meaning into the act of purchase. Join us for a guided walk of  our exhibition\, Ticket Tika Chaap\, to explore these textile labels\, their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in India.\n\n&nbsp\;
