DESCRIPTION:Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\, a Sanskrit phrase meaning “the world is family”\, is a universalist idea that competes with dominant\, exclusivist Hindu notions of caste. The director of the film\, Anand Patwardhan\, grew up in a milieu that questioned the latter. The family’s elders had fought for India’s Independence\, but had rarely spoken about it. ‘Liberty\, Equality\, Fraternity’\, words enshrined in India’s Constitution\, were subconsciously internalised.\n\nAs his parents aged\, Anand began to film with whatever equipment was at hand. Soon\, birthdays and family gatherings gave way to oral history. Revisiting home movie footage a decade after his parents had passed\, was a revelation. Today\, supremacist ideology has plagued and altered notions of democracy. As they rewrite India’s history\, memories of the past and the lessons they present us with have become more precious than mere personal nostalgia.\n\nJoin us for a screening of this award-winning documentary followed by a Q&amp\;A with the filmmaker.\n\nCredits:\n\n- Production\, Direction\, Editing: Anand Patwardhan\n- Camera and Sound: Anand Patwardhan\, Simantini Dhuru\n- Production Assistance: Simantini Dhuru\, Mohosin Shaikh

DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wanted to learn how exhibitions are curated for a museum or gallery? Then this hands-on curatorial workshop by Fulbright-Nehru scholar Julia Wintner is the perfect opportunity for you.\n\nCurating Is Mapping is a 6 hour\, hands-on curatorial workshop for both aspiring and experienced curators during which you will experience the full arc of the exhibition process: from initial concept and curatorial statement\, to digital presentation.\n\nMAP’s permanent exhibition VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection (currently on view) will serve as your prompt for curating. Julia will distribute selected images and texts to guide the attendees’ curatorial focus.\n\nWe will examine the range of critical curatorial tasks and how they affect curators’ relationships with both artists and spaces. We will explore these tasks with close attention to current social and cultural events. Once you register for the workshop\, we will share the workshop schedule and pre-workshop prompts to get you started!

DESCRIPTION:Do you ever feel alone\, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection\, even when it cracks a little? This is a performance piece that explores loneliness.\n\nThe Earthquake tells the story of two people. In their story\, the meaning of human connection\, loneliness\, and unspoken words hang heavy in the air.\n\nMathew and Sameer meet every week\, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. Yet\, the unspoken words scream louder than their spoken conversations. This story of cycles\, of coming together\, drifting apart\, and all the spaces in between\, is an adaptation of “Bhūmikampa – Das Erdbeben” which received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt München Kulturreferat (City of Munich).
