DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Tailor Made City\, Nagari 2021\nWhen livelihoods disappear and become stigmatised\, what happens?\n\nJoin us for a screening of Nagari films that look at various ways in which communities' livelihoods and living traditions are stripped\, held against\, or deemed obsolete.  This will be followed by a conversation between the Assistant Director Tanvi Karia from Charles Correa Foundation and filmmakers Nikki and Rajeev Malagi.\n\nAbout the films\n\n01. Olam I Chennai\n\nDirected by Priyadharshan Anand\, Nagendran Arumugam\, Arunmani Vasu and Dishon C Prince\, the film explores the tale of the Kosasthalai river. It is narrated by Kumaresan\, a native fisherman\, voicing for the land\, the people\, its flora and fauna.\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n02. The Bhavi Project I Bangalore\n\nBy Rajeev G Malagi and Smruti Balvalli\n\nThe ‘Bhavi project’ documents the changing narrative of open wells as physical systems of water storage and their association with communities. The film is developed on a fundamental premise: ‘What is the future of cities without open wells?’ \n\n&nbsp\;\n\n03. The Many Journeys of Water I Tiruchirapalli\n\nBy Niki Nirvikalpa\, Sugantha Priscilla and Prasanth Kumar K\n\nThe journey of water doesn’t end at the toilet when you flush it. The journey of ‘wastewater’ or sewage\, as it is now known\, begins here. \n\n&nbsp\;\n\n04. Tailor Made City I Bangalore\n\nBy Purna\, Himadri Das\, Arvind Dev\, Montry Thaalavattam\, Karthik Murali and Ravikumar A.S \n\nThree tailors who operate in very different spaces of the city\, yet they share the same set of skills. They have found ingenious ways to survive. This film traces those stories of self-respect and pride. The tailors are a tribe which contributes to the maintenance of the city and its people. They are omnipresent.\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n05. Darudi I Ahmedabad\n\nBy Atish Indrekar and Ruchika Chhara\n\n'दारुडी' (Darudi) is a word in the Bhantu language\, meaning 'liquor'. This film is about the Chhara community\, who are stigmatised as "criminals'' due to their tainted colonial history. Because of this existing historical stigma in society\, women of the Chhara tribe have to brew liquor as a part of their livelihood\, which is an act of prohibition/crime in the dry state of Gujarat. However\, there is a negligible section of the Chhara society which is involved with small businesses and is trying to emerge from their stigmatised life.\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n06. Cycle of Life I Nagpur\n\nBy Swanand Kottewar\, Rahul Jambhulkar\, Aniket Kolarkar &amp\; Sanket Ray\n\nThe cycle\, is often dismissed as a relic of the past\, has been an important means of mobility and livelihood for over a century. Cycle of Life is an intimate exploration of change witnessed through the life of Umesh Sarate\, an age-old cycle customer of Shinde Cycle Store\, in Nagpur. He travels to the city to buy wholesale goods from the local market\, as he rents a cycle from the store.

DESCRIPTION:Legendary filmmaker Girish Kasaravalli engages in a deep and wide-ranging conversation on the women who anchor his cinematic narratives\, with cultural critic Suresh Jayaram. The talk will focus on quiet revolutions which unfold in Kasaravalli’s films—Ghatashraddha\, Thaayi Saheba\, Dweepa and Kanasemba Kudureyaneri—where women are never peripheral but central to the narrative. \n\nTogether\, Kasaravalli and Jayaram will explore how these stories are crafted not just through dialogue\, but through silence\, visual metaphor\, and a cinematic grammar that draws from literature\, theatre\, and the visual arts. The event is being hosted in collaboration with Ananya Drushya.

DESCRIPTION:Image credits: Institut national du patrimoine/ E. Thyss\nWe've all been there\, finding that old family photo tucked away in a drawer\, only to discover it's starting to fade\, crack\, or yellow. Those irreplaceable moments with loved ones\, and memories captured are slowly disappearing.\nThe truth is\, photographs are fragile. Heat\, humidity\, light\, and even the way we store them can cause damage that sometimes can't be undone. But here's the good news\, you don't need to be a professional to protect your photo collection!\n\nIn this talk\, Chloe Lucas\, a professional conservator will inform us of some preventive conservation actions that can be easily taken and implemented in a personal and private context to improve the long-term preservation of private photographic collections.
