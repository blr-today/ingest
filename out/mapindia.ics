This Sasken exhibition offers a sneak peek into this exquisite collection.\n\nThe exhibition focuses on the journey from the earliest twisted fibers to finished garments\, inviting us to view cloth as a manifestation of rhythm\, logic\, and human intelligence woven into form. Each piece tells a story of cultural heritage\, where ancient techniques meet contemporary inspiration\, and every thread connects us to the hands that shaped it.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Rasas &amp\; Raagas: Art inspired Melodies is an immersive and interactive workshop that invites participants to explore the deep relationship between swar (musical notes)\, raaga (melodic framework)\, and rasa (emotional essence). \n\nWhat transforms this experience is its innovative dialogue with visual art. Participants will encounter the evocative modernist paintings of Ram Kumar\, allowing his abstract forms and colors to inspire spontaneous musical responses through voice\, breath\, and sound.\n\nBy placing music in conversation with visual imagery\, the workshop opens new pathways to experience both disciplines\, designed for musicians\, artists\, and anyone curious about the emotive power of the arts. No prior training in music is required—just a willingness to listen\, respond\, and discover the harmony between sound\, form\, and emotion.\n\nThis event is in conjunction with the exhibition\, Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.\n\nFacilitated by arts practitioners\, Responding to Art through the Arts aims to activate our galleries through a series of workshops that hold space for young people’s responses to artwork on display. \n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.

DTSTAMP:20250917T091322Z
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a walkthrough of our permanent exhibition with Senior Archivist at the Archives at NCBS\, Anjali Ramachandran.\n\nWhen we encounter artworks at a museum\, we make meaning either through the work itself\, its setting\, or through labels that accompany them. Another way to read an artwork is to look for what's not in the 'frame'—to explore the circumstances of its creation and the use of the artwork\, rather than just the artwork itself.\n\nIn this guided walk\, you will get to explore our permanent exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women through the MAP Collection\, through the lens of an archivist. We will discuss the maker\, the purpose\, a specific object's relation to others\, and the broader social and historical environment in which the artworks were created. In archival sciences\, this is called contextualisation\, where archivists understand records through the varied ways in which memories (remembered or in recorded acts) have been transmitted over time and space with numerous inscriptions\, transmissions\, and omissions.\n\nAlthough it sounds technical\, the process itself can be disruptive and playful. It involves gossip\, peeking behind the curtain\, and an understanding of the complex process of making art!

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a guided walk through our digital textile exhibition\, exploring how cloth serves as an expression of human creativity and cultural connection. Textiles are among the oldest human inventions\, yet they remain endlessly renewed. To bind\, dye\, and transform cloth is a shared tradition of creativity—reminding us that making is also a way of becoming.\n\n'Bound Together' is exhibition presents the Haveli collection (1984–2016) by designer Poornima Jain\, where influences from India\, Japan\, and Africa were reimagined into a modern language of abstraction. The works appear in dialogue with the cultural traditions that shaped them—bandhani\, leheriya\, shibori\, and Kuba cloths—tracing connections across geographies while celebrating the singularity of each textile.
