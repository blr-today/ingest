DESCRIPTION:From dancing elephants and beloved deities\, to the surprising sight of steamships\, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery.\n\nTextile labels arrived in Indian markets in the thousands\, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India)\, and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire\, memory\, and meaning into the act of purchase. \n\nOur latest exhibition\, Ticket Tika Chaap\, explores these textile labels\, and their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in India. Join us for an exciting walkthrough of Ticket\, Tika\, Chaap with artist and printmaker Jayasimha Chandrasekhar where he shares his unique insights as a printmaker. This will be followed by an in-depth presentation on the same.

DESCRIPTION:Do you sometimes feel like everything is happening all at once and there’s no better way to describe it other than absolute chaos? That's how Laetitia felt on 6 May 2012\, the day of the second round of the French presidential election. Join us for a film screening of Age of Panic/La Bataille de Solférino\, a french comedy film directed by Justine Triet. The film is about a frazzled young mother who navigates the homefront during a pivotal moment in French politics. This screening will be followed by a discussion.\n\nThis film is in collaboration with the Alliance Francaise Bangalore and part of our series Femme: Beneath the surface\, which aims to spotlight an emerging generation of French storytellers\, each dissecting characters that embody the idea of the woman - layered\, disoriented and probing. Set against the backdrop of contemporary France - where questions of class\, identity\, and belonging remain urgent and unresolved - these films trace the quiet resistance and raw introspection of women thrown into complex situations. This series aims to engage with younger audiences who see through facades\, question structure\, and crave stories that don’t look away from the fractures beneath the surface.\n\nThis film will be screened in French with English subtitles.

DESCRIPTION:An immersive techno-ritual unlike any other. Join us for a performance by Dominique Savitri Bonarjee as she presents "How to Dream a Rasa Machine\," a sensuous journey into sound\, movement\, and the subtle energies of our world. Structured as an electrifying jam session\, blending electronic and acoustic textures with embodied dance\, this performance is deeply inspired by the intricacies of Indian rasa. At its heart lies a handcrafted copper sound suit\, a revolutionary instrument that translates the performer’s every motion and environmental nuances – gravity\, air\, humidity – into a rich sonic landscape.\n\nIn Indian aesthetics\, rasa refers to the spiritual pleasure of deep immersion in experience. Here\, the audience encounters rasa through the sensuous materiality of the instrument\, and a spectral soundscape that induces a collective dream-space. \n\nThis is followed by ‘Butoh\, as Heard by a Dancer’\, book presentation.
