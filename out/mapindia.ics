DESCRIPTION:If we imagine inclusion in the arts and cultural sector as a landscape we have been mapping intuitively—sometimes through deliberation and by asking important questions such as: Did we do our best to make access equal for all? Did we push through collaboratively? Did we slow down to listen and evolve? And when did we realise that the map itself needed to be redrawn?\n\nThe Inclusion Conference has always been MAP’s attempt to ask these questions openly. What began in 2023 as a gathering to think about accessibility in cultural organisations\, has grown into an annual space where practitioners\, educators\, activists\, artists\, and community leaders convene to reflect on inclusive practices that shape the art &amp\; cultural spaces. Not merely as a value\, but also a practice informed by the unique perspectives of historically marginalised and underrepresented communities.\n\nYear after year\, MAP’s Inclusion conference has examined these questions from different vantage points: First\, through the lens of funding\, then through the systems and structures that enable or restrict those opportunities. In this third edition\, we turn our attention to measurement not as a checkbox\, but as a way of understanding whether our intentions translate into meaningful change.\n\nTo explore this\, the conference brings together voices who work at the intersections of justice\, care\, community organising\, and cultural practice:\n- Through fireside conversations\, we unpack how identities shape our understanding of culture and belonging.\n- Workshops guide participants through nuances of recognising unconscious bias\, navigating conflict\, and cinema poster politics of caste and gender.\n- Case study labs offer a closer look at community-led art &amp\; cultural collectives\, accessible practice\, multilingual engagement\, and grassroots education\, urging us to reflect on what works\, and what must evolve.\n\nThrough the day\, participants are encouraged to question their assumptions and biases\, as well as rethink and reimagine their roles. The conference culminates with a performance rooted in lived histories at the margins\, through a Song of Ghetto by Janagama collective.\n\nMAP’s aim is to continuously evolve\, learn and bring forth innovative\, inclusive practices. This conference is a gathering of those who believe that cultural spaces can be more inclusive\, more imaginative\, and more equitable and those who are willing to walk the talk of shaping that future together.\n\nThis year’s MAP’s 3rd Inclusion conference\, Beyond Headcount Diversity at MAP is supported by:\n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nMAP’s Accessibility Partner \n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nInclusion Conference 2023\n\nInclusion Conference 2024

DESCRIPTION:The songbook of Sophia Elizabeth Plowden\, with lyrics of Rekhtah ghazal by Asaf al-Dawlah\, Nawab of Avadh and Punjabi tappah\, ink\, opaque watercolours\, and gold on paper\, Lucknow\, India\, 1787-88\, © Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge.\nA Mughal Songbook: Art\, Music and Empire\, is an upcoming display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. It reveals the intricate pages of the illustrated songbook\, which is a book that gave rise to a cross-cultural appreciation of Hindustani music. \n\nContaining seventy-seven songs written in Persian\, Urdu\, Classical Hindi\, and Punjabi\, this manuscript oﬀers a window into the visual and performing arts of late Mughal South Asia\, illuminating the relationships between singers\, dancers\, courtesans\, poets\, and the books and objects they cherished. \n\nAt the core of A Mughal Songbook is the story of Sophia Elizabeth Plowden (1751–1834)\, and her exquisite book of lyrics and music notation\, dated 1787–88. In it\, Plowden recorded and illustrated the music she encountered in North Indian courtly gatherings during a period of transition between the Mughal and British Empires. \n\nThe illustrated songbook ultimately gave rise to the colonial phenomenon of ‘Hindustani Airs’ – Hindustani songs adapted and performed by British elites on the harpsichord. This talk will give audiences a sneak peek at this upcoming exhibition and re-enliven the sensory world of Islamic and South Asian art\, evoking the sounds\, images\, and textures emerging from late Mughal culture.\n\nThis event is in collaboration with Art\, Resources and Teaching Trust.
