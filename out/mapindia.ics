DESCRIPTION:How can the work of Krishna Reddy inspire your own artistic journey? Find out at our live sketching session that explores his work through the exhibition Rhyme Unbroken — Krishna Reddy as Artist and Perpetual Student.\nKrishna Reddy's prints are mesmerising\, like little cobwebs of lightning running through rich\, granulated streams of colour. During this workshop\, we will try to understand Krishna Reddy's unique prints and practice through explorations of our own.  Going beyond the simple viewing of these prints\, this session provides an opportunity to perceive them in a new light in the drawings that you create.\nWhat to bring along:\n\n- A small sketchbook that you can easily hold when walking around the museum\, ideally A5 or A4\, with a hardbound cover.\n\n- A pencil\, ideally 2b or 4b.\n\n- Oil\, Wax or Pastel crayons-even student grade crayons will do. Also remember to bring along a scraper - perhaps a piece of an old credit card\, or a tiny flat piece of metal or plastic.\n\nThis workshop is open to 16 year olds and above.
