DESCRIPTION:There is art hidden everywhere\, and when you view it with an artist's vision\, it suddenly becomes evident\, as if it had been in plain sight all along. Discover the stories that can be found within a piece of wood by closely examining artworks at our latest exhibition Painting with Fire\, and join us for a sketching workshop led by Penciljam.\n\nPainting with Fire\, features the art of Jeram Patel and Tarik Currimbhoy\, who both use fire on wood to present the unique possibilities  concealed within pieces of wood.\n\nThis method of creating art can be seen in light of what may stem from the material or process. Some sculptors\, for instance\, describe their process as chipping away at marble to reveal the sculpture hidden inside or game artists who build characters starting from random squiggles of ink.\n\nIn this session\, we will explore this unique human ability to create meaningful forms and interpretations out of seemingly random shapes. We will discover how artistic vision utilises both chance and skill to create art.\n\n\nWhat you need to Bring along\n\n- A sketchbook\n- A Black Gel Pen / Micron / Pigment Liner\n- A Black Brush Pen (Optional)\n\nIf you would like to register for our 12:00PM session click here.

CATEGORIES:Panel Discussion,MAP
DTSTAMP:20240917T110528Z
DESCRIPTION:How can a sense of agency\, care and respect influence the experience of childbirth? This panel discussion explores the importance of respect and dignity in maternal healthcare\, focusing on the experiences of women during pregnancy and childbirth in India. \n\nThe artwork Mother and Child 2 by Nilima Sheikh offers a powerful visual representation of the maternal experience. It depicts a mother and her newborn\, appearing as if they were drawn with a single\, continuous line. The larger series that this painting is a part of\, captures moments of the mother holding\, nursing\, and steadying her child – telling of the deep bond between them. However\, the subtle hints of wounds and tears on the mother's body in this painting remind us of the physical and emotional challenges women face during childbirth.\n\nJoin us for a discussion that delves into the current state of maternal care\, addressing the challenges that women face in healthcare settings and the stigma that surrounds their experiences in the maternal healthcare landscape. This discussion will cover public and private sectors but with a special focus on public sector hospitals.\n\nOur panellists\, Dr Janhavi Nilekani\, Mandira Kalra Kalaan\, and Jamuna L\, will be in conversation with Anoushaka Chandrashekar. They will also address the role of advocacy\, awareness\, and outreach in transforming maternity care practices.\n\nThis event is conceptualised under our exhibition VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection.
