DESCRIPTION:Untitled\, 2008 by T.N. Upendranath MAC.00043 from MAP Archives\n\nThis Pride month\, MAP in collaboration with Piravi Art Community is hosting a workshop and poetry showcase as part of the programme series Redefining Queerscapes.\n\nIn times of distress and chaos\, how do you find hope\, support\, solidarity\, expression\, joy and celebration? Poetry can be a resource and respite. Join us as we create a safe container to welcome our authentic expressions and support each other in claiming-reclaiming-celebrating our beautiful selves through the craft of poetry. We will invite explorations of gender\, sexuality\, disability\, distress\, grief\, solidarity and more in an immersive way working with mindfulness and presence-oriented practices\, writing prompts\, group sharing\, blackout poetry and more.\n\nFollowing the workshop\, we are inviting published poets from the queer community in Bangalore and the workshop participants to perform their pieces as part of Shabda - an open mic for LGBTQIA+ peeps as part of the Namma Pride events. There will be a five-minute slot for each performer. Additionally\, the showcase is a free-to-participate event but requires interested poets to share their pieces with us in advance. We welcome poetry across genres and languages!\n\nNote: This workshop is for LGBTQIA+ individuals only. The workshop is followed by a poetry showcase which is open to allies as well.\n\nThis workshop will be facilitated by Raju Behara and SG Aishwarya from Piravi Art Community. The poetry showcase will be facilitated by Rohini Malur from Shabda.

DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wanted to learn how exhibitions are curated for a museum or gallery? Then this hands-on curatorial workshop by Fulbright-Nehru winning art curator Julia Wintner is the perfect opportunity for you.\n\nCurating Is Mapping is a 6 hour\, hands-on curatorial workshop for both aspiring and experienced curators during which you will experience the full arc of the exhibition process: from initial concept and curatorial statement\, to digital presentation.\n\nMAP’s permanent exhibition VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection (currently on view) will serve as your prompt for curating. Julia will distribute selected images and texts to guide the attendees’ curatorial focus.\n\nWe will examine the range of critical curatorial tasks and how they affect curators’ relationships with both artists and spaces. We will explore these tasks with close attention to current social and cultural events. Once you register for the workshop\, we will share the workshop schedule and pre-workshop prompts to get you started!

DESCRIPTION:With Love N. I\, 1977\, Manjit Bawa\n\nThe Reader's Bloc is an online/IRL group of readers taking part in reading\, listening and sharing exercises around texts that help us learn more about ourselves\, the identities we share and the communities we live in.\n\nFor our upcoming session\, we will be thinking about all the different ways we look at care and the nuances of caring for someone. This month we will look at two texts\, the lovely personal essay "Super Fandom" by Ragini Rao Nag where she explores the communities of care she created by being part of a fandom and the wonderful short story "What is Seized" by Lorrie Moor which looks at the ways in which act of caring shapes our being. Once you register for the event\, we will send you the text and the topics/themes we will discuss.\n\nThis programme is exclusively for 18–25 year olds.\n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.
