DESCRIPTION:Join us for an immersive workshop exploring the intersection of new media\, cinema and generative art with artist and filmmaker Koel Sen. This session will provide an overview of historical and contemporary experiments of using new media in film. \n\nThis one-day session is designed to explore how filmmakers and artists utilise film\, video\, and digital media to push the boundaries of moving images\, with a special emphasis on computational art in cinema. Focusing on personal and poetic filmmaking\, in this session we will create and deconstruct images with the help of computer software and hardware and incorporate music and sound as catalysts\, drawing on memory and perception to guide our creative process. Through collaboration\, we will produce video loops that can be seamlessly edited into film and sonic sequences\, ultimately expanding our exploration of this dynamic medium.\n\nThis session is perfect for those interested in the convergence of art\, technology\, and cinema\, offering both theoretical insights and practical engagement. Get hands-on with generative art through a beginner’s exercise in coding using "Gibber\," a browser-based app that makes generative coding accessible to everyone. Additionally\, experience a live demonstration of creative tools like Resolume and MIDI controllers to see how technology is used in contemporary audiovisual performance.\n\nParticipants are welcome to bring along their personal archives in the form of home videos\, family photos\, mobile phone footage and/or any moving image material of their choice. A prior/basic understanding of filmmaking and film editing will be useful. Participants must carry their laptops with some basic film editing software. (Eg. Adobe Premiere Pro or Da Vinci Resolve). Limited seats are available\, please register to secure your spot!

DESCRIPTION:Attend the book launch of The Memory Keepers and Future Seekers by Ulka Chauhan and Samira Sheth.\n\nFeaturing six heritage homes\, this book explores themes of architecture\, culture\, heritage\, anthropology\, identity and belonging. It features photographs by Chauhan and text by Sheth and includes visual and literary portraits of Goa’s 300+ year old heritage homes\, attempting to present their untold stories through a series of in-depth interviews with the home owners. A layered narrative\, the book brings to light the stories of families and their fragments of memories while touching upon the historical\, cultural\, political\, social and religious moments that shaped Goa. \n\nIn conversation with architect Robert Stephens\, the two authors discuss their process\, insights from their experience of putting this book together\, and the relevance of looking at heritage through multiple lenses\; as much personal\, as historical and monumental.

DESCRIPTION:This weekend\, travel back to the seventies and enjoy Awtar Krishna Kaul’s 27 Down\, a 1974 drama based on the Hindi novel Athara Sooraj Ke Paudhe. The film is centred around Sanjay\, a railway employee who is battling between his duty towards his authoritarian father and his desire for freedom. 27 Down is popular for its unique cinematography\, themes of societal expectations\, pursuit of dreams and self-discovery.\n\nThis film screening is the second in our six-month long series\, ‘The Radical Seventies’\, a collaboration between MAP and Bangalore Film Forum\, co-curated by Ashish Rajadhyaksha. \n\nThis series has been conceptualised as part of MAP’s youth engagement programming.\n\nThe Radical Seventies is a series that is specially crafted for youth to engage with older classics that resonate with our contemporary times\, in familiar and unexpected ways. Through the 1970s\, Indian cinema saw several major experiments in cinema — often made in direct conversation with radical politics. The decade began in the late 1960s and spilled over into the early 1980s. With 27 Down\, we embark on another chapter of this journey\, exploring questions around evolving identities\, migration\, and the push and pull between independence\, empowering anonymity and the loneliness of the urban experience.
