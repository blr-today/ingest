DESCRIPTION:Fragments of unfinished verses swirl in an orbit\, finding their way to each other\, bewitched. They dance for a while\, hand in hand\, and then drop to the ground- to catch a breath\, a smile\, a moment in time\; to sit together. Content. Then they get up to dance again before they say their goodbyes.\n\nImages from the past\, present and future\, all collide to construct wild imaginations. Colors form\, hide and show. Pass through images\, like shadows of clouds. Fleeting. They meet each other in dark alleys\, and kiss\, and melt. Like a flirt with the mysticism of cinema.\n\nUsing two 16mm projectors with a live projectionist-performer\, this performance explores visual juxtapositions and photochemical experiments\, blending theatre\, mechanics\, and chemistry into a playful exploration of what film can be.\n\nPerformed by Karan Suri Talwar\nMusic by Baan\n\nHarkat Crew for Sound and Additional Visuals: Tanvi Chitre\, Keyuri Bhogale \nOriginally devised with Namrata and Simran\, Harkat Lab.

DESCRIPTION:Work hands-on with 16mm film in this tactile exploration of analog cinema. Using found footage as your raw material\, you'll learn to cut\, splice\, and manipulate existing imagery to create something entirely new.\n\nThis workshop introduces fundamental analog techniques—from physical film editing to creative projection methods—while exploring how appropriation and abstraction can breathe new life into archival images. You'll experiment with projection as both a screening method and a creative tool in its own right.\n\nThe workshop culminates in a collaborative expanded cinema performance\, where all participants will present their collective 16mm work.\n\nThis workshop is part of Collection (film ephemera) programming

DESCRIPTION:In this session of Reader’s Bloc\, we’ll explore two texts—The Book of Everlasting Things by Aanchal Malhotra and Smell by Radhika Jha—both exploring smell as not just a sense\, but as a conduit for memory\, love\, identity and belonging. \n\nMalhotra’s The Book of Everlasting Things follows a perfume maker in pre-partition India\, where different scents become the legacy passed through generations\, carrying with it familial love and a lot of history\; while Jha’s Smell\, tells the story of a young brown woman who navigates identity and alienation in postcolonial\, diasporic France. \n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.
