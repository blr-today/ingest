DESCRIPTION:In collaboration with Bangalore Film Forum (BFF)\, MAP is thrilled to present the screening of Interview\, a groundbreaking 1971 Bengali film directed by renowned filmmaker Mrinal Sen. This will be followed by a conversation between film critic Srikanth Srinivasan and film historian Ashish Rajadhyaksha.\n\nInterview is a unique film that delves into the colonial hangover\, anti-establishment sentiments\, middle-class cowardice\, and unemployment. The film\, which marked the debut of Ranjit Mallick\, was both a commercial and critical success\, praised for its innovative narrative and cinematic techniques.\n\nThe Radical Seventies is a series that is specially crafted for youth to engage with older classics that resonate with our contemporary times\, in familiar and unexpected ways. Through the 1970s\, Indian cinema saw several major experiments in cinema — often made in direct conversation with radical politics. The decade began in the late 1960s and spilled over into the early 1980s. While the distinct look of such a cinema may well have been inaugurated in Mrinal Sen’s celebrated Calcutta trilogy\, similar tendencies are parallelly in evidence in other Indian cities around the same time.\n\nThis film screening is the first of our six-month long series\, ‘The Radical Seventies’\, part of our youth engagement programming for AUD/VID which is a collaboration between MAP and Bangalore Film Forum and co-curated by Ashish Rajadhyaksha.\n\nIn collaboration with: \nNFDC-National Film Archive of India (NFAI)\n\nImage credit: https://www.mrinalsen.org/
