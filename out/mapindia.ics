DESCRIPTION:Join us for a delightful talk that unravels the enchanting world of ‘Colchas\,’ exquisite embroidered textiles from the MAP collection! Colchas are decorative textiles\, often characterized by elaborate embroidery or stitching\, that originated in Portugal and were later embraced and transformed in Latin America. The term "colcha" translates to "bedspread" or "coverlet\," and these textiles were traditionally used as bed coverings or wall hangings. \n\nGuided by textile collector Jeevak Parpia\, this session promises to take you on a journey through the intricate visual storytelling that defines these extraordinary artifacts. Discover the unique motifs woven into each ‘colcha’\, and their deep cultural and historical resonance. \n\nWith his wealth of expertise\, Mr. Parpia will talk on the artistic traditions and cross-cultural exchanges that shaped these textiles\, tracing their roots from Portugal to Latin America\, how colchas became a canvas for storytelling\, reflecting the lives\, beliefs\, and aspirations of their makers.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a the book launch of historian Anirudh Kanisetti's latest book\, Lords of Earth and Sea which explores the fascinating history of the Chola Empire.\n\nEmerging from the Kaveri floodplains in the 9th century CE\, the Chola dynasty became a dominant force in South India and beyond. Known for their architectural achievements\, such as grand temples\, their maritime influence\, and cultural contributions\, the Cholas left a lasting legacy on India and the wider region.\n\nKanisetti’s work brings to light the lives of not only the rulers but also the everyday people who shaped and lived through this era. Using inscriptions and historical records\, he separates fact from legend\, offering a nuanced view of this influential dynasty.\n\nThis book was made possible through a research grant provided to the author by the MAP Academy. The MAP Academy develops and provides open-access resources on the art and cultural histories of South Asia. Their digital offerings — including an encyclopedia of art\, online courses\, and several grants and special projects — encourage greater engagement with the region’s visual arts.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an essay filmmaking workshop with Falana Films\, where they will introduce you to the essay film format and guide you in developing a short film (one to three minutes) while working with an archive.\n\nIn making your essay film\, you will have access to a curated set of artworks from the MAP Collection\, as well as a resource list of museum and other institutional archives available in the public domain. Additionally\, you will be prompted to bring your own archival material–found footage\, home videos\, family photographs\, long-lost audio recordings\, and any A/V material you feel is at the cusp of telling a story. You will also be encouraged to film additional footage throughout the workshop.\n\nThis four-day workshop extends across two weekends–February 15–16 &amp\; 22–23. Teams of four will be selected based on themes chosen by participants when they register for the workshop. These teams alongside the Falana team will work together to make the film.\n\nThe focus of this workshop is not as much on the technical aspects of filmmaking as it is on the meaning one can make from scattered archives when thematically exploring them. \n\nExpanding on the thematic concerns of MAP’s permanent exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection you can find the list of themes for the workshop below:\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n- Body as Landscape: Gender Identity\, Sexuality and Body-politics\n\n- Home and Away: Memory\, Migration and Nostalgia\n\n- No Person’s Land: Cities and Spaces \n\n- ‘Mad or What?’: Mental Health and the City\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nRegister soon as seats are limited.\n\nRead this document to find out more about the workshop\, FAQs and a tentative schedule.
