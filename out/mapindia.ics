DESCRIPTION:A warm invitation to all neurodivergent and queer Folks!\nJoin us for the 4th edition of NeuroQueer Brain Box facilitated by Mani Agarwal\, a NeuroQueer therapist. This session will celebrate the diversity and stories of our bodies. Together\, we will explore how our bodies are integral to our identities.\nWe’ll begin with a guided walk of the exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE:Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection\, through a queer lens. As you move through the space\, reflect on some words that come up for you\; let them resonate with you\, and bring them into our group space. Together\, through shared reflections and queer perspectives on our bodies\, we’ll map our feelings with art. This will be a space to celebrate neuroqueer creativity and build a sense of community\, where we spend time with our own bodies to feel seen and affirmed. \nPlease note: This is a free session exclusively for individuals who identify as LGBTQIA+ or are individuals with ADHD/Autism/AuDHD.

DESCRIPTION:In an age of instant messages and disappearing stories\, the play "Love Letters: Ninna Preetiya Naanu" invites you to pause\, reflect\, and turn the pages of the past—one heartfelt letter at a time.\n\nThis poignant\, original Kannada play explores the depth of a lifelong connection between two people bound by nostalgia\, affection\, and all the words left unsaid. Imagine scrolling through a lifetime of messages—not through DMs\, but through yellowing pages\, hurried handwriting\, and tear-stained notes. From scribbled notes in school notebooks to confessions that arrive too late\, the play spans decades of friendship and almost-love.\n\nIt's a journey through innocence\, longing\, and the quiet ache of missed chances—narrated through letters that become both a timeline and a testament to what was\, and what might have been.\n\nThis performance is in conjunction with the exhibition Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.
