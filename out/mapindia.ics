DESCRIPTION:In this session of Reader’s Bloc\, we’ll explore two texts—The Book of Everlasting Things by Aanchal Malhotra and Smell by Radhika Jha—both exploring smell as not just a sense\, but as a conduit for memory\, love\, identity and belonging. \n\nMalhotra’s The Book of Everlasting Things follows a perfume maker in pre-partition India\, where different scents become the legacy passed through generations\, carrying with it familial love and a lot of history\; while Jha’s Smell\, tells the story of a young brown woman who navigates identity and alienation in postcolonial\, diasporic France. \n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.

DESCRIPTION:In an age of instant messages and disappearing stories\, the play "Love Letters: Ninna Preetiya Naanu" invites you to pause\, reflect\, and turn the pages of the past—one heartfelt letter at a time.\n\nThis poignant\, original Kannada play explores the depth of a lifelong connection between two people bound by nostalgia\, affection\, and all the words left unsaid. Imagine scrolling through a lifetime of messages—not through DMs\, but through yellowing pages\, hurried handwriting\, and tear-stained notes. From scribbled notes in school notebooks to confessions that arrive too late\, the play spans decades of friendship and almost-love.\n\nIt's a journey through innocence\, longing\, and the quiet ache of missed chances—narrated through letters that become both a timeline and a testament to what was\, and what might have been.\n\nThis performance is in conjunction with the exhibition Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.
