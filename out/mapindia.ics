DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Tram Theatre Trust\n\nDig your hands into clay\, and craft your own clay dolls! Come over to MAP\, spend time exchanging stories and experiences with professional clay doll artists from the Sunderbans\, and learn more about this indigenous craft form.\n\nHandmade dolls\, particularly clay doll-making\, have a deep relevance in human life. They strengthen connections with the natural and social environment\, reinforce relationships\, impart values and skills\, fire the creative gene\, and build a kinship between the mundane\, the mythical and the spiritual. This practice is a deeply relaxing and therapeutic process.\n\nExplore this historic craft form in this guided clay-doll making workshop with Dinesh Mondal and Ranajeet Sarkar from Manmathanagar. Generational and first-generation artists here create dolls that depict everything from fierce man-eating creatures of the Sunderbans\, everyday lives of their people\, to episodes from local folk-legends like Bonbibi and DokkhinRai. Become a part of this rich world\, and take home your own Sunderbans clay doll!\n\nPlease note: There are two sessions of this workshop. Please choose the session you want to attend on the registration link at the top of the page. Here are the dates and timings of the sessions:\n\n- Saturday\, July 5 (10:00 am - 1:00pm)\n\n- Sunday\, July 6 (10:00 am - 1:00pm)

DESCRIPTION:Enter a world steeped in tradition\, and a craft that dates back to thousands of years!\n\nPutul Katha is a special showcase that invites audiences to explore the practice of doll-making in West Bengal and the cultural heritage of this unique art form. These one-of-a-kind dolls were created by artists with almost every material available to them—from clay\, leaves and wood\, to metal\, glass\, fabric\, and more. The makers’ of these artefacts were not just limited to individual artists\, but included families and even entire villages or communities\, each with their own creative expression and heritage.\n\nKnown as putul in Bengali\, they not only serve as objects of play\, worship and decoration\, they are also bearers of stories. Shaped by the artists\, they carry their makers’ beliefs\, histories\, cultural knowledge and their everyday lives.\n\nJoin us to discover the unique history of these objects and the rich stories they tell.\n\nPutul Katha is accompanied by the following events:\n- Clay Doll-Making with Sunderbans Doll Artists\n- Maati Katha (Earth Stories) – An Object &amp\; Material Theatre Performance\n\nThis showcase is based on ongoing research by the Tram Arts Trust on the stories surrounding the doll arts of West Bengal.

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Shishir Jha\n\nIn an uranium mining area of Jharkhand\, India\, an indigenous couple copes with the loss of their daughter. For them\, the land and forest bear witness to their daughter’s memory. With great sensitivity and beauty\, the film explores the deeply intertwined connections between indigenous communities and the forest that is their traditional home. Deftly interweaving the vivid colours of their festivals\, folk songs\, and the sense of community that binds them together\, 'Tortoise Under The Earth' is a poetic elegy to a world that is rapidly disappearing\, subsumed by unchecked development and displacement.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Prajwal Gowda\n\n“400 islands across a watery world scattered!”\n\nA region of extreme ecological and environmental vulnerability\, the Sunderbans is a vast forested delta area in West Bengal and Bangladesh where great rivers combine and split\, before merging into the Bay of Bengal. In this dangerous and magical land\, living is about a fragile balance between land and water\, forest and field\, domestic and wild\, human and human\, human and non-human\, calm and storm. As each stakes claim\, as each encroaches upon the other’s space\, how does life manage to thrive?\n\nStories and beliefs form essential anchors for the people of the Sunderbans\, with the ‘Bonbibi’ legend looming large in the popular imagination. Bonbibi is said to have come to the ‘Land of the 18 Tides’ to help the people\, the tigers\, the deer\, the crabs\, the trees—all beings that cohabit the land. But\, only if we agree to the land's terms. And when she looks away\, devastation follows! Episodes from this legend\, as well as everyday aspects of Sunderbans life\, are depicted by the traditional and contemporary doll-makers of Sunderbans.\n\nMaati Katha (Earth Stories) brings these dolls—originally used for worship\, child’s play and display—into the theatre for the first time\, combining these art and craft traditions with contemporary object and material theatre practices. The play brings alive the Sunderbans through these clay dolls and the shape-shifting ‘maati’ (clay\, mud\, soil\, earth\, land)\, that not only forms the dolls\, but also defines the land and grounds the philosophy of the region. In doing so\, Maati Katha invites us to celebrate human resilience in the midst of fragility—a resilience that enables diverse communities to hold together through repeated upheavals of natural calamity and human violence. Bonbibi’s philosophy reigns\, “You are all connected: the crocodile\, the tiger\, water\, forest\, land\, all human beings … All!”\n\n&nbsp\;

Image courtesy of Marc Ohrem-Leclef (2018).\n\nThis event brings community organisers\, academics\, and activists together in conversation about how the worlds of queer-and-trans community-building\, knowledge production and information dissemination\, and progressive social change\, intersect. The panelists share a unique connection with QAMRA (Queer Archive for Memory\, Reflection\, and Activism)\, an autonomous community archive at the National Law School of India University in Bengaluru. Through their lightning talks and a moderated roundtable\, they will reflect on the past\, present\, and future of queer and trans* cultural organising\, involving distinct forms of resistance and joy.\n\n*(*) In Trans acknowledges the diversity of gender identities and expressions beyond the binary\, reflecting the inclusive scope of this conversation.
