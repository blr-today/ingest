DESCRIPTION: Image credits: Jugaad Co. \n\nWe go through life oblivious to the wondrous things we do and the magical beings we are. The fact is there’s magic all around us and there’s magic in us. People who love\, do things for us\, even if it makes them uncomfortable - even though it may be challenging for them\, and vice versa. It’s the magic of love.\n\nWe go through obstacles everyday\, do things that are difficult\, go to sleep\, wake up the next morning and we are willing to meet the day again – everyday. What we do is nothing short of magic. We run from one thing to another everyday without really pausing and looking. If we did we’d realize that the world we live in is full of magic. Project Magic is an attempt to stop and rediscover the magic surrounding us and in us.\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n&nbsp\;
