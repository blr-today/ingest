DESCRIPTION:Click here for the schedule.\nRegistrations for this event are now closed.\nIf we imagine inclusion in the arts and cultural sector as a landscape we have been mapping intuitively—sometimes through deliberation and by asking important questions such as: Did we do our best to make access equal for all? Did we push through collaboratively? Did we slow down to listen and evolve? And when did we realise that the map itself needed to be redrawn?\n\nThe Inclusion Conference has always been MAP’s attempt to ask these questions openly. What began in 2023 as a gathering to think about accessibility in cultural organisations\, has grown into an annual space where practitioners\, educators\, activists\, artists\, and community leaders convene to reflect on inclusive practices that shape the art &amp\; cultural spaces. Not merely as a value\, but also a practice informed by the unique perspectives of historically marginalised and underrepresented communities.\n\nYear after year\, MAP’s Inclusion conference has examined these questions from different vantage points: First\, through the lens of funding\, then through the systems and structures that enable or restrict those opportunities. In this third edition\, we turn our attention to measurement not as a checkbox\, but as a way of understanding whether our intentions translate into meaningful change.\n\nTo explore this\, the conference brings together voices who work at the intersections of justice\, care\, community organising\, and cultural practice:\n- Through fireside conversations\, we unpack how identities shape our understanding of culture and belonging.\n- Workshops guide participants through nuances of recognising unconscious bias\, navigating conflict\, and cinema poster politics of caste and gender.\n- Case study labs offer a closer look at community-led art &amp\; cultural collectives\, accessible practice\, multilingual engagement\, and grassroots education\, urging us to reflect on what works\, and what must evolve.\n\nThrough the day\, participants are encouraged to question their assumptions and biases\, as well as rethink and reimagine their roles. The conference culminates with a performance rooted in lived histories at the margins\, through a Song of Ghetto by Jangama Collective.\n\nMAP’s aim is to continuously evolve\, learn and bring forth innovative\, inclusive practices. This conference is a gathering of those who believe that cultural spaces can be more inclusive\, more imaginative\, and more equitable and those who are willing to walk the talk of shaping that future together.\n\nThis year’s MAP’s 3rd Inclusion conference\, Beyond Headcount Diversity at MAP is supported by:\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nMAP’s Accessibility Partner \n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nInclusion Conference 2023\n\nInclusion Conference 2024

DESCRIPTION:Image Courtesy: SAF\, Goa \nJoin us for a Visual Vernacular (VV) performance by Deaf performer Benin\, followed by an ISL poetry session by Hardeep Singh from the MAP team.\n\nVisual Vernacular (VV) is a dynamic form of visual storytelling used in deaf culture. It involves expressive body movements and facial expressions to convey complex narratives and emotions\, emphasising dramatic and artistic elements. Unlike traditional sign language\, which focuses on factual communication\, VV creates vivid\, engaging\, and multi-dimensional stories. \n\nISL Poetry is a visual form of expression that uses handshapes\, movement\, facial expressions\, and space instead of spoken words. Meaning is created through rhythm\, repetition\, and emotion in the body. Rather than being translated from spoken language\, ISL poetry is composed in the language itself\, celebrating Deaf culture and the expressive power of Indian Sign Language.\n\nThis performance is held in conjunction with our exhibition\, mild tooth of milk\, currently on display at the Dutch Warehouse in Fort Kochi.\n\nThis series of programs is hosted in collaboration with the Kerala Museum.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a theatre performance by Jangama Collective as part of our Inclusion Conference.\n\nArt looks at life through a framework. As it happens a lot of our lives fall outside of it\, as does ‘Song of the Ghetto’ which is an unscripted\, de-structured piece. The form and practice of theatre blossoms organically\, responds to the times it is created in and takes its own unique form. Similarly this performance is a curation of vignettes that defies formal structure and brings to the fore a harmony of the culture that the performers embody. It is a retelling of their lives through song and storytelling\; celebrating their lifestyles including the adversities they face.\n\nThis piece was created by the initiative of the Savithribai Phule Women’s Co-operative Group\, Dingdur in collaboration with Jangama Collective\, Bangalore and Guild of the Goat\, New Delhi.\n\nಕಲೆಯು ಜೀವನವನ್ನು ಒಂದು ಚೌಕಟ್ಟಿನಿಂದ ನೋಡುತ್ತದೆ. ನಮ್ಮ ಜೀವನದ ಬಹುಪಾಲು 'ಕೇರಿ ಹಾಡು' ನಾಟಕದಂತೆ ಈ ಚೌಕಟ್ಟಿನ ಹೊರಗಿದೆ - ಇದೊಂದು ಸಾಮೂಹಿಕ ಪ್ರಜಾಪ್ರಭುತ್ವ ಪ್ರಕ್ರಿಯೆಯ ಮೂಲಕ ರೂಪುಗೊಂಡ ನಾಟಕ. ಇದರಲ್ಲಿ ರಂಗದ ಮೇಲೆ ಅಭಿನಯಿಸುವ ಕಲಾವಿದರ ನೈಜ ಜೀವನ ಅನುಭವಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ಕಥೆಗಳೇ ಅಡಕವಾಗಿವೆ. ರಂಗಭೂಮಿಯ ರೂಪ ಮತ್ತು ಅಭ್ಯಾಸ ನೈಸರ್ಗಿಕವಾಗಿ ಬೆಳೆಯುತ್ತದೆ\, ತನ್ನ ಕಾಲಘಟ್ಟಕ್ಕೆ ಅನುಗುಣವಾಗಿ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ರಿಯಿಸುತ್ತದೆ ಮತ್ತು ವಿಶಿಷ್ಟ ರೂಪ ಪಡೆಯುತ್ತದೆ. ಹಾಗೆಯೇ\, ಈ ಪ್ರದರ್ಶನವೂ ಸಾಂಪ್ರದಾಯಿಕ ರಚನೆಯನ್ನು ಮೀರಿದ ಚಿತ್ರಣಗಳ ಸಂಕಲನವಾಗಿದ್ದು\, ಕಲಾವಿದರ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ಸಮಗ್ರತೆಯನ್ನು ಮುನ್ನೆಲೆಗೆ ತರುತ್ತದೆ. ಇದು ಅವರ ಬದುಕನ್ನು ಹಾಡು ಮತ್ತು ಕಥನಗಳ ಮೂಲಕ ಮರುಹೇಳುತ್ತಾ\, ಅವರು ಎದುರಿಸುವ ಸವಾಲುಗಳೂ ಸೇರಿದಂತೆ ಅವರ ಜೀವನಶೈಲಿಯನ್ನು ಆಚರಿಸುತ್ತದೆ.\n\nಈ ಕಲಾಕೃತಿಯು ಸಾವಿತ್ರಿಬಾಯಿ ಫುಲೆ ಮಹಿಳಾ ಸಹಕಾರ ಸಂಘ\, ದಿಂಡಗೂರು ಇವರ ಚಾಲನೆಯಲ್ಲಿ\, ಜಂಗಮ ಕಲೆಕ್ಟಿವ್\, ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು ಮತ್ತು ಗಿಲ್ಡ್ ಆಫ್ ದಿ ಗೋಟ್\, ನವದೆಹಲಿ ಇವರ ಸಹಯೋಗದಿಂದ ರೂಪುಗೊಂಡಿದೆ.\nಹಿನ್ನೆಲೆ: ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನಿಂದ ಸುಮಾರು ೧೪೦ ಕಿಲೋಮೀಟರ್ ದೂರದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ದಿಂಡಗೂರು ಗ್ರಾಮವಿದೆ. ದೇಶದ ಇತರ ಹಲವು ಗ್ರಾಮಗಳಂತೆಯೇ\, ಇಲ್ಲಿಯೂ ಊರ ಮಿತಿಯೊಳಗೆ ಒಂದು ಗಡಿ ಇದೆ - ಅದರಾಚೆಗೆ ದಲಿತರ ಕೇರಿ ಪ್ರಾರಂಭವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಇತ್ತೀಚಿನವರೆಗೂ\, "ಅಸ್ಪೃಶ್ಯ"ರೆಂದು ಪರಿಗಣಿಸಲ್ಪಟ್ಟ ಕಾರಣ ಕೇರಿಯ ಕುಟುಂಬಗಳಿಗೆ ಊರಿನ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಅಥವಾ ಹೋಟೆಲುಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರವೇಶವಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ.\n\n೨೦೨೧ರಲ್ಲಿ\, ಈ ಕುಟುಂಬಗಳು ಆಡಳಿತ ಯಂತ್ರಕ್ಕೆ ಮನವಿ ಸಲ್ಲಿಸಿ\, ಸಾರ್ವಜನಿಕ ಸ್ಥಳಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ದೇವಾಲಯಗಳ ಮೇಲಿನ ತಮ್ಮ ಹಕ್ಕನ್ನು ಸ್ಥಾಪಿಸಲು ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನಗಳನ್ನು ಪ್ರವೇಶಿಸಿದರು. ಈ ಧೈರ್ಯದ ಕೃತ್ಯದಿಂದಾಗಿ ಅವರು ಕೆಲಸ ಕಳೆದುಕೊಂಡರು\, ಏಕೆಂದರೆ ಬಹುತೇಕ ಉದ್ಯೋಗದಾತರು ಮೇಲ್ಜಾತಿಗೆ ಸೇರಿದವರಾಗಿದ್ದರು. ಆದರೆ ಈಗ ಈ ಕುಟುಂಬಗಳು ಸಾವಿತ್ರಿಬಾಯಿ ಫುಲೆ ಮಹಿಳಾ ಸಹಕಾರ ಸಂಘದ ಬೆಂಬಲ ಮತ್ತು ತರಬೇತಿಯಿಂದ ಅಣಬೆ ಕೃಷಿಯ ಮೂಲಕ ಸ್ವಾವಲಂಬಿಗಳಾಗಿದ್ದಾರೆ.

DESCRIPTION:Bharatanatyam is often called the dance of the cosmic god Nataraja in common parlance\, but a deeper look into history of the making of Bharatanatyam shows this narrative was engineered to erase the courtly origins of the dance form.\n\nNrithya Pillai's dance is about centering these erased hereditary histories—something she is a part of on account of her identity as being from these families whose performance was criminalised. The most common feature of “hereditary dance” is that the songs are themed around love\, and if there is one mythological figure who occupied a significant place in Bharatanatyam repertoire it was the God of Desire—Manmatha\, Maaran\, Kama\, Madhana.\n\nThis performance will showcase pieces from the hereditary repertoire that bring focus onto the themes of love\, and the poetic beauty of the imagery of how Manmatha is portrayed in these love songs.

They wove desire\, memory\, and meaning into the act of purchase. Join us for a guided walk of  our exhibition\, Ticket Tika Chaap\, to explore these textile labels\, their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in India.\n\n&nbsp\;
