DESCRIPTION:Join us for an evening that blends music\, art\, and craft with The Sarjapur Blues Band (SBB)\, featuring underground musicians Shekhar Seshadri (vocals and acoustic guitar) and Vinoo Matthew (electric guitar).\n\nThe self-professed “workingman’s\, back-street” duo will introduce us to lutherie - the art and craft of making wooden stringed instruments by hand. Discover the stories behind the SBB's unique\, handcrafted instruments as they perform their signature eclectic\, and original rhythm and blues.\n\nExpanding that conversation from the aural to the visual\, we also invite you to explore our ongoing exhibition\, Painting with Fire\, where we look at how wood becomes a canvas upon which two artists leave their mark. \n\nThis engagement is conceptualised under our exhibition Painting with Fire: Jeram Patel &amp\; Tarik Currimbhoy
