DESCRIPTION:Harper Collins India\nBig cats—tigers\, leopards\, and lions—that make prey of humans are commonly known as “man-eaters.”\nThis book reconceptualizes them as cats that have gone off the straight path to become “crooked.”\n\nJoin us for a talk by author Nayanika Mathur about her book ‘Crooked Cats: Beastly Encounters in the Anthropocene’. Building upon fifteen years of research in India\, this book moves beyond both colonial and conservationist accounts to place “crooked cats” at the centre of the question of how we are to comprehend a planet in crisis.\n\nThis programme is in conjunction with the exhibition The Many Lives of the Cat.

DESCRIPTION:Photo credits: Manu Rewal\nMAP presents two documentaries by filmmaker Manu Rewal that explore how architecture\, landscape\, and cultural histories come together in shaping two iconic Indian cities.\n\nMandu\, the City of Joy (1996) offers a portrait of the 15th-century hilltop capital where water systems\, terrain\, and architecture merge in inventive ways. Through miniature paintings and architectural reflections\, the film reveals Mandu’s distinctive synthesis of Hindu and Muslim artistic traditions.\n\nUdaipur\, a Romance with Nature (1997) traces how the city’s palaces\, lakes\, and urban form evolved in response to climate and geography. Set in the 16th and 17th centuries\, the film highlights Udaipur’s enduring dialogue between architecture and nature\, and its influence on later aesthetic visions.\n\nFollowing the screening\, join us for a Q&amp\;A with writer and director Manu Rewal\, offering deeper insights into his research\, process\, and the making of these films.
