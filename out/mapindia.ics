DESCRIPTION:Beyond ink and words\, paper itself becomes art in Ravikumar Kashi's We don't end at our edges. \n\nRavikumar Kashi is a Bengaluru-based artist\, writer and educator whose practice revolves around exploring the mechanics of meaning-making. We don’t end at our edges is an immersive exhibition featuring his artworks. He uses paper to ‘paint’ letters from the Kannada alphabet\, transforming language itself into a metaphor for the permeability of human connection\, suggesting that while physical forms may fade\, the bonds we share as individuals and as a community remain.\n\nJoin us for a conversation between MAP’s Collections Manager Rucha Vibhute and Ravikumar Kashi as they explore various aspects of his work\, inspiration behind his art and more.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an artist talk by Labani Jangi\, the recipient of the T.M. Krishna-PARI prize that honours individuals who bridge the worlds of art and journalism. Labani is a research scholar and cultural practitioner from Nadia in West Bengal who explores a layered tapestry of inquiry through her practice–observing the currents of resistance and identity formation beyond protected ignorance as they unfold in the world around her. \n\nDrawing from her daily realities as a Muslim woman in India\, Labani’s works are deeply rooted in lived experiences\, reflecting the fractures and solidarities of a world where subaltern voices are systematically invisibilised or romanticised. Her practice draws inspiration from forms like the Jari Gaan–a centuries-old song tradition from the Bengal region based on the legends of Karbala. The thematic concerns of her work strive to fight cultural homogenisation and erase threats to pluralism by focusing on sites that expose us to historical and ongoing oppressions in relation to each other–acting as a vital bridge that exposes a lineage of survival and expression for minority communities in the region.\n\nIn this session\, the artist will explore three series of works inspired by different sources: a poem by Palestinian poet Tawfiq Ziad\, the poem Chambal Ek Nadi by poet and filmmaker Naresh Saxena\, and the legend of Hijrat. Labani will be in conversation with Soumydeep Dasgupta from MAP’s Education team.\n\nThis talk will mostly be in Hindi with occasional switches to Bangla which will be translated by the interlocutor.\n\nThis event is part of VISIBLE/INVISIBLE:Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection exhibition programming.

DESCRIPTION:In this workshop\, Mara Oscar Cassiani invites participants to engage in a collective experience that merges digital and physical realms\, exploring how algorithms typically used to shape online content and interactions can be repurposed as prompts for rituals to create moments of shared reflection and connection.\n\nAt the heart of the workshop is a series of gifs and memes created by the artist herself\, and presented as tarot cards inspired by ritual female archetypes—universal symbols that evoke shared narratives and collective identities. These digital elements act as catalysts for group rituals that move fluidly between augmented reality and real-life interactions. \n\nThe workshop draws on Mara Oscar Cassiani’s research into 'expanded rituals'—rituals that emerge from the algorithmic bubbles shaping our online experiences. These bubbles generate personalised digital environments through suggested content. The artist explores how traditional rituals\, often linked to specific cultural and social practices\, are being reshaped and influenced by these algorithmic currents on the internet.\n\nThis workshop offers a participatory experience where digital art and ritual converge\, revealing how technology shapes our shared human stories. Participants will explore how algorithmic influences extend beyond the screen\, evolving into tangible and communal practices.\n\nNotes for the participants: The workshop involves light physical activity. Please wear comfortable sneakers and sportswear\, and bring a mat to sit on if desired.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an evening of art\, vision\, and conversation as designer Janak Mistry sits down with Rustam Vania to discuss DEEP SEE — a captivating visual journey through India’s vibrant diversity.\n\nWhat began as casual snapshots on the streets over a decade ago with Janak Mistry’s first smartphone has evolved into a book reflecting various perspectives.\n\nIn DEEP SEE\, Janak Mistry captures ordinary sights to encourage people to discover the extraordinary in the everyday. All images in this book were taken with a mobile phone\, focusing not on perfection but on seizing fleeting moments. The book showcases a unique vision that transforms the mundane into the remarkable\, with playful\, nonlinear texts revealing multiple layers of reality in each image.\n\nBe part of a thought-provoking conversation on art\, vision\, and the power of mobile photography.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a compelling screening and discussion that delves into the utopian ideals shaping post-independence India. \n\nNostalgia for the Future (2017) by Avijit Mukul Kishore and Rohan Shivkumar is a film essay exploring Indian modernity\, citizenship\, and the architecture of homes over a century. Weaving together 16mm and digital footage\, archival propaganda films\, and mainstream cinema\, the film examines four iconic spaces—the royal palace in Baroda\, Le Corbusier’s Villa Shodhan\, Sabarmati Ashram\, and Delhi’s public housing—reflecting on the aspirations and contradictions of a nation.\n\nAcclaimed at Documenta 14\, Sharjah Architecture Triennial\, and the Chicago Architecture Biennial\, the film won Best Documentary (IDSFFK\, 2017) and Best Experimental Documentary (Signs Festival\, 2018).\n\nFollowing the screening\, the filmmakers will be in conversation with Ashish Rajadhyaksha\, discussing the intersections of cinema\, memory\, and built environments.\n\nThis film is part of the Eckart Muthesius and Manik Bagh exhibition programming.

DESCRIPTION:Are your devices listening to you? This question\, while often dismissed as an urban myth\, has deeply influenced how we perceive and interact with algorithmic systems. The artist uses this ambiguity as a starting point for a collective experiment in which participants are encouraged to disrupt their phones’ usual flow of suggested content\, rewriting their algorithmic realities to explore new narratives and potential futures.\n\nIn this workshop\, artist and social designer Ginevra Petrozzi invites participants to explore the intersection of magical thinking and surveillance technologies. She draws inspiration from Italy’s folkloric traditions and heritage\, reviving knowledge that was preserved in secret and passed down clandestinely through generations of women. \n\nCentral to the workshop is the collaborative creation of a "Perfect Futures" script—an exercise in crafting counter-narratives that stand in contrast to the prepackaged stories curated by our devices. Participants will work with Petrozzi to transform these scripts into a form of digital enchantment\, playfully subverting the predictive logic of algorithms through whispered incantations. The workshop will culminate in a collective performance\, where the "Perfect Futures" are recited as a “spell” into participants’ devices\, mirroring a popular TikTok trend that involves whispering keywords and phrases into an unguarded phone to influence its algorithm.\n\nIn this participatory experience\, the artist encourages participants to rethink their relationship with technology\, experimenting with the idea that language and intention might hold the power to enchant not only the digital sphere but also our collective futures.\n\nRegistrations for this event are closed.
