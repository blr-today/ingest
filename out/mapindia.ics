DESCRIPTION:Fear\, intimidation\, objectification and victims are the predominant themes in images used to depict sexual violence against women in the media. Can you visualise images that are more empowering\, more nuanced\, that show women in all their complexity\, that show resilience and resistance? Be a part of challenging and changing this visual discourse\n\nCome\, share your talent\, share your vision in this workshop facilitated by the Hri Institute for Southasian Research in conjunction to their project Challenging Visual Depiction of Women and Sexual Violence in Southasia which aims to challenge gender insensitive visual and aural depiction of sexual violence against women in Southasia. \n\nThanks to robust women’s movements in the region\, the rising incidents and brutality of incidents of sexual violence has been met with strong protests and demands for accountability. Considerable strides forward have been made to improve media reporting of sexual violence\, making it less sensational\, more based on women’s lived experiences\, gender-sensitive and ethical. However\, images that accompany news-reports tend to remain stereotypical and even damaging by reinforcing stigma\, helplessness\, shame and victim-blaming. Join this workshop and learn to create a more empowering and compassionate visual narrative.\n\nSelected works (sketches\, paintings\, cartoons\, photos) will be showcased on the website of the Hri Institute as part of the pool of stock images that exists.

DESCRIPTION:A report by The Media Rumble and UN Women in early 2019 analysed India’s leading newspapers\, magazines\, TV channels\, and news websites. It found that in a six-month period in 2018\, only 8% of content—news reports\, features\, opinion pieces\, and primetime debates—focused on gender issues.\n\nThis is alarmingly low. A sustained focus on understanding the issues\, interests and concerns of women and gender minorities is crucial to undoing the patriarchal systems that bind us.  Non-sexist representation that moves beyond outrage cycles and victim shaming is key to reshaping narratives. This requires both a shift in content and the structure of journalistic institutions to address gender issues beyond sensationalism. Sensitive storytelling should centre the voices of women and gender minorities\, critically explore widening gender disparities\, and adopt new\, compassionate ways to present these stories.\n\nJoin us for a panel discussion featuring Priti David from PARI (People’s Archive of Rural India)\, Laxmi Murthy from Hri Southasian\, Priyanka Tupe from Behan Box\, and Shabani Hassanwalia from The Third Eye. Each of these institutions\, in their distinct ways\, have employed a people-first approach in storytelling\; allowing to build sensitivity and instances for continued learning around gender.\n\nThis panel discussion is conceptualised under our exhibition VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection.
