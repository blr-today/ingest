DESCRIPTION:This workshop facilitated by Bhumika Saraswati\, invites participants to creatively document the subtle but urgent impacts of extreme heat\, especially its invisible effects indoors and outdoors. Through visuals and text\, we will explore how heat intersects with gender\, caste\, and identity in our everyday life. We will also reflect on the gendered nature of certain crises and how they exacerbate existing inequalities.\n\nIn Phase 1\, we’ll explore the challenge of visually capturing heat\, a crisis that lacks visible markers yet shapes lives deeply. Using examples from her work\, Bhumika will discuss how to approach sensitive storytelling\, whether capturing one’s own experiences or those of others. \n\nIn Phase 2\, we’ll move to hands-on creative engagement. Participants will be prompted to represent their personal experiences of heat—whether through photography\, drawing\, video\, or writing. This phase emphasises honest expression and encourages careful\, thoughtful observation.\n\nFinally\, in Phase 3\, we’ll share and reflect on the pieces created. This is an open space for participants to present their work and discuss the diverse ways we perceive and document heat. The workshop will conclude with a discussion on making invisible climate impacts visible\, particularly within the contexts of gender and social identity.\n\nLimited spots available.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a special screening of the critically acclaimed Malayalam film\, Uttarayanam. Directed by the legendary filmmaker Aravindan\, the film follows the journey of Ravi\, a young\, unemployed man who encounters a series of challenges in his quest for employment. As Ravi reflects on the sacrifices of India's freedom fighters\, he becomes disillusioned by the corrupt practices of those who once championed the cause of independence. The screening will be followed by a discussion facilitated by Ashish Rajyadhyaksha and C S Venkiteshwaran.\n\nThis film screening is the third in our six-month long series\, ‘The Radical Seventies’\, a collaboration between MAP and Bangalore Film Forum\, co-curated by Ashish Rajadhyaksha. \n\nThis series has been conceptualised as part of MAP’s youth engagement programming.\n\nThe Radical Seventies is a series that is specially crafted for youth to engage with older classics that resonate with our contemporary times\, in familiar and unexpected ways. Through the 1970s\, Indian cinema saw several major experiments in cinema — often made in direct conversation with radical politics. The decade began in the late 1960s and spilled over into the early 1980s. Uttarayanam offers a fresh perspective on love\, loss\, and the human condition\, reflecting the innovative spirit of 1970s Indian cinema.
