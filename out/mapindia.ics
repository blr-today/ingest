DESCRIPTION:From dancing elephants and beloved deities to the surprising sight of steamships\, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery.\n\nTextile labels arrived in Indian markets in their thousands\, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India)\, and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire\, memory\, and meaning into the act of purchase. \n\nOur latest exhibition\, Ticket Tika Chaap\, explores these textile labels\, known as tikats (tickets)\, tikas or chaaps\, and their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in India.\n\nJoin us for a guided walk of this exhibition.

What do our personal playlists say about us\, and how might they be remembered years from now?\n\nJoin us at our next Community Check-In\, where we dive into vintage song booklets from MAP’s collection—once sold in cinema halls during intermissions\, now turned into cherished souvenirs and artefacts. Produced in both portrait and landscape formats\, these ephemeral materials featured striking film posters\, cast and crew details\, plot summaries\, and lyrics from the soundtrack—offering a fascinating glimpse into how music and cinema were consumed and remembered.\n\nLet’s get inspired from these retro artefacts\, reflect on our own relationships with music and work together to create our own song booklets that capture the soundtrack of our young lives today!\n\nThis event is organised in conjunction with Pulse\, MAP’s online youth journal\, and offers a sneak peek into the theme of the upcoming Volume V: Soundtrack of Our Lives. \n\nCrafted as part of MAP’s youth engagement initiatives\, Pulse serves as a platform for young voices\; a collaborative and independent space run by young adults for young adults to share their creative work and practice.\n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.

DESCRIPTION: Image credits: Jugaad Co. \n\nWe go through life oblivious to the wondrous things we do and the magical beings we are. The fact is there’s magic all around us and there’s magic in us. People who love\, do things for us\, even if it makes them uncomfortable - even though it may be challenging for them\, and vice versa. It’s the magic of love.\n\nWe go through obstacles everyday\, do things that are difficult\, go to sleep\, wake up the next morning and we are willing to meet the day again – everyday. What we do is nothing short of magic. We run from one thing to another everyday without really pausing and looking. If we did we’d realize that the world we live in is full of magic. Project Magic is an attempt to stop and rediscover the magic surrounding us and in us.\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n&nbsp\;
