DTSTAMP:20250715T111511Z
DESCRIPTION:This panel explores the ways in which Dalit identities are represented and appropriated across literature\, cinema\, and visual art. The discussion features Mahisha from the Neelavarna Collective\, visual artist Rahee Punyashloka\, and activist-writer Du Saraswathi\, and is moderated by Vijetha.\n\nThe conversation will reflect on questions of authorship\, agency\, and voice — who tells these stories\, how they are told\, and for whom. As Dalit narratives gain increased visibility in the public domain\, this session invites a critical dialogue on the ethics of representation and the importance of centring lived experiences in artistic expression.\n\nSupported by Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan\n\nImage Credits: Rahee Punyashloka

DESCRIPTION:India is a land of Subaltern deities\, where each deity has a unique legend and these legends are often interwoven with socio-historic tropes of India.\n\nThe Puthirai vannaar  are a Dalit caste group known as the 'unseeable'\, in southern India. Their forced-occupation is to wash the clothes of other Dalits\, the dead\, and menstruating women. This film explores the tale of a young girl who grew up in the Puthirai vannaar caste group and how she came to be immortalised as their local deity\, Maadathy.\n\nThe screening will be followed by a conversation with the director of the film\, Leena Manimekalai.\n\nSupported by Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan.\n\nDo note: This is a Tamil language film and is subtitled in English.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a special Indian Sign Language interpreted walkthrough of Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar. The exhibition invites visitors to pause and reflect\, observe and be inspired. Come on a journey of introspection through the mesmerising artworks and evocative letters of Ram Kumar\, one of India’s most renowned modernists on the occasion of his centenary year.\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by two activities that create a deeper engagement with the art on display. The Writing Table gives audiences a chance to write a letter to themselves\, loved ones\, strangers\, or even a city through a set of prompts. Family Label facilitates an exploration of abstract art by allowing visitors to look at artworks and creating a label on what they think the artwork means\, or what they see or feel when faced with an abstract artwork.\n\nShape of a Thought also features the film ‘The Spaces in Between’ by Naveed Mulki. The film explores letter exchanges between Ram Kumar and his friend and the many conversations they have on life\, art and the world.

DESCRIPTION:Come Eat With Me is a performance piece that explores the relationship between caste and food while sharing a meal together. Focusing on Dalit Cuisine\, the piece begins with personal stories and oral histories around food in the performer's household and community and is peppered with existing literature and academic writing around the multilayered\, many-flavoured relationships between caste and food. The piece unpacks questions of oppression and solidarity\, grief and joy\, and the everyday victories of the human spirit in the face of structural injustices.\n\nAudiences are invited to eat together and share their own stories around caste and food. In doing so the form subverts an activity laden with caste hierarchies and hopes to create a space for community building\, and now it has sort of evolved into an event that will/has to find its place in the larger anti-caste movement\, in the Ambedkarite movement.\n\nSupported by Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan\n\nImage credits: Vamsi

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: East Indians on a Trinidad cocoa estate\, Published in The Food of the Gods: A Popular Account of Cocoa (1903)\n\nChutney Soca is a genre born from the unlikely meeting of Bhojpuri folk traditions and the pulse of Caribbean Calypso and Soca. Rooted in the journey of Indian indentured labourers to Trinidad and Guyana\, this session hosted by Focus Group Radio traces the cultural collision and creative fusion that gave rise to Chutney Soca—through music\, documentary snippets\, and stories. \n\nFrom Bhojpuri folk traditions to Carnival stages\, in this session we’ll explore how two distinct worlds came together to create something entirely new\, loud\, and full of life.\n\n&nbsp\;
