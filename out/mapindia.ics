DESCRIPTION:How do we truly engage with art? Is it simply appreciating its aesthetic beauty\, or is there more to it?\n\nThis month's Tuesday Tidbits features Shubhasree Purkayastha from our Education and Outreach team and focuses on looking beyond the surface to foster learning experiences and make meaningful connections with art. She will focus on our latest exhibition\, Chay Reds\, Ferrous Black\, which includes a story trail especially designed for families to use as a fun journey through the show. Discussing the behind-the-scenes process of developing this\, she will highlight how the education team uses exhibitions as the foundation to drive greater creative engagement.     \n\nTuesday Tidbits is a series that seeks to support youth in career research/building and acts as a space for networking for young people.
