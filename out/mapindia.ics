DESCRIPTION:Join us for a special walkthrough of Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar in Kannada. The exhibition invites visitors to pause and reflect\, observe and be inspired. Come on a journey of introspection through the mesmerising artworks and evocative letters of Ram Kumar\, one of India’s most renowned modernists on the occasion of his centenary year.\nThe exhibition is accompanied by two activities that create a deeper engagement with the art on display. The Writing Table gives audiences a chance to write a letter to themselves\, loved ones\, strangers\, or even a city through a set of prompts. Family Label facilitates an exploration of abstract art by allowing visitors to look at artworks and creating a label on what they think the artwork means\, or what they see or feel when faced with an abstract artwork.\nShape of a Thought also features the film ‘The Spaces in Between’ by Naveed Mulki. The film explores letter exchanges between Ram Kumar and his friend and the many conversations they have on life\, art and the world.

DESCRIPTION:Zines have long been spaces for reflection\, resistance and reclaiming stories. In this workshop with writer-illustrator Preston Olakatu\, explore zine-making as a creative act of self-expression — one that holds space for personal narratives\, queerness and community.\n\nThe workshop will begin with a short presentation covering the history and cultural significance of zines\, tracing their roots from punk and feminist movements to present-day DIY publishing. \n\nWith an emphasis on experimentation\, create your own zine exploring different formats while learning techniques such as layering\, sequencing and layout structure.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a theatrical reading of Ram Kumar’s Husna Bibi. This short story traces the poignant journey of a once-revered ghazal singer\, now struggling with the decline of her art and identity. Once the darling of mehfils and musical salons\, Husna Bibi finds herself slowly erased from public memory as the seductive appeal of Bollywood music sweeps across the subcontinent\, altering taste and tradition.  \n\nRam Kumar masterfully captures the sorrow of cultural displacement\, the erosion of refined artistic values\, and the inner strength of a woman who stands tall amidst irrelevance. Through sparse prose and restrained sentimentality\, he offers a quiet but sharp critique of modernity’s blind rush and the loss of authenticity in the face of mass appeal. \n\nThis event is in Hindi.\n\nThis event is in conjunction with MAP’s latest exhibition Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.
