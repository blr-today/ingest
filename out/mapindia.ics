DESCRIPTION:We are back! In this session we delve into the multifaceted nature of food and its influence in shaping one’s identity. We will be reading Vinay Kumar’s Blood Fry &amp\; Other Dalit Recipes from my Childhood which foregrounds the idea that along with a stark remembrance of taste\, food carries with it memories of the past and an intersection with the present: What is their role in cultivating identity? Whose cultures and traditions are remembered and whose forgotten? Alongside this text\, we explore Daisy Johnson's article Ritual\, reflecting on the act of preparing\, cooking and serving a dish\, a process laden with emotion and rooted in familial and cultural heritage.\n\nOn registration\, we will send you the text and the topics/themes we will discuss.\n\nReader’s Bloc is an online/IRL group of readers taking part in reading\, listening and sharing exercises around texts that help us learn more about ourselves\, the identities we share and the communities we live in.\n\nThis programme is exclusively for 18–25-year-olds. \n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year-olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.
