DESCRIPTION:Join us for a special Indian Sign Language interpreted walkthrough of Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar. The exhibition invites visitors to pause and reflect\, observe and be inspired. Come on a journey of introspection through the mesmerising artworks and evocative letters of Ram Kumar\, one of India’s most renowned modernists on the occasion of his centenary year.\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by two activities that create a deeper engagement with the art on display. The Writing Table gives audiences a chance to write a letter to themselves\, loved ones\, strangers\, or even a city through a set of prompts. Family Label facilitates an exploration of abstract art by allowing visitors to look at artworks and creating a label on what they think the artwork means\, or what they see or feel when faced with an abstract artwork.\n\nShape of a Thought also features the film ‘The Spaces in Between’ by Naveed Mulki. The film explores letter exchanges between Ram Kumar and his friend and the many conversations they have on life\, art and the world.

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Queer Archive for Memory\, Reflection\, and Activism (QAMRA)\, Bengaluru\n\nThis workshop brings together two powerful tools of counter-narrative—art and the queer archive—to explore how we can use them in tandem to tell stories of our own. Together\, as participants and facilitators\, we will experiment with ways of broadening our relationship with history\, critically examining the present\, and imagining the futures we hope for and work towards.\n\nThrough a series of hands-on exercises and discussions\, we will explore three key themes:\n\nPreservation\n- What do we choose to preserve\, and how? We will engage with a range of materials to think about preservation both practically and politically.\n\nOrganisation\n- How does the structure of memory storage shape how it is understood? We’ll reflect on different archival logics and the possibilities of queering archival organisation\n\nAccess\n- How do we dream through the archive? We’ll imagine the audiences of the future and consider how we want our saved materials to speak to them.\n\nThis workshop is an invitation to think\, feel\, and make within the space of collective memory and queer futurity.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:From dancing elephants and beloved deities\, to steamships and radiators\, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery. These labels arrived in Indian markets in the thousands\, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India)\, and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire\, memory\, and meaning into the act of purchase.\n\nThe exhibition\, Ticket Tika Chaap\, explores these textile labels known as tikats (tickets)\, tikas or chaaps\, and their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in India.\n\nPlease note: This guided walk\, will be conducted in Kannada by Rajesh from the MAP Team.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Most of us have spent our childhood playing with dolls. This time\, let us go back in time with a vibrant lac-turning workshop led by rural woodcraft artisans. Discover the story behind this age-old craft\, try your hand at shaping wood on a lathe\, and bring your very own wooden doll to life with colours\, quirks\, and creativity. It’s hands-on heritage — playful\, personal\, and proudly made by you. Because we believe\, tradition isn’t just passed down — it’s passed around\, and the living heritage of crafts can find its way to your home.\n\nIn the workshop\, you will learn about the natural materials used\, such as organic lac and renewable ivory wood\, and how they're combined to create these beautiful dolls. Get a sneak peek into the traditional hand-turning method.\n\nDo note: Materials will be provided.\n\nThis workshop is in conjunction with the showcase Putul Katha: Dolls and Stories from West Bengal.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Vivek Shetty\n\nLed by Steevez\, the workshop blends music\, memory\, and identity into a 16-page book. Using MAP’s digital collections as raw material\, along with your own digital content\, you can design and bind your own “mixtape”—on paper.\n\nThe workshop draws from Steevez’s own practice\, especially his photobook Last Seen\, which reimagines the form of a photograph through digital remnants—emails\, Facebook chats\, and Orkut messages exchanged with his late father. The book becomes both a personal archive and a meditation on how we hold onto relationships in the digital age. Music\, among other inspirations\, plays a key role in shaping this narrative.\n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.\n\nThis event is in conjunction with Pulse: MAP’s online quarterly journal. Pulse\, as part of MAP’s Youth Engagement Initiatives\, serves as a digital collaborative platform for young voices wherein young\, creative minds share their work and practice. Entries are now open for Vol. V: Soundscapes.
