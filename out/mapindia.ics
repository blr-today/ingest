DESCRIPTION:Click here for the schedule.\n\nIf we imagine inclusion in the arts and cultural sector as a landscape we have been mapping intuitively—sometimes through deliberation and by asking important questions such as: Did we do our best to make access equal for all? Did we push through collaboratively? Did we slow down to listen and evolve? And when did we realise that the map itself needed to be redrawn?\n\nThe Inclusion Conference has always been MAP’s attempt to ask these questions openly. What began in 2023 as a gathering to think about accessibility in cultural organisations\, has grown into an annual space where practitioners\, educators\, activists\, artists\, and community leaders convene to reflect on inclusive practices that shape the art &amp\; cultural spaces. Not merely as a value\, but also a practice informed by the unique perspectives of historically marginalised and underrepresented communities.\n\nYear after year\, MAP’s Inclusion conference has examined these questions from different vantage points: First\, through the lens of funding\, then through the systems and structures that enable or restrict those opportunities. In this third edition\, we turn our attention to measurement not as a checkbox\, but as a way of understanding whether our intentions translate into meaningful change.\n\nTo explore this\, the conference brings together voices who work at the intersections of justice\, care\, community organising\, and cultural practice:\n- Through fireside conversations\, we unpack how identities shape our understanding of culture and belonging.\n- Workshops guide participants through nuances of recognising unconscious bias\, navigating conflict\, and cinema poster politics of caste and gender.\n- Case study labs offer a closer look at community-led art &amp\; cultural collectives\, accessible practice\, multilingual engagement\, and grassroots education\, urging us to reflect on what works\, and what must evolve.\n\nThrough the day\, participants are encouraged to question their assumptions and biases\, as well as rethink and reimagine their roles. The conference culminates with a performance rooted in lived histories at the margins\, through a Song of Ghetto by Jangama Collective.\n\nMAP’s aim is to continuously evolve\, learn and bring forth innovative\, inclusive practices. This conference is a gathering of those who believe that cultural spaces can be more inclusive\, more imaginative\, and more equitable and those who are willing to walk the talk of shaping that future together.\n\nThis year’s MAP’s 3rd Inclusion conference\, Beyond Headcount Diversity at MAP is supported by:\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nMAP’s Accessibility Partner \n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nInclusion Conference 2023\n\nInclusion Conference 2024

DESCRIPTION:Image credit: Tinctures\nThis workshop is aimed at opening up one’s musicality\, with an emphasis on having fun with composition and improvisation. Join us for a day-long workshop focused on musical games with the band Tinctures.\n\nThese carefully curated games will serve as a creative gateway to exploring the fundamental components of music – melody\, harmony and rhythm – in a playful and non linear way. The participants will then use the musical games to improvise and compose pieces for a public performance in duo format\, joining in the Tinctures concert at the end of the workshop. \n\nAlong the way\, we’ll also take a look at various examples from Tinctures’ concept-based compositions\, and see how consonance and dissonance can be artfully deployed.

DESCRIPTION:Beauty in the broken. One of Red House's most popular engagements\, the Kintsugi workshop\, celebrates the Japanese philosophy and technique of repairing broken pottery with lacquer and powdered gold. \n\nIn this workshop\, participants are given whole ceramics\, which they break with a hammer\, and then rejoin. In the process\, participants learn that kintsugi goes beyond mere repair\; and that it is a profound philosophy and art form that promotes the appreciation of imperfections\, resilience\, and the beauty of the broken.
