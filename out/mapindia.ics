DESCRIPTION:Explore MAP's latest exhibition\, The Forgotten Souvenir\, through a guided walk and discover how  the art of mica paintings\, created during the East India Company’s heyday. These paintings\, both art and historical documents\, showcase professions\, societal roles\, and colonial India's rigid caste and class systems and thus\, offer unique insights into everyday life under colonial rule.  \n\nThese delicate works\, painted on thin sheets of muscovite mica from Murshidabad\, Patna\, and Trichinopoly\, reflect the adaptation of Indian artists as royal patronage declined. They served as easily portable\, attractive souvenirs for British travellers\, bridging the gap between traditional miniature painting and the rise of photography.  \n\nAccompanied by Amit Dutta’s short film Moments before Mutiny and an interactive game\, this guided walk invites you to journey deeper into this nearly forgotten chapter of Indian art.\n\nPhoto Credits: Philippe Calia

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a screening of Alana Hunt’s film Surveilling a Crime Scene\, followed by the artist in conversation with filmmaker Yashaswini Raghunandan.\n\nShot on Super 8mm film\, Alana Hunt’s Surveilling a Crime Scene (2023) examines the materialisation of non-Indigenous life on Miriwoong Country—through the town of Kununurra and its surrounds\, in the remote north-west of current-day Australia. The film aligns and overlays what may otherwise seem like discontinuous domains—a dam\, tourism\, a historical monument\, agriculture\, a police station\, cigarette burns\, and bureaucratic forms—to produce a silhouette of tools\, techniques\, and procedures of power and oppression. Surveilling a Crime Scene delivers a gentle yet powerful tapestry of evidence that recognises colonisation not as history but as a continuous and present violence\, one that is deceptively ordinary.\n\nAlana’s work is driven by lived experiences and honed through a forensic approach to research. It is shaped by relationships and often materialises through video\, printed matter\, photography\, publishing\, public events and illicit interventions. Formed by over a decade of life on Gija and Miriwoong Countries in north-west Australia\, Alana’s work in Australia examines contemporary colonial culture\, scratching at things not commonly recognised as colonial or violent but deeply so—tourism and leisure\, development\, legislation\, and home.\n\nBeyond Australia\, Alana's work in South Asia includes the iterative memorial Cups of nun chai (2010-20) published by Yaarbal Books (2020) and Paper txt msgs from Kashmir (2009-11).\n\nFollowing the screening\, Alana will be in conversation with filmmaker Yashaswini Raghunandan about the making of the film and the contents of her practice at large.\n\n(Credit line: Still from Surveilling a Crime Scene\, Image Courtesy: Alana Hunt)
