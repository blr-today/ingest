DESCRIPTION:This weekend\, travel back to the seventies and enjoy Awtar Krishna Kaul’s 27 Down\, a 1974 drama based on the Hindi novel Athara Sooraj Ke Paudhe. The film is centred around Sanjay\, a railway employee who is battling between his duty towards his authoritarian father and his desire for freedom. 27 Down is popular for its unique cinematography\, themes of societal expectations\, pursuit of dreams and self-discovery.\n\nThis film screening is the second in our six-month long series\, ‘The Radical Seventies’\, a collaboration between MAP and Bangalore Film Forum\, co-curated by Ashish Rajadhyaksha. \n\nThis series has been conceptualised as part of MAP’s youth engagement programming.\n\nThe Radical Seventies is a series that is specially crafted for youth to engage with older classics that resonate with our contemporary times\, in familiar and unexpected ways. Through the 1970s\, Indian cinema saw several major experiments in cinema — often made in direct conversation with radical politics. The decade began in the late 1960s and spilled over into the early 1980s. With 27 Down\, we embark on another chapter of this journey\, exploring questions around evolving identities\, migration\, and the push and pull between independence\, empowering anonymity and the loneliness of the urban experience.
