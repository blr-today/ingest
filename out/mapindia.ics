DESCRIPTION:Zines have long been spaces for reflection\, resistance and reclaiming stories.

Following which participants will  explore a variety of zine formats and think about layout\, sequencing\, and folding techniques. Create your own zines with the help of creative prompts. The emphasis here is on experimentation rather than perfection!\n\nSign up to block your spot as seats are limited!

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a theatrical reading of Ram Kumar’s Husna Bibi. This short story traces the poignant journey of a once-revered ghazal singer\, now struggling with the decline of her art and identity. Once the darling of mehfils and musical salons\, Husna Bibi finds herself slowly erased from public memory as the seductive appeal of Bollywood music sweeps across the subcontinent\, altering taste and tradition.  \n\nRam Kumar masterfully captures the sorrow of cultural displacement\, the erosion of refined artistic values\, and the inner strength of a woman who stands tall amidst irrelevance. Through sparse prose and restrained sentimentality\, he offers a quiet but sharp critique of modernity’s blind rush and the loss of authenticity in the face of mass appeal. \n\nThis event is in Hindi.\n\nThis event is in conjunction with MAP’s latest exhibition Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.
