DESCRIPTION:What stories do laws tell—and what stories do they silence? In this walkthrough of MAP’s permanent exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection\, we follow six striking artworks and artefacts that offer unexpected entry points into the world of law\, justice\, and feminist resistance.\n\nFrom colonial rule to contemporary protest\, these pieces help us ask: Who gets to speak? Who gets seen? And what might it mean to read the law—not as a set of fixed rules\, but as an ongoing struggle over power\, voice\, and visibility?\n\nInspired by the idea that law is not just about order\, but about shaping what counts as common sense\, this guided walk led by lawyer Shrimoyee Nandini Ghosh\, invites you to see legal history differently—with curiosity\, care\, and imagination.\n\nImage: Citizens (Little Black Drawings series)\, Rajan M Krishnan\, 2003\, Compressed charcoal and serigraphy on handmade paper\, MAC.01768

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a guided walk of our new exhibition We don’t end at our edges. It is an immersive exhibition featuring artworks by Bengaluru-based artist\, writer and educator Ravikumar Kashi.

DESCRIPTION:Give your photographs a dramatic flair! Join us for a photography workshop facilitated by Sridhar Balasubramaniyam\, one of the artists featured in Vaanyerum Vizhuthugal. The workshop explores constructed portraits and how to view landscapes through a theatrical lens.\n\nSridhar brings in his experience as a theatre artist by using available props and lighting and will guide participants through the art of constructed portraits. The focus of this session is not to create aesthetic images but images with multilayered meanings and masked identities. \n\n&nbsp\;\n\nPlease note: \n\nCamera is required for this workshop. Basic photography skills are helpful but not essential.\n\nImage credits: Sridhar Balasubramaniyam

DESCRIPTION:From dancing elephants and beloved deities to the surprising sight of steamships\, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery.\n\nTextile labels arrived in Indian markets in their thousands\, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India)\, and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire\, memory\, and meaning into the act of purchase. \n\nJoin us for a guided walk of our latest exhibition\, Ticket Tika Chaap\, which explores these textile labels\, known as tikats (tickets)\, tikas or chaaps\, and their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in India.\n\nThis guided walk will also give you FREE access to the otherwise ticketed exhibition.
