DESCRIPTION:Curious about the role of a photographer in a museum? This month’s Tuesday Tidbits features Saikat Das from our collections team who will be focusing on the importance of digitisation and documentation in preserving our cultural heritage. In this session\, discover why these practices are essential and the challenges and delights of effectively digitising and documenting varied objects in a museum setting.\n\nIf you’re curious about how a museum digitises a 9 foot long textile\, captures the details of a miniature painting or if you’re someone exploring career options in the museum and cultural space\, then this session is perfect for you. \n\nTuesday Tidbits is a series that seeks to support youth in career research/building and acts as a space for networking for young people.

DESCRIPTION:A report by The Media Rumble and UN Women in early 2019 analysed India’s leading newspapers\, magazines\, TV channels\, and news websites. It found that in a six-month period in 2018\, only 8% of content—news reports\, features\, opinion pieces\, and primetime debates—focused on gender issues.\n\nThis is alarmingly low. A sustained focus on understanding the issues\, interests and concerns of women and gender minorities is crucial to undoing the patriarchal systems that bind us.  Non-sexist representation that moves beyond outrage cycles and victim shaming is key to reshaping narratives. This requires both a shift in content and the structure of journalistic institutions to address gender issues beyond sensationalism. Sensitive storytelling should centre the voices of women and gender minorities\, critically explore widening gender disparities\, and adopt new\, compassionate ways to present these stories.\n\nJoin us for a panel discussion featuring Priti David from PARI (People’s Archive of Rural India)\, Laxmi Murthy from Hri Southasian\, Priyanka Tupe from Behan Box\, and Shabani Hassanwalia from The Third Eye. Each of these institutions\, in their distinct ways\, have employed a people-first approach in storytelling\; allowing to build sensitivity and instances for continued learning around gender.\n\nThis panel discussion is conceptualised under our exhibition VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection.
