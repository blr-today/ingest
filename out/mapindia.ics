DESCRIPTION:Click here for the schedule.\n\nIf we imagine inclusion in the arts and cultural sector as a landscape we have been mapping intuitively—sometimes through deliberation and by asking important questions such as: Did we do our best to make access equal for all? Did we push through collaboratively? Did we slow down to listen and evolve? And when did we realise that the map itself needed to be redrawn?\n\nThe Inclusion Conference has always been MAP’s attempt to ask these questions openly. What began in 2023 as a gathering to think about accessibility in cultural organisations\, has grown into an annual space where practitioners\, educators\, activists\, artists\, and community leaders convene to reflect on inclusive practices that shape the art &amp\; cultural spaces. Not merely as a value\, but also a practice informed by the unique perspectives of historically marginalised and underrepresented communities.\n\nYear after year\, MAP’s Inclusion conference has examined these questions from different vantage points: First\, through the lens of funding\, then through the systems and structures that enable or restrict those opportunities. In this third edition\, we turn our attention to measurement not as a checkbox\, but as a way of understanding whether our intentions translate into meaningful change.\n\nTo explore this\, the conference brings together voices who work at the intersections of justice\, care\, community organising\, and cultural practice:\n- Through fireside conversations\, we unpack how identities shape our understanding of culture and belonging.\n- Workshops guide participants through nuances of recognising unconscious bias\, navigating conflict\, and cinema poster politics of caste and gender.\n- Case study labs offer a closer look at community-led art &amp\; cultural collectives\, accessible practice\, multilingual engagement\, and grassroots education\, urging us to reflect on what works\, and what must evolve.\n\nThrough the day\, participants are encouraged to question their assumptions and biases\, as well as rethink and reimagine their roles. The conference culminates with a performance rooted in lived histories at the margins\, through a Song of Ghetto by Jangama Collective.\n\nMAP’s aim is to continuously evolve\, learn and bring forth innovative\, inclusive practices. This conference is a gathering of those who believe that cultural spaces can be more inclusive\, more imaginative\, and more equitable and those who are willing to walk the talk of shaping that future together.\n\nThis year’s MAP’s 3rd Inclusion conference\, Beyond Headcount Diversity at MAP is supported by:\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nMAP’s Accessibility Partner \n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nInclusion Conference 2023\n\nInclusion Conference 2024

CATEGORIES:Film Screenings,MAP,CBD
DTSTAMP:20260129T050901Z
DESCRIPTION:This film screening series is by and for 18–25 year olds — an opportunity to share your work with a wider audience while engaging in thoughtful peer review and constructive feedback alongside fellow filmmakers in the making. If you’re a young filmmaker looking to test ideas\, spark conversations\, and build community\, this event is for you!\n\nFor this session of Stories in Motion\, we will be screening two movies - “Noor - An Interview” and “Mallipoo - A String of Jasmines”. \n\n"Noor - An Interview"\, is an excerpt from a larger body of work\, capturing the stories of individuals affected by the economic boycott of marginalised communities in Karnataka. Noor Jahan's personal account of losing her shop to the economic boycott reveals a broader impact of communal frictions triggered by extremist groups\, in various parts of the state. \n\nThis film documents the loss of a livelihood\, financial pressure\, and a senior woman's relentless struggle to support herself and her family. The boycott and forceful shutting down of her shop echoes countless similar stories of people living on the margins. It is 2026\, and Noor Jahan’s shop is still buried under endless appeals and letters to the court. She has not gotten her shop back. \n\n“Mallipoo - A String of Jasmines” looks at the invisible strings that bind Nitya’s life together\, that start to break when she\, a young IT professional in Chennai\,  has to move to a new house and confront the loss of the companionship of Lata\, her househelp. The film follows the two women as they spend the last day in Nitya’s home. As they together pack up Nitya's belongings and prepare for her departure\, a seemingly transactional relationship suddenly takes on a new meaning\, just when it is about to end.\n\nThis event is part of the Youth Engagement Series - Stories in Motion.

DESCRIPTION:This illustrated talk by Kenneth X. Robbins explores the early decades of Indian cinema\, often described as a “Golden Age”\, through the actors\, filmmakers\, and writers who shaped the industry. Featuring film clips and archival material\, the presentation highlights figures such as Sulochana\, Rose\, Ramola\, Pramila\, and Nadira\, alongside filmmaker Ezra Mir and writer Joseph David Penkar\, tracing the development of cinema’s visual language and popular appeal.\n\nThe talk briefly situates these contributions within the diverse social and professional backgrounds of early film practitioners of Indian-Jewish heritage\, offering insight into lesser-known histories of Indian cinema and the people behind it.

DESCRIPTION:The Fotobook Shāla is a community reading room designed as a space for slow reading\, shared inquiry and open conversation. A small selection of titles from Asia and beyond are presented thematically by artist Aparna Nori\, inviting participants to encounter the books with care\, engage with the tactility and material presence of books\, identify resonances and reflect on regional solidarities. \n\nIn this iteration of the reading room\, Aparna turns to the photobook as a site of the personal\, bringing together a small curation of ten photobooks by artists from across Asia. Responding to the ongoing exhibition at MAP\, Beneath the Turning Sky\, this selection of visual narratives draws attention to intimate\, everyday experiences that unfold beneath moments of social\, political\, and generational change.

DTSTAMP:20260127T042207Z
DESCRIPTION:Image credits: Reena Saini Kallat\, Hyphenated Lives (Pea-kar)\, 2015\nAcross cultures\, epochs\, and disciplines\, humans have looked to the sky not only to measure and map it\, but to situate themselves within it. The sky has functioned as calendar and compass\, myth and mathematics\, deity and diagram\, threat and shelter. It has shaped how societies imagine origins and endings\, how they organise power and humility\, and how they negotiate fate\, freedom\, and collective responsibility.\nThis workshop invites participants to move slowly through these questions in dialogue with MAP's exhibition Beneath the Turning Sky. Drawing from visual art\, cosmology\, mathematics\, speculative fiction\, Indigenous knowledge systems\, and philosophy\, the workshop deliberately blurs distinctions between science and spirituality\, abstraction and belief\, and empirical knowledge and lived experience.

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: S G Vasudev\nThis conversation brings together an artist and a curator to reflect on pedagogy and mentorship within the cultural field\, tracing how curatorial practices\, institutions\, and alternative spaces have shaped modes of expression and learning over time.\n\nMoving across questions of place\, the economics of art and notions of success\, join us to explore how knowledge is transmitted across museums\, independent initiatives\, and feminist networks of care. Foregrounding the experiences of women practitioners\, the speakers will examine curation as both a structural and ethical practice\, entangled with power\, labour\, access\, and censorship\, and ask how mentorship might be employed as a tool for equity\, solidarity\, and collective growth.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a guided walk Soundscapes of Struggle Against the Empire\, led by Manisha Tamilmani &amp\; Tanya Maheshwari from the MAP Team. This digital exhibition reads the role of sound in India’s freedom struggle by tracing its presence and movement in photographs and documents from the Mahatma Gandhi Collection.\n\nThough these materials are visual in form\, the exhibition attempts to listen to the aural traces they suggest. What emerges is a nonlinear account that shifts between public assemblies\, sound equipment\, and a covert radio experiment that bears witness to how sound shaped political action and collective experience. Lastly\, it seeks to ask “what do these soundscapes reveal and how might they attune us to listen differently?”
