DTSTAMP:20250925T120115Z
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a walkthrough of our permanent exhibition with Senior Archivist from the Archives at NCBS\, Anjali Ramachandran.\n\nWhen we encounter artworks at a museum\, we make meaning either through the work itself\, its setting\, or through labels that accompany them. Another way to read an artwork is to look for what's not in the 'frame'—to explore the circumstances of its creation and the use of the artwork\, rather than just the artwork itself.\n\nIn this guided walk\, you will get to explore our permanent exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women through the MAP Collection\, through the lens of an archivist. We will discuss the maker\, the purpose\, a specific object's relation to others\, and the broader social and historical environment in which the artworks were created. In archival sciences\, this is called contextualisation\, where archivists understand records through the varied ways in which memories (remembered or in recorded acts) have been transmitted over time and space with numerous inscriptions\, transmissions\, and omissions.\n\nAlthough it sounds technical\, the process itself can be disruptive and playful. It involves gossip\, peeking behind the curtain\, and an understanding of the complex process of making art!

DESCRIPTION:In mainstream theatre\, the stage often belongs to those who can hear. For deaf actors\, opportunities are rare but that doesn’t mean their voices are silent. On the contrary\, deaf performers bring a rich\, visual\, and deeply expressive language to the stage\, challenging traditional ideas of performance and storytelling. Their work pushes us to rethink what theatre can be when sound is not the only tool for connection.\n\nJoin us for a powerful panel discussion where deaf actors\, hearing directors\, and industry voices come together to share their stories. Discover how they communicate\, collaborate\, and reimagine inclusion/access in the world of theatre.\n\nThis event is part of the International Week of the Deaf\, presented in collaboration with MAP and Hear a Million (HAM).
