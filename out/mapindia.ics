DESCRIPTION:Discover the world of Indian Sign Language (ISL) at our inaugural ISL Jam. \n\nThis week we are celebrating the International Day of Sign Languages with a showcase of Deaf performers expressing themselves creatively through the beauty and power of sign language. Witness the fusion of art and language as performers bring their stories to life with expressive movements\, vibrant visuals\, and the unique power of ISL.\n\nThe event will begin with a sign language poetry session. Our ISL poets will use a combination of hand gestures\, facial expressions\, expressive body movements\, and sign language to subvert our conventional understanding of spoken and written poetry.\n\nThe second half of the session will involve dynamic storytelling through Visual Vernacular (VV). Unlike traditional sign language\, which focuses on factual communication\, VV involves expressive body movements\, facial expressions\, and sign language to narrate stories. \n\nSo join us for an unforgettable evening of artistic expression\, cultural celebration\, and a deeper appreciation for the power of sign language.
