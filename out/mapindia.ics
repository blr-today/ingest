DESCRIPTION:What stories do footsteps tell? \n\nSpend your Friday evening unwinding with a Kannada film screening\, followed by a discussion with the filmmaker Babu Eshwar Prasad. Inspired by 12th century Kannada poet Allama Prabhu’s vachana\, the title ‘Hariva Nadige Maiyella Kaalu’ (A Running River is all Legs) encapsulates the theme of this film which focuses on the idea of motion and walking. The film is a meditation on the act of walking through the lives of three principal characters: Kumar\, a photojournalist disenchanted with his regular job\, visits different places seeking new sources of inspiration\; Neelu\, a salesgirl in a shoe shop with a set routine\, is only interested in watching people walk\; and Amaresha\, an elderly prisoner\, alleviates his feelings of confinement by walking to imagined places within his cell. \n\nThe camera follows the gaze of the characters\, trained to different directions\, in some cases the ground and in others the sky\, experiencing how they relate to the world around them\, the minute details they observe\, and their sense of time and place. Moving between dream and reality\, the film is an exploration of the inner and outer landscapes they encounter.\n\nThis screening is in conjunction with the exhibition\, We don't end at our edges.\n\nCast: Shrunga BV\, M N Swamy\, Menaka Neotia\, Mohamed Rizvan. Dop B R Viswanath. Editing: M N Swamy\n\nImages courtesy: Moving Focus Pictures.

DESCRIPTION:Join artist\, curator and cultural thinker Suresh Jayaram and renowned Kannada filmmaker Girish Kasaravalli in an insightful conversation on the poetic and profound portrayals of women in Kasaravalli’s films. From Ghatashraddha and Thaayi Saheba\, to Dweepa and Kansemba Kudureyaneri\, women in his films are never peripheral. Rather\, the women play a central and resilient role set against the emotional\, social and political background of his films.\n\nThese backgrounds are crafted not just by dialogue\, but also through the cinematic language and grammar featuring silences and visual metaphors. Drawing from Jayaram’s background as a visual artist\, the talk will discuss how this cinematic grammar draws from other art forms of literature\, theatre and the visual arts. Together\, Kasaravalli and Jayaram will explore women’s quiet revolutions in his films\, discussing how they resist\, remember and reimagine the world.\n\nImage credits: S G Vasudev

DESCRIPTION:Song and dance have been an integral part of Indian cinema following the release of the first ever Indian talkie\, Alam Ara (1931). As the talkies caught on\, songs were\,  more often than not\, the primary reason for a film's biggest 'repeat value' factor. Little wonder\, then\, that producers wanted to highlight the musical aspect of their movies as a marketing tool. These song booklets\, costing a few annas\, were sold in cinema halls during the intermission and were extremely popular among cinegoers at the time. \n\nSong booklets were nothing less than artworks in their own right. Within their layout\, they incorporated the film's poster on their cover\, a list of its cast and crew\, the synopsis of the story\, and the lyrics of all the songs in the film. The talk by Karan Bali will shed light on how song booklets continue to serve as a valuable resource when we revisit Indian cinema history\, and aid in filling up many gaps in our archival records and thereby present novel ways of reading the archive.\n\nImage credits: Song Booklet\, Kismet (1943).
