DESCRIPTION:In collaboration with Bangalore Film Forum (BFF)\, MAP is excited to announce the screening of Yeh Woh Manzil To Nahin\, followed by a conversation facilitated by Ashish Rajadhyakhsha with Sudhir Mishra.\n\nThe plot follows three old men\, who used to be close friends during their school days\, embark on a train journey from Bombay to Rajpur to attend the centenary celebration of their boarding school. As they travel\, memories of their student activism and past failures flood their minds. Upon reaching their destination\, they are confronted by political skirmishes that serve as a stark reminder of the occasions when they had failed to stay true to their conscience.\n\nThis screening is the sixth installment of ‘The Radical Seventies\,’ a six-month series curated by Ashish Rajadhyaksha. A collaboration between MAP and Bangalore Film Forum\, the series is specially crafted for youth to engage with older classics that resonate with our contemporary times\, in familiar and unexpected ways. The Radical Seventies is part of our youth engagement programming for AUD/VID.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a presentation and discussion with Italian artists Mara Oscar Cassiani (MOC) and Ginevra Petrozzi\, currently artists in residence in Bangalore as part of Silicon Plateau— a research project and publishing series edited by Marialaura Ghidini and Tara Kelton. \n\nThe event will begin with an overview of the project\, followed by presentations by the artists on their creative practices. It will also explore the theme of Silicon Plateau’s forthcoming Volume 3: exploring the intersections of technology\, magic and ritual\, and how folklore and cultural traditions can challenge dominant digital narratives\, inspiring alternative pathways for human–algorithm collaboration.\n\nThrough distinct approaches\, Cassiani and Petrozzi engage with digital cultures\, alternative perspectives and the role of technology in shaping contemporary society. Petrozzi focuses on themes of care\, the future and algorithmic governance. \n\nEmbracing the role of a “digital witch\,” she reimagines mysticism and the occult within the context of technology and politics. Cassiani\, working across performance\, choreography\, digital media and club culture\, explores the margins of both online and offline worlds. She examines how digital platforms shape collective experience and reflects on the loss of local identity in an increasingly globalised age. \n\nJoin us as each artist draws upon ritual\, myth and digital aesthetics to question our relationship with technology and envision new possibilities for our shared realities.\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nThis event and the artist-in-residence programme are supported by The Consulate General of Italy in Bengaluru.\n\n\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an essay filmmaking workshop with Falana Films\, where they will introduce you to the essay film format and guide you in developing a short film (one to three minutes) while working with an archive.\n\nIn making your essay film\, you will have access to a curated set of artworks from the MAP Collection\, as well as a resource list of museum and other institutional archives available in the public domain. Additionally\, you will be prompted to bring your own archival material–found footage\, home videos\, family photographs\, long-lost audio recordings\, and any A/V material you feel is at the cusp of telling a story. You will also be encouraged to film additional footage throughout the workshop.\n\nThis four-day workshop extends across two weekends–February 15–16 &amp\; 22–23. Teams of four will be selected based on themes chosen by participants when they register for the workshop. These teams alongside the Falana team will work together to make the film.\n\nThe focus of this workshop is not as much on the technical aspects of filmmaking as it is on the meaning one can make from scattered archives when thematically exploring them. \n\nExpanding on the thematic concerns of MAP’s permanent exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection you can find the list of themes for the workshop below:\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n- Body as Landscape: Gender Identity\, Sexuality and Body-politics\n\n- Home and Away: Memory\, Migration and Nostalgia\n\n- No Person’s Land: Cities and Spaces \n\n- ‘Mad or What?’: Mental Health and the City\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nRead this document to find out more about the workshop\, FAQs and a tentative schedule.\n\nRegistrations for this workshop is now closed.
