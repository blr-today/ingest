DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Tram Theatre Trust\n\nDig your hands into clay\, and craft your own clay dolls! Come over to MAP\, spend time exchanging stories and experiences with professional clay doll artists from the Sunderbans\, and learn more about this indigenous craft form.\n\nHandmade dolls\, particularly clay doll-making\, have a deep relevance in human life. They strengthen connections with the natural and social environment\, reinforce relationships\, impart values and skills\, fire the creative gene\, and build a kinship between the mundane\, the mythical and the spiritual. This practice is a deeply relaxing and therapeutic process.\n\nExplore this historic craft form in this guided clay-doll making workshop with Dinesh Mondal and Ranajeet Sarkar from Manmathanagar. Generational and first-generation artists here create dolls that depict everything from fierce man-eating creatures of the Sunderbans\, everyday lives of their people\, to episodes from local folk-legends like Bonbibi and DokkhinRai. Become a part of this rich world\, and take home your own Sunderbans clay doll!\n\nPlease note: There are two sessions of this workshop. Please choose the session you want to attend on the registration link at the top of the page. Here are the dates and timings of the sessions:\n\n- Saturday\, July 5 (10:00 am - 1:00pm)\n\n- Sunday\, July 6 (10:00 am - 1:00pm)

DESCRIPTION:India is a land of Subaltern deities\, where each deity has a unique legend and these legends are often interwoven with socio-historic tropes of India.\n\nThe Puthirai vannaar  are a Dalit caste group known as the 'unseeable'\, in southern India. Their forced-occupation is to wash the clothes of other Dalits\, the dead\, and menstruating women. This film explores the tale of a young girl who grew up in the Puthirai vannaar caste group and how she came to be immortalised as their local deity\, Maadathy.\n\nDo note: This is a Tamil language film and is subtitled in English.

DESCRIPTION:Enter a world steeped in tradition\, shaped by a craft that dates back thousands of years!\n\nPutul Katha is a special showcase that invites audiences to explore the practice of doll-making in West Bengal and the cultural heritage of this unique art form. While the display mainly highlights one-of-a-kind hand-pressed clay dolls and some other variations\, the region has had a rich history of dolls being made from almost every natural material —from seeds\, leaves and wood\, to metal\, glass\, fabric\, and more. The makers’ of these artefacts were not just limited to individual artists\, but included families and even entire villages or communities\, each with their own creative expression and heritage.\n\nKnown as putul in Bengali\, these dolls not only serve as objects of play\, worship and decoration\, but also as bearers of stories. They carry their makers’ beliefs\, histories\, cultural knowledge and reflections of their everyday lives.\n\nJoin us to discover the unique history of these objects and the rich stories they tell.\n\nPutul Katha is accompanied by the following events:\n- Clay Doll-Making with Sunderbans Doll Artists\n- Maati Katha (Earth Stories) – An Object &amp\; Material Theatre Performance\n\nThis showcase is based on ongoing research by the Tram Arts Trust on the stories surrounding the doll arts of West Bengal.

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Shishir Jha\n\nIn an uranium mining area of Jharkhand\, India\, an indigenous couple copes with the loss of their daughter. For them\, the land and forest bear witness to their daughter’s memory. With great sensitivity and beauty\, the film explores the deeply intertwined connections between indigenous communities and the forest that is their traditional home. Deftly interweaving the vivid colours of their festivals\, folk songs\, and the sense of community that binds them together\, 'Tortoise Under The Earth' is a poetic elegy to a world that is rapidly disappearing\, subsumed by unchecked development and displacement.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Queer Archive for Memory\, Reflection\, and Activism (QAMRA)\, Bengaluru\n\nThis workshop brings together two powerful tools of counter-narrative—art and the queer archive—to explore how we can use them in tandem to tell stories of our own. Together\, as participants and facilitators\, we will experiment with ways of broadening our relationship with history\, critically examining the present\, and imagining the futures we hope for and work towards.\n\nThrough a series of hands-on exercises and discussions\, we will explore three key themes:\n\nPreservation\n- What do we choose to preserve\, and how? We will engage with a range of materials to think about preservation both practically and politically.\n\nOrganisation\n- How does the structure of memory storage shape how it is understood? We’ll reflect on different archival logics and the possibilities of queering archival organisation\n\nAccess\n- How do we dream through the archive? We’ll imagine the audiences of the future and consider how we want our saved materials to speak to them.\n\nThis workshop is an invitation to think\, feel\, and make within the space of collective memory and queer futurity.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:From dancing elephants and beloved deities\, to steamships and radiators\, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery. These labels arrived in Indian markets in the thousands\, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India)\, and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire\, memory\, and meaning into the act of purchase.\n\nThe exhibition\, Ticket Tika Chaap\, explores these textile labels known as tikats (tickets)\, tikas or chaaps\, and their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in India.\n\nPlease note: This guided walk\, will be conducted in Kannada by Rajesh from the MAP Team.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Join artist Vivek Mariappan as he shares insights into his photographic practice\, in connection to his work As Close As It Gets. The work explores the emotional resonance of built spaces and how environments shape—and are simultaneously shaped by—personal memory. Tracing a journey that began with a residency in Sweden in 2019 and continues in his hometown of Erode\, Tamil Nadu\, Mariappan uses photography to map\, connect\, and make sense of place.\n\nIn this talk\, he reflects on how his recent work extends and weaves together two earlier projects into an ongoing exploration of space\, distance\, and belonging.

DESCRIPTION:Have we ever truly seen our mothers rest? Why does their labour so often go unnoticed? How do acts of care and resistance shape the lives of women across generations?\n\nJoin us for a workshop that holds space to explore these questions\, the politics of rest\, and everyday resistance. Through collaborative exercises and open dialogue\, we will share experiences\, reimagine dominant narratives\, and reflect on the invisible labour that sustains communities. Together\, we will examine the role of community and feminist solidarity in fostering connection and inspiring collective action.\n\nThe session includes a walkthrough of the Sasken digital exhibition\, Mindscapes: In the company of others.\n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Rajesh PI\n\nThis workshop\, facilitated by Anshul Jhambani\, offers an immersive journey into improvisational theatre\, specially designed for the LGBTQIA+ community members. Theatre is built on many elements\, but at its core lies the actor’s greatest resources: Their own body\, voice\, and imagination.\n\nExplore how storytelling and improvisation come alive\, not just through words\, but through gestures\, expressions\, and movement. This experience nudges the boundaries of observation and emotional response\, inviting us to transform true stories into spontaneous performances. Come\, play with us\, and discover the many ways we see ourselves reflected in art and in each other.\n\nThis workshop is presented in conjunction with MAP’s ongoing exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection.
