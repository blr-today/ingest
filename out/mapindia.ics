DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wondered what poetry would look like if it could transcend words and take form as sculptures? Jaume Plensa\, the celebrated visual artist and sculptor\, invites you to explore this unique concept through his remarkable works. From Dream (2009) to the Crown Fountain (2004) and Together (2015)\, Plensa's creations transform physical and visual art into a language of poetry—art that speaks volumes about itself without words.  \n\nJoin us for a special evening at MAP to meet and hear from Jaume Plensa\, whose work is seen in museums and public spaces across the world from installations in London and New York to Taipei and Dubai. Discover what drives his practice\, his approach to art and the role he imagines it plays in the world.
