DESCRIPTION:When you see a fascinating painting that you want to know more about\, it's almost instinctive to look to the side and find the label that explains it! Labels provide essential information about an exhibit\, such as the artist's name\, title of the work\, date of creation\, medium or materials used and collection or loan information.\n\nIn this workshop\, participants get to create such descriptive labels for artworks in the exhibition Vaanyerum Vizhuthugal: Roots that Reach for the Sky. The exhibition's overarching themes of identity address complex topics such as caste histories\, domestic violence\, and queer identity\, among others.\n\nLearn to create detailed text that provides additional context and information about the exhibit\, adding images\, colours\, and more.\n\nThis event is a part of the International Museum Day programming.
