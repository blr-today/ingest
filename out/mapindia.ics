DESCRIPTION:Image credits: Harkat Studios\nFragments of unfinished verses swirl in an orbit\, finding their way to each other\, bewitched. They dance for a while\, hand in hand\, and then drop to the ground- to catch a breath\, a smile\, a moment in time\; to sit together. Content. Then they get up to dance again before they say their goodbyes.\n\nImages from the past\, present and future\, all collide to construct wild imaginations. Colors form\, hide and show. Pass through images\, like shadows of clouds. Fleeting. They meet each other in dark alleys\, and kiss\, and melt. Like a flirt with the mysticism of cinema.\n\nUsing two 16mm projectors with a live projectionist-performer\, this performance explores visual juxtapositions and photochemical experiments\, blending theatre\, mechanics\, and chemistry into a playful exploration of what film can be.\n\nPerformed by Karan Suri Talwar\nMusic by Baan\n\nHarkat Crew for Sound and Additional Visuals: Tanvi Chitre\, Keyuri Bhogale \nOriginally devised with Namrata and Simran\, Harkat Lab.

DESCRIPTION:Image credits: Harkat Studios\nWork hands-on with 16mm film in this tactile exploration of analog cinema. Using found footage as your raw material\, you'll learn to cut\, splice\, and manipulate existing imagery to create something entirely new.\n\nThis workshop introduces fundamental analog techniques—from physical film editing to creative projection methods—while exploring how appropriation and abstraction can breathe new life into archival images. You'll experiment with projection as both a screening method and a creative tool in its own right.\n\nThe workshop culminates in a collaborative expanded cinema performance\, where all participants will present their collective 16mm work.\n\nThis workshop is part of Collection (film ephemera) programming

DESCRIPTION:David Szanton\, President of the Ethnic Art Foundation (EAF) and a published author\, looks at the long-term evolution of Mithila paintings from a domestic ritual tradition\, to an indigenous art form with a continually expanding repertoire. This illustrated talk looks at contemporary practitioners\, their use of style or form and how they get translated into immediate relevant subjects.  He will discuss the significant shift in the art form's evolution in the late 1960s\, when paper became a primary medium\, and examine the diverse range of artists and styles that have emerged since. Szanton will also shed light on the Ethnic Art Foundation's (EAF) crucial role in promoting and popularising Mithila Paintings.

DESCRIPTION:Image credits: Harkat Studios\nThe possibilities of cinema are endless\, and one of the most liberating roads one can take is to make moving images without cameras\, lenses\, or editing programs.\n\nWe invite you to step into a world where you interact with the materiality of film directly—where images are made using craft materials\, plants\, and photochemistry. In this workshop\, you will get hands-on knowledge of tinting and toning film\, scratching and frame-by-frame animation\, phytograms\, collage-making with film\, and more.\n\nWatch your short creations on a 16mm projector and take home a little souvenir!\n\nThis workshop is part of Collection (film ephemera) programming
