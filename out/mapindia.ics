DTSTAMP:20260120T090133Z
DESCRIPTION:If we imagine inclusion in the arts and cultural sector as a landscape we have been mapping intuitively—sometimes through deliberation and by asking important questions such as: Did we do our best to make access equal for all? Did we push through collaboratively? Did we slow down to listen and evolve? And when did we realise that the map itself needed to be redrawn?\n\nThe Inclusion Conference has always been MAP’s attempt to ask these questions openly. What began in 2023 as a gathering to think about accessibility in cultural organisations\, has grown into an annual space where practitioners\, educators\, activists\, artists\, and community leaders convene to reflect on inclusive practices that shape the art &amp\; cultural spaces. Not merely as a value\, but also a practice informed by the unique perspectives of historically marginalised and underrepresented communities.\n\nYear after year\, MAP’s Inclusion conference has examined these questions from different vantage points: First\, through the lens of funding\, then through the systems and structures that enable or restrict those opportunities. In this third edition\, we turn our attention to measurement not as a checkbox\, but as a way of understanding whether our intentions translate into meaningful change.\n\nTo explore this\, the conference brings together voices who work at the intersections of justice\, care\, community organising\, and cultural practice:\n- Through fireside conversations\, we unpack how identities shape our understanding of culture and belonging.\n- Workshops guide participants through nuances of recognising unconscious bias\, navigating conflict\, and cinema poster politics of caste and gender.\n- Case study labs offer a closer look at community-led art &amp\; cultural collectives\, accessible practice\, multilingual engagement\, and grassroots education\, urging us to reflect on what works\, and what must evolve.\n\nThrough the day\, participants are encouraged to question their assumptions and biases\, as well as rethink and reimagine their roles. The conference culminates with a performance rooted in lived histories at the margins\, through a Song of Ghetto by Jangama Collective.\n\nMAP’s aim is to continuously evolve\, learn and bring forth innovative\, inclusive practices. This conference is a gathering of those who believe that cultural spaces can be more inclusive\, more imaginative\, and more equitable and those who are willing to walk the talk of shaping that future together.\n\nThis year’s MAP’s 3rd Inclusion conference\, Beyond Headcount Diversity at MAP is supported by:\n\n&nbsp\;\n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nMAP’s Accessibility Partner \n\n\n\n&nbsp\;\n\nInclusion Conference 2023\n\nInclusion Conference 2024

DTSTAMP:20260120T040100Z
DESCRIPTION:This illustrated talk by Kenneth X. Robbins explores the early decades of Indian cinema\, often described as a “Golden Age”\, through the actors\, filmmakers\, and writers who shaped the industry. Featuring film clips and archival material\, the presentation highlights figures such as Sulochana\, Rose\, Ramola\, Pramila\, and Nadira\, alongside filmmaker Ezra Mir and writer Joseph David Penkar\, tracing the development of cinema’s visual language and popular appeal.\n\nThe talk briefly situates these contributions within the diverse social and professional backgrounds of early film practitioners of Indian-Jewish heritage\, offering insight into lesser-known histories of Indian cinema and the people behind it.

DESCRIPTION: Image credit- Submergence village\, Rohit Jain\n\nThe exhibition Beneath the Turning Sky invites us to reflect on: How do our choices shape the world\, our communities\, and all others with whom we share the world? \n\nAs part of this exhibition\, Nandini Oza\, former activist of the Narmada Bachao Andolan and an oral historian\, will conduct a session exploring how the mega dam–based development model has irrevocably impacted the ecology of the river valley\, as well as the culture\, traditions\, languages\, and everyday lives of people living along the banks of this mighty river and those displaced by the dam.\n\nFollowed by a question-and-answer session and a participatory exercise to explore how oral history as a methodology is significant in a country like India\, where many languages have no written script and where knowledge\, memory\, and wisdom are often transmitted orally. The workshop will highlight the importance of oral history in documenting and preserving our rich heritage\, environment and cultural diversity. \n\nThis event is part of Beneath the Turning Sky programming.

Six years after dismissing that occurrence as a malady of the summer heat\, he finds a note left behind in a photo archive about the very same woman. He begins another journey in search of that woman\, following the scent of absence in the photographs of the archive. \n\nThe screening will be followed by a conversation with the filmmaker Karthik Subramanian\, facilitated by Aayati Sengupta from the exhibitions team at MAP. \n\n\n\nThis event is part of Beneath the Turning Sky programming.

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: S G Vasudev\nThis conservation brings together an artist and a curator to reflect on pedagogy and mentorship within the cultural field\, tracing how curatorial practices\, institutions\, and alternative spaces have shaped modes of expression and learning over time.\n\nMoving across questions of place\, the economics of art and notions of success\, join us to explore how knowledge is transmitted across museums\, independent initiatives\, and feminist networks of care. Foregrounding the experiences of women practitioners\, the speakers will examine curation as both a structural and ethical practice\, entangled with power\, labour\, access\, and censorship\, and ask how mentorship might be employed as a tool for equity\, solidarity\, and collective growth.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a guided walk Soundscapes of Struggle Against the Empire\, led by Manisha Tamilmani &amp\; Tanya Maheshwari from the MAP Team. This digital exhibition reads the role of sound in India’s freedom struggle by tracing its presence and movement in photographs and documents from the Mahatma Gandhi Collection.\n\nThough these materials are visual in form\, the exhibition attempts to listen to the aural traces they suggest. What emerges is a nonlinear account that shifts between public assemblies\, sound equipment\, and a covert radio experiment that bears witness to how sound shaped political action and collective experience. Lastly\, it seeks to ask “what do these soundscapes reveal and how might they attune us to listen differently?”
