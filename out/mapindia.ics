DESCRIPTION:Join us for a screening of Molkarin (1981) by the film collective Yugantar. The screening will be followed by a conversation between Deepa Dhanraj\, independent documentary filmmaker and co-founder of Yugantar\, and Geeta Menon\, co-founder of Stree Jagruti Samiti—an organisation based in Bangalore that works with domestic workers to advocate for their labour rights and employment benefits.\n\nMolkarin exposes the oppressive working conditions of thousands of domestic workers in Pune. Through re-enactments of significant moments of the original process of unionising\, the film narrates the coming together of women workers and union activists to form the Pune Shahar Molkarin Sanghatana (Pune City Domestic Workers Union) to fight for their rights. Their unionising process\, reflections on their work conditions and the myriad new questions raised that went beyond issues of work and payment drew the attention of many. Feminist activists from different backgrounds were inspired\, joined and supported the struggle. \n\nThe Yugantar collective\, too\, recognised this as a moment that allowed deeper explorations of feminist consciousness across class and caste. As Yugantar’s first film\, Molkarin inaugurates the group’s focus on the power of processes of collectivisation\, through gathering on the streets\, spontaneous strike actions\, organised assemblies and long meetings - sitting together sharing experiences\, debating\, strategising\, arguing and laughing. Domestic workers\, mainly Dalit and rural migrants to the city\, reflect on their low payment\, their lack of security and the normalised humiliating behaviour of their employers\, exposing also the participation of middle-class women in working-class women’s oppression.\n\nThis film is part of the programme for Naam Mera Kaam ka Nahi\, a digital story from the series Frames of Struggle: Tracing a Movement\, a collaboration between the Museum of Art &amp\; Photography (MAP) and Zubaan that activates the Poster Women archive.\n\nImage Credit: Navroze Contractor

DESCRIPTION:How has the invisible labour of women been made visible over the past four decades? \n\nWomen’s reproductive\, emotional and care labour as well as productive labour at home\, on the farm\, and in the factory continue to be unacknowledged\, uncounted and underpaid. Alongside the demand to recognise women’s work in the household\, feminists challenged the rigid sexual division of labour\, especially within the home. The third digital story of MAP’s collaboration with Zubaan’s Poster Women archive\, titled Naam Mera Kaam ka Nahi (No Name for My Work)\, is centred around the processes by which women’s movements in India were shaped through the on-ground mobilisation of working-class and middle-class women. \n\nJoin us for a guided walk of  Naam Mera Kaam ka Nahi\, a digital story\, led by curator Laxmi Murthy\, where she takes you through this selection of posters looking at women’s labour. \n\nThis is the third digital story from the series Frames of Struggle: Tracing a Movement\, a collaboration between the Museum of Art &amp\; Photography (MAP) and Zubaan that activates the Poster Women archive.\n\nImage Courtesy: Poster Women archive\, Zubaan
