DESCRIPTION:How do the arts inspire and illuminate each other? Discover the answer to this question through an engaging conversation with acclaimed author Shoba Narayan and celebrated dancer Madhu Nataraj as they both delve into the dynamic intersections of art and dance. Exploring the syncretic magic that emerges from the cross-illumination of the arts\, this discussion will reveal how the spacio-temporality of dance becomes a canvas for collaborations\, sparking innovations in art\, literature\, and beyond.\n\nShoba Narayan\, a James Beard Award-winning author and journalist\, brings her deep insights from three decades of storytelling\, global lecturing\, and creative ventures. Madhu Nataraj\, known for her groundbreaking choreography and interdisciplinary work\, adds a dancer’s perspective to this creative dialogue. Together\, they illuminate the threads that weave art forms together across time and space.\n\nMAP is delighted to be a part of BLR Hubba 2024\, a city-wide arts and culture festival.\n\n
