DESCRIPTION: Iss anjuman me aapko aana hai baar baar\n\n Deewar-o-dar ko gaur se pehchan lijiye \n\nCome to this gathering again and again\n\nLearn to recognise these surroundings carefully\n\nOur latest digital exhibition\, Tawaif: Tracing the History of Courtesans in Hindi Cinema\, invites you to explore the many facets that make the tawaif character in hindi cinema.\n\nDr. Saumya Mani Tripathi\, who has also curated this exhibition\, will guide you through the history and evolution of the tawaif (courtesan) in Hindi cinema\, showcasing the latest exhibition to come out of our Bollywood Ephemera digitisation efforts. \n\nTawaif: Tracing the History of Courtesans in Hindi Cinema examines the transformation of the courtesan figure in cinema from a court dancer steeped in devotion to kings and deities\, to a complex figure who defies and critiques societal conventions — ultimately evolving into a feminist icon\, poet\, and artist.  \n\nThrough the lens of films such as Pakeezah\, Utsav\, Mughal-e-Azam\, and Mere Mehboob it showcases the work of cinematic legends like Madhubala\, Meena Kumari\, Rekha\, and Waheeda Rehman\, who brought the tawaif figure to the silver screen with unparalleled grace and emotional depth. \n\nAfter the walkthrough\, we will delve deeper into the exhibition's themes with a showcase of objects from the MAP collection such as vintage lobby cards\, film posters and vinyl records. These objects provide a tangible connection to the time period\, the lives of tawaifs\, and the cultural memory of Hindi  Cinema's timeless legacy.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to immerse yourself in the allure of classic Hindi cinema and discover the enduring legacy of the tawaif.\n\nMAP is grateful to Richa and Jamshed Chinoy for gifting this collection.\n\nThe exhibition has been made possible in partnership with Bank of America  \n\n&nbsp\;

DESCRIPTION:There is art hidden everywhere\, and when you view it with an artist's vision\, it suddenly becomes evident\, as if it had been in plain sight all along. Discover the stories that can be found within a piece of wood by closely examining artworks at our latest exhibition Painting with Fire\, and join us for a sketching workshop led by Penciljam.\n\nPainting with Fire\, features the art of Jeram Patel and Tarik Currimbhoy\, who both use fire on wood to present the unique possibilities  concealed within pieces of wood.\n\nThis method of creating art can be seen in light of what may stem from the material or process. Some sculptors\, for instance\, describe their process as chipping away at marble to reveal the sculpture hidden inside or game artists who build characters starting from random squiggles of ink.\n\nIn this session\, we will explore this unique human ability to create meaningful forms and interpretations out of seemingly random shapes. We will discover how artistic vision utilises both chance and skill to create art.\n\n\nWhat you need to Bring along\n\n- A sketchbook\n- A Black Gel Pen / Micron / Pigment Liner\n- A Black Brush Pen (Optional)\n\nIf you would like to register for our 4:00PM session click here.

DTSTAMP:20240917T110528Z
DESCRIPTION:How can a sense of agency\, care and respect influence the experience of childbirth? This panel discussion explores the importance of respect and dignity in maternal healthcare\, focusing on the experiences of women during pregnancy and childbirth in India. \n\nThe artwork Mother and Child 2 by Nilima Sheikh offers a powerful visual representation of the maternal experience. It depicts a mother and her newborn\, appearing as if they were drawn with a single\, continuous line. The larger series that this painting is a part of\, captures moments of the mother holding\, nursing\, and steadying her child – telling of the deep bond between them. However\, the subtle hints of wounds and tears on the mother's body in this painting remind us of the physical and emotional challenges women face during childbirth.\n\nJoin us for a discussion that delves into the current state of maternal care\, addressing the challenges that women face in healthcare settings and the stigma that surrounds their experiences in the maternal healthcare landscape. This discussion will cover public and private sectors but with a special focus on public sector hospitals.\n\nOur panellists\, Dr Janhavi Nilekani\, Mandira Kalra Kalaan\, and Jamuna L\, will be in conversation with Anoushaka Chandrashekar. They will also address the role of advocacy\, awareness\, and outreach in transforming maternity care practices.\n\nThis event is conceptualised under our exhibition VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection.
