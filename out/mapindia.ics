DESCRIPTION:Join us for a delightful talk that unravels the enchanting world of ‘Colchas\,’ exquisite embroidered textiles from the MAP collection! Colchas are decorative textiles\, often characterized by elaborate embroidery or stitching\, that originated in Portugal and were later embraced and transformed in Latin America. The term "colcha" translates to "bedspread" or "coverlet\," and these textiles were traditionally used as bed coverings or wall hangings. \n\nGuided by textile collector Jeevak Parpia\, this session promises to take you on a journey through the intricate visual storytelling that defines these extraordinary artifacts. Discover the unique motifs woven into each ‘colcha’\, and their deep cultural and historical resonance. \n\nWith his wealth of expertise\, Mr. Parpia will talk on the artistic traditions and cross-cultural exchanges that shaped these textiles\, tracing their roots from Portugal to Latin America\, how colchas became a canvas for storytelling\, reflecting the lives\, beliefs\, and aspirations of their makers.

DESCRIPTION:“Nervy\, daring\, properly transgressive\, Night in Delhi is Indian fiction remade\, with nothing to prove and nothing to lose.” — Jeet Thayil\n\nJoin us for the launch of Ranbir Sidhu’s latest novel\, Night in Delhi\, followed by a discussion with the author. In a devastating portrait\, Ranbir Sidhu's Night in Delhi invites us into a city and its underworld where at any moment the ground might collapse beneath you\n\nAbout the book-Night in Delhi\n\nThere are no good people here. And perhaps no truly evil ones. A small-time thief and hustler and his lover and pimp\, who is a rising star in Delhi's music scene. A lost American and acolyte of a so-called guru. A young woman who hopes to save herself by becoming a boss in one of India's new mafias. And everyone floating in a world of shades of grey.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an essay filmmaking workshop with Falana Films\, where they will introduce you to the essay film format and guide you in developing a short film (one to three minutes) while working with an archive.\n\nIn making your essay film\, you will have access to a curated set of artworks from the MAP Collection\, as well as a resource list of museum and other institutional archives available in the public domain.

Teams of four will be selected based on themes chosen by participants when they register for the workshop.
