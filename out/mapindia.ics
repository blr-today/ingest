DESCRIPTION:Join this two-day workshop of creative inquiry and narrative experimentation where you engage with MAP’s latest exhibition\, Beneath the Turning Sky. In the workshop\, you will make your own short video works\, responding to the exhibition through close looking\, interpretation and poetic translation. Led by writer and sound researcher Mishika Goel\, the workshop offers the space to reflect on how art can be re-encountered\, re-imagined\, and articulated through new narrative forms.\n\nDrawing from her experiences in France and her creative process behind Prochaine Station: Aristide Briand\, Mishika reflects on narrative as both method and medium. The workshop\, situated at the intersection of language\, moving image\, and curatorial encounter\, explores how artworks generate meaning beyond the visual- prompting stories\, gestures\, and varied forms of response..\n\nThis workshop is part of the ongoing series\, Responding to Art through the Arts. Facilitated by arts practitioners\, it aims to activate MAP’s galleries through a series of workshops that hold space for young people’s responses to artwork on display. \n\nIt is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective - a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.\n\nWorkshop requirements: Open to all skill levels\, any phone camera/professional camera can be used.

DESCRIPTION:Image Courtesy: SAF\, Goa \nJoin us for a Visual Vernacular (VV) performance by Deaf performer Benin\, followed by an ISL poetry session by Hardeep Singh from the MAP team.\n\nVisual Vernacular (VV) is a dynamic form of visual storytelling used in deaf culture. It involves expressive body movements and facial expressions to convey complex narratives and emotions\, emphasising dramatic and artistic elements. Unlike traditional sign language\, which focuses on factual communication\, VV creates vivid\, engaging\, and multi-dimensional stories. \n\nISL Poetry is a visual form of expression that uses handshapes\, movement\, facial expressions\, and space instead of spoken words. Meaning is created through rhythm\, repetition\, and emotion in the body. Rather than being translated from spoken language\, ISL poetry is composed in the language itself\, celebrating Deaf culture and the expressive power of Indian Sign Language.\n\nThis performance is held in conjunction with our exhibition\, mild tooth of milk\, currently on display at the Dutch Warehouse in Fort Kochi.\n\nThis series of programs is hosted in collaboration with the Kerala Museum.

DESCRIPTION:Image Credits: Alexander Burnes\, Bamiyan Buddhas\, print 1834\nAir-dried clay stands among South Asia’s oldest and most widely used mediums for sculpture\, along with stone\, metal\, wood\, and fired clay. Typically finished in vivid colour\, the medium has been largely overlooked in studies of the region’s arts\, often misidentified as stucco and terracotta\, or sidelined as too breakable and exuberantly coloured to be “art”’.\n\nThis talk brings together some of the most prominent practices across the subcontinent to consider why painted\, air-dried clay has been so valued as a medium for figural sculpture\, and what its sidelining reveals about the study of art and visual culture.

DESCRIPTION:It’s game time at Ticket Tika Chaap! Come and discover the art of Indo-British textile trademarks through riddles. This exhibition explores textile labels\, known as tikats (tickets)\, tikas or chaaps\, and their art-historical and commercial significance\, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement\, in the 19th and 20th century global colonial market.\n\nIntricately designed\, these labels carry nuanced stories within them. This is your chance to decode its narrative—the more clues you find\, the closer you get to victory.

DESCRIPTION:Bharatanatyam is often called the dance of the cosmic god Nataraja in common parlance\, but a deeper look into history of the making of Bharatanatyam shows this narrative was engineered to erase the courtly origins of the dance form.\n\nNrithya Pillai's dance is about centering these erased hereditary histories—something she is a part of on account of her identity as being from these families whose performance was criminalised. The most common feature of “hereditary dance” is that the songs are themed around love\, and if there is one mythological figure who occupied a significant place in Bharatanatyam repertoire it was the God of Desire—Manmatha\, Maaran\, Kama\, Madhana.\n\nThis performance will showcase pieces from the hereditary repertoire that bring focus onto the themes of love\, and the poetic beauty of the imagery of how Manmatha is portrayed in these love songs.
