DESCRIPTION:Join us for a walkthrough of our permanent exhibition with Senior Archivist at the Archives at NCBS\, Anjali Ramachandran.\n\nWhen we encounter artworks at a museum\, we make meaning either through the work itself\, its setting\, or through labels that accompany them. Another way to read an artwork is to look for what's not in the 'frame'—to explore the circumstances of its creation and the use of the artwork\, rather than just the artwork itself.\n\nIn this guided walk\, you will get to explore our permanent exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women through the MAP Collection\, through the lens of an archivist. We will discuss the maker\, the purpose\, a specific object's relation to others\, and the broader social and historical environment in which the artworks were created. In archival sciences\, this is called contextualisation\, where archivists understand records through the varied ways in which memories (remembered or in recorded acts) have been transmitted over time and space with numerous inscriptions\, transmissions\, and omissions.\n\nAlthough it sounds technical\, the process itself can be disruptive and playful. It involves gossip\, peeking behind the curtain\, and an understanding of the complex process of making art!

No prior training in music is required—just a willingness to listen\, respond\, and discover the harmony between sound\, form\, and emotion.\n\nThis event is in conjunction with the exhibition\, Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.\n\nFacilitated by arts practitioners\, Responding to Art through the Arts aims to activate our galleries through a series of workshops that hold space for young people’s responses to artwork on display. \n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector.
