DESCRIPTION:Reading and writing are verbs we use to describe texts. What if we deploy these terms to images\, and to how we interpret them? What would that gesture look and feel like? Would it enhance or deplete our aesthetic experience?\n\nCome explore a sociological perspective of our permanent exhibition\, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection with Dr Gita Chadha\, a feminist sociologist who will take us through how we might read and write meanings to the artworks. Come prepared with your thoughts on art\, gender and the relationship between the two!

DESCRIPTION:Mark-making—the use of lines\, dots\, patterns\, and textures in art—ranges from loose\, gestural strokes to tight\, controlled details. It is a deeply personal and instinctive process\, with every mark carrying energy\, emotion\, and intention. This hands-on workshop led by Sindhu Kulkarni\, explores the expressive potential of mark-making as a fundamental element of visual storytelling and design. Participants will engage in guided exercises that encourage spontaneity\, rhythm\, and composition through diverse tools and materials. The session will focus on the physicality of marks—how gestures\, textures\, and repetition contribute to form and meaning\n\nThere are no right or wrong marks\, only discoveries waiting to unfold. As you explore different tools and surfaces\, you’ll find that each stroke adds to your visual language\, shaping how you see and express the world around you. \n\nDesigned for artists\, designers\, and creative enthusiasts\, this workshop invites you to experiment freely\, embrace the unexpected\, and discover new ways of seeing and creating.\n\nThis workshop is part of the opening of We Don’t End At Our Edges exhibition programming.

DESCRIPTION:Join us for an evening of art\, vision\, and conversation as designer Janak Mistry sits down with Rustam Vania to discuss DEEP SEE — a captivating visual journey through India’s vibrant diversity.\n\nWhat began as casual snapshots on the streets over a decade ago with Janak Mistry’s first smartphone has evolved into a book reflecting various perspectives.\n\nIn DEEP SEE\, Janak Mistry captures ordinary sights to encourage people to discover the extraordinary in the everyday. All images in this book were taken with a mobile phone\, focusing not on perfection but on seizing fleeting moments. The book showcases a unique vision that transforms the mundane into the remarkable\, with playful\, nonlinear texts revealing multiple layers of reality in each image.\n\nBe part of a thought-provoking conversation on art\, vision\, and the power of mobile photography.
