DESCRIPTION:Zines have long been spaces for reflection\, resistance and reclaiming stories. In this workshop with writer-illustrator Preston Olakatu\, explore zine-making as a creative act of self-expression — one that holds space for personal narratives\, queerness and community.\n\nThe workshop will begin with a short presentation covering the history and cultural significance of zines\, tracing their roots from punk and feminist movements to present-day DIY publishing. \n\nWith an emphasis on experimentation\, create your own zine exploring different formats while learning techniques such as layering\, sequencing and layout structure.

DESCRIPTION:Drummer\, Tyeb Mehta\, 1988\, Oil on canvas\, MAC.00459\nThis month\, we tune into the unsettling acoustics of conflict. The Drone Eats with Me\, a personal diary by Atef Abu Saif offers an intimate\, harrowing perspective from Gaza - where the whir of drones and sudden explosions become a permanent soundtrack to daily life. As Palestinians recall lives interrupted\, the soundscape of war becomes etched into memory.\n\nBut what about those of us who watch from a distance? In Silence on Trial\, Paul Virilio confronts the uncomfortable reality of spectatorship in the age of immersive media. When war becomes another stream in our feed\, at what point does our silence become complicity\, or worse -  erasure?\n\nJoin us as we examine the acoustics of war\, the politics of silence\, and what it means to truly listen.\n\nThe Reader’s Bloc is an online/IRL group of readers taking part in reading\, listening and sharing exercises around texts that help us learn more about ourselves\, the identities we share and the communities we live in.\n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for\, of and by young people — to explore our shared identities and interests through art.
