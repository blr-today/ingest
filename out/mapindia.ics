DESCRIPTION:How do the arts inspire and illuminate each other? Discover the answer to this question through an engaging conversation with acclaimed author Shoba Narayan and celebrated dancer Madhu Nataraj as they both delve into the dynamic intersections of art and dance. Exploring the syncretic magic that emerges from the cross-illumination of the arts\, this discussion will reveal how the spacio-temporality of dance becomes a canvas for collaborations\, sparking innovations in art\, literature\, and beyond.\n\nShoba Narayan\, a James Beard Award-winning author and journalist\, brings her deep insights from three decades of storytelling\, global lecturing\, and creative ventures. Madhu Nataraj\, known for her groundbreaking choreography and interdisciplinary work\, adds a dancer’s perspective to this creative dialogue. Together\, they illuminate the threads that weave art forms together across time and space.\n\nMAP is delighted to be a part of BLR Hubba 2024\, a city-wide arts and culture festival.\n\n

DESCRIPTION:How do we interpret the visual records of company paintings in our contemporary world? Join us for a workshop where you can create your own miniature portrait inspired by mica paintings.\n\nThe mica paintings in our latest exhibition\, The Forgotten Souvenir\, represent a nearly forgotten chapter in Indian art — bridging the gap between the decline of traditional miniature paintings and the rise of photography.\n\nAfter a short guided walk of the exhibition\, you will learn to design and curate your own portrait. Using OHP sheets and filters\, you can pick and choose the elements you would like to add to your portrait. This interactive session will engage with the mica paintings of the exhibition through the aspects of transparency and portraiture. \n\n&nbsp\;\n\nAll materials for this workshop will be provided by MAP. This workshop is for individuals above the age of 16.
