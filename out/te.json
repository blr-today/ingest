Informed by Carnatic training,\nexperimental composition, and cross-genre collaboration, Prakash treats melody\nas both a spiritual and social force. His singing moves fluidly between raga\narticulation, timbral exploration, spoken text, and wordless sound. His\ncompositions function as open frameworks, inviting deep listening, instinctive\nresponse, and continual reinvention in performance.",
