    "description": "We scouted this new route on the back of our existing and very popular Nandi Countryside curation. A part of it is a hark back to the time when Nandi was but a little village with a pretty little train station in the early 1900's. Other parts are an exploration of the interior dirt tracks that run through vineyards and flower farms, and beside several lakes, most notably the one in Avati that sits beside a rocky shrub forest. We've even thrown in a short but sweet climb up a little hillock, with lovely views of the region from the top. This action-packed cycling adventure combines these elements in a way that you can appreciate them all in just a few hours on a Sunday morning. Why should cycling be reduced to the drudgery of unchanging and mindnumbing roads, set on repeat?Meeting Time: 5:45 amMeeting Point: Nandi Upachar Level-2 ride:Ride Distance: 45-50 kmCumulative Elevation Gain: 400 mLevel-3 ride:Ride Distance: 60-65 kmCumulative Elevation Gain: 500 m\n{'DISTANCE': '55-75KM', 'MIN.

    "description": "Join our Sound of Gravel ride and experience what it's like to ride on gravel routes. What do these routes have in common with all our other routes? Well, they are just as deep in the countryside, away from traffic and the bustle of the city. Sometimes more. And they're almost completely off tarmac roads. These gravel routes vary from hard-packed dirt to smooth small-pebbled surfaces (which is actually known as gravel) that are non-technical but engaging, and smooth enough to do on a gravel or hybrid bike, typically bikes with 32mm or more tyres. Sure, you can do them on a mountain bike too. Road bikers-you need a steely pair to manoeuvre on these routes on your 25mm or 28mm slicks!Gravel:\"small, rounded stones, often mixed with sand.\" ~ Cambridge dictionary. \"aggregate of more or less rounded rock fragments coarser than sand (i.e., more than 2 mm [0.08 inch] in diameter).\"~ Britannica. Gravel Riding Explained:\"The \u2018gravel\u2019 discipline tends to describe riding a drop-bar bike on unpaved roads and trails, fitting somewhere between road cycling and mountain biking. In this case, the clue isn\u2019t really in the name \u2013 gravel riding can encompass all types of terrain, from actual gravel to wooded singletrack and everything in between.As we\u2019ll come on to, versatility is key when it comes to gravel bikes, and that extends to gravel riding as a whole. From super-chilled social rides to remote and demanding endurance racing, mass-participation events to dirt touring, there\u2019s something in gravel for everyone.\"~Bike Radar .\n\n{'DISTANCE': '25-40KM', 'MIN.

The climbs in the level-2 and level-3 route variations in this region are challenging, with some exhilarating descents. You will experience riding on quiet traffic-free forest and village roads, that run beside a couple of pristine lakes and dams.
