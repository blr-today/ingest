      "The Arkavati is an important river in Karnataka, originating at Nandi Hills, north of Bangalore in the Chikkabalapur District, and flowing down south through Ramanagara and Kanakapura. It then joins the Kaveri river further south, at Sangama. It forms several waterfalls on its journey, some small, and some large like the Chunchi falls. The region around the southern leg of this river is forested, and either adjoins or is part of one these protected areas - Nandi State Forest, Bannerghatta National Park, Basavanabetta State Forest amd Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. Our routes skirt around these forests and pass through the many agricultural villages nestled between forest land. The Arkavathi and it's many shades of blue will be in view during several sections of the ride. This is a meticulously crafted adventure cycling tour that combines these elements perfectly - the scenic countryside route, a picnic breakfast, a buffet lunch after the ride, all the support you need during the ride, and a fun group of riders to keep you company from the incredible Pedal in Tandem community!",
