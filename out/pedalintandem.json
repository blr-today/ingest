    "description": "Our route for this half-day tour weaves through the hills and lush forests around Nandi. We have curated rides of difficulty different levels in the region. The level-1 ride charts out a fairly easy route through some flat terrain while still touching upon several scenic spots. The climbs in the level-2 and level-3 route variations in this region are challenging, with some exhilarating descents. You will experience riding on quiet traffic-free forest and village roads, that run beside a couple of pristine lakes and dams. All the joys of bicycle touring wrapped into a few hours of riding.\n \n\n{'DISTANCE': '30-65KM', 'MIN. GROUP SIZE': '10', 'ELEVATION GAIN': '200-700M', '% UNPAVED': '10%'}",

    "description": "Enjoy a scenic bicycle ride on country roads, either side of Kanakapura Road, on the outskirts of Bangalore. You will hop across a dozen lakes and reservoirs that are set against a backdrop of rolling hills, on the fringes of the Bannerghatta National Park and the Ragihalli State Forest. In addition to stopping at and taking in views of these scenic water bodies, get a glimpse of the rural and semi-rural life as you pass through these villages. While cattle and their herders shuttle on dirt roads flanked by fields, orchards, and plantations, flocks of birds hang out on grasslands and backwaters. Given the undulating terrain in the region, you can expect challenges in the means of short and sweet ascents, and exhilarating descents. You can choose the easier L1 route as well.\n{'DISTANCE': '25KM', 'MIN. GROUP SIZE': '10', 'ELEVATION GAIN': '250M', '% UNPAVED': '5%'}",

    "description": "The Arkavati is an important river in Karnataka, originating at Nandi Hills, north of Bangalore in the Chikkabalapur District, and flowing down south through Ramanagara and Kanakapura. It then joins the Kaveri river further south, at Sangama. It forms several waterfalls on its journey, some small, and some large like the Chunchi falls. The region around the southern leg of this river is forested, and either adjoins or is part of one these protected areas - Nandi State Forest, Bannerghatta National Park, Basavanabetta State Forest and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. Our routes skirt around these forests and pass through the many agricultural villages nestled between forest land. The Arkavathi and its many shades of blue will be in view during several sections of the ride. This is a meticulously crafted adventure cycling tour that combines these elements perfectly - the scenic countryside route, a picnic breakfast, a buffet lunch after the ride, all the support you need during the ride, and a fun group of riders to keep you company from the incredible Pedal in Tandem community!!\n{'DISTANCE': '40-70KM', 'MIN.
