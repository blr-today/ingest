    "description": "The Arkavati is an important river in Karnataka, originating at Nandi Hills, north of Bangalore in the Chikkabalapur District, and flowing down south through Ramanagara and Kanakapura. It then joins the Kaveri river further south, at Sangama. It forms several waterfalls on its journey, some small, and some large like the Chunchi falls. The region around the southern leg of this river is forested, and either adjoins or is part of one these protected areas - Nandi State Forest, Bannerghatta National Park, Basavanabetta State Forest and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. Our routes skirt around these forests and pass through the many agricultural villages nestled between forest land. The Arkavathi and its many shades of blue will be in view during several sections of the ride. This is a meticulously crafted adventure cycling tour that combines these elements perfectly - the scenic countryside route, a picnic breakfast, a buffet lunch after the ride, all the support you need during the ride, and a fun group of riders to keep you company from the incredible Pedal in Tandem community!!\n{'DISTANCE': '40-70KM', 'MIN.

    "description": "Our route for this half-day tour weaves through the hills and lush forests around Nandi. We have curated rides of difficulty different levels in the region. The level-1 ride charts out a fairly easy route through some flat terrain while still touching upon several scenic spots. The climbs in the level-2 and level-3 route variations in this region are challenging, with some exhilarating descents. You will experience riding on quiet traffic-free forest and village roads, that run beside a couple of pristine lakes and dams. All the joys of bicycle touring wrapped into a few hours of riding.\n \n\n{'DISTANCE': '30-65KM', 'MIN. GROUP SIZE': '10', 'ELEVATION GAIN': '200-700M', '% UNPAVED': '10%'}",

    "description": "We scouted this new route on the back of our existing and very popular Nandi Countryside curation. A part of it is a hark back to the time when Nandi was but a little village with a pretty little train station in the early 1900's. Other parts are an exploration of the interior dirt tracks that run through vineyards and flower farms, and beside several lakes, most notably the one in Avati that sits beside a rocky shrub forest. We've even thrown in a short but sweet climb up a little hillock, with lovely views of the region from the top. This action-packed cycling adventure combines these elements in a way that you can appreciate them all in just a few hours on a Sunday morning. Why should cycling be reduced to the drudgery of unchanging and mindnumbing roads, set on repeat?Meeting Time: 5:45 amMeeting Point: Nandi Upachar Level-2 ride:Ride Distance: 45-50 kmCumulative Elevation Gain: 400 mLevel-3 ride:Ride Distance: 60-65 kmCumulative Elevation Gain: 500 m\n{'DISTANCE': '55-75KM', 'MIN.
