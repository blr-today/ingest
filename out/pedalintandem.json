    "description": "Join us on this cross-country ride in the Melagiri Hills, through the tranquil Aiyur forest region, in Tamil Nadu.\n Be prepared for a breathtaking day tour in some challenging terrain. Our carefully mapped-out biking routes here weave through hills, forests, farms and several water bodies. Bicycle touring can't be more fun than this!\nThe 70 km (L3) ride includes an intense climb up a hill and through a forest, but the sheer beauty of these landscapes will make you forget your tired legs. The rest of the route is mostly flat or downhill.\n You can choose the easier 40 km ride (L2) too. It is not mandatory for everyone to ride the entire distance that\u2019s planned. You could hop into the support vehicle if you wish, and still enjoy the rest of the journey in this enchanting land.\n{'DISTANCE': '40/70KM', 'ELEVATION GAIN': '500/1000M', '% UNPAVED': '5%'}",
