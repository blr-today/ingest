SUMMARY:Trees of Bengaluru:from Far and Near ~ by Science Gallery Bengaluru
DESCRIPTION:Bengaluru’s trees are a collection of both native and exotic species which lend the city its botanical diversity. The trees are part of a network of local and global transactions of human minds that work to nurture the cosmopolitan nature of this global city. These trees are part of our social\, cultural\, and emotional landscape. In this lecture\, art historian Suresh Jayaram will unpack the city’s entanglement with the aesthetic curation of trees and their role in giving the city an identity. Join us for an exploration of the trees around us! \nRegister Now

SUMMARY:City and the ideas of the Public ~ MAP\, Bengaluru
DESCRIPTION:Join this thought-provoking session with urbanist Dr. Gautam Bhan where he explores the concept of the ‘public’ and how different groups shape and experience a city’s culture and sense of belonging. This talk will investigate the dynamic relationship between public spaces and cultural identity. Dr. Bhan will examine how parks\, streets\, and communal areas serve as sites for unscripted interactions\, both similar in experience and distinct in values. He will explore how these interactions trigger dialogue\, shape a city’s culture. Essential for anyone interested in the interplay between public spaces and the diverse cultures they nurture\, this discussion will provide valuable insights into the broader urban experience. \nDr. Bhan’s discourse will shed light on critical questions such as: Who does the city belong to? Who does it leave out? How do cultural encounters trigger dialogue and shape the collective experience of a city? \nREGISTER NOW

SUMMARY:"Children Need Nature" - a national conference ~ by Karma Bhoomi Trust
DESCRIPTION:The Children need Nature conference is being offered to all by Prakriya Green Wisdom School and Bhoomi College with Karma Bhoomi Trust as the organiser. \nAbout the Conference: Many thought leaders and educationists would agree that all of us\, children as well as adults will benefit from connecting to Nature\, living a lifestyle that values Nature more. In addition\, today there is increasing scientific research as well\, that makes it clear that children need Nature for multiple reasons\, not only for their physical and mental health\, but also to improve their cognitive and creative abilities as well as their socio-emotional and personal growth. It is also becoming increasingly clear that it is essential to foster future generations who have a greater connect with Nature and a greater willingness to engage in climate action and practices for sustainability. What the world needs more than ever before are custodians and stewards of nature! It has become an imperative in times of acute climate crisis and nature disconnect. \nThe purpose of this conference is to create a space for parents\, educators and school administrators to share research findings and nature education practices and join a movement to include Nature education sessions in schools to care for the future of our children and the future of our planet. The organisers welcome you to be part of the conference! \nREGISTER NOW
