SUMMARY:Net Zero Dialogues 4th edition ~ by ATREE
DESCRIPTION:In the fourth edition of the Net Zero Dialogues\, we wish to define parameters to assess social & ecological impacts of renewable energy projects that can feed into policy. To brainstorm this approach\, ATREE\, 14 Trees Foundation\, Ecological Society Pune and Chandrakanta Kesavan Center for Energy Policy and Climate Solutions at IIT Kanpur are convening a one-day workshop at ATREE\, Bangalore on 31st August 2024. The workshop will bring together various stakeholders from the renewable energy space\, consisting of domain experts in ecology\, energy policy\, solar and wind energy industries\, government\, civil society\, other key project implementers and academicians from various institutes. \nContext \nSince the industrial revolution\, anthropogenic activities have led to an unprecedented surge in greenhouse gas emissions leading to global warming as well as pollution and depletion of natural resources. These have brought us to the brink of an environmental disaster and existential crises\, requiring us to act with urgency. Thus\, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring ecosystems are the most pressing matters for the current century\, with an eventual goal of net zero emissions (NetZero). \nHowever\, the path to NetZero is not straightforward and requires a nuanced approach involving various stakeholders. While it is a no-brainer that we need to increase our reliance on new\, clean and renewable energy technology solutions\, these must be context and locale-specific and be implemented in harmony with economic\, social and ecological perspectives.  \nAshoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE)\, Ecological Society\, 14 Trees Foundation and IIT Kanpur have together conducted brainstorming sessions to take this discussion forward. A group of climate professionals\, ecologists\, economists\, nature enthusiasts\, and technologists\, including academicians\, entrepreneurs\, freelancers\, have been convening several workshops over the past three years to discuss the road to NetZero. The takeaway from these workshops was an improved understanding of issues related to NetZero and the interdependencies to be considered in developing an actionable approach to NetZero.

SUMMARY:"Children Need Nature" - a national conference ~ by Karma Bhoomi Trust
DESCRIPTION:The Children need Nature conference is being offered to all by Prakriya Green Wisdom School and Bhoomi College with Karma Bhoomi Trust as the organiser. \nAbout the Conference: Many thought leaders and educationists would agree that all of us\, children as well as adults will benefit from connecting to Nature\, living a lifestyle that values Nature more. In addition\, today there is increasing scientific research as well\, that makes it clear that children need Nature for multiple reasons\, not only for their physical and mental health\, but also to improve their cognitive and creative abilities as well as their socio-emotional and personal growth. It is also becoming increasingly clear that it is essential to foster future generations who have a greater connect with Nature and a greater willingness to engage in climate action and practices for sustainability. What the world needs more than ever before are custodians and stewards of nature! It has become an imperative in times of acute climate crisis and nature disconnect. \nThe purpose of this conference is to create a space for parents\, educators and school administrators to share research findings and nature education practices and join a movement to include Nature education sessions in schools to care for the future of our children and the future of our planet. The organisers welcome you to be part of the conference! \nREGISTER NOW
