SUMMARY:Urban Ecology - a New Lens on Biodiversity
DESCRIPTION:Weâ€™re excited to invite you to theÂ Urban Ecology exhibition\, a collaboration with the IIHS Library and Mihir Kulkarni from the IIHS School of Environment and Sustainability.\nUnderstanding urban ecological dynamics is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate biodiversity loss and promote nature conservation within cities and for improved sustainability. However\, the process of urbanisation intertwines with social and economic factors\, creating complex interactions that demand our attention. Urban ecology addresses these challenges by studying ecology in\, of\, and for the city. Through a series of engaging activities focussed on India\, this quarterâ€™s exhibition is curated to introduce a broader audience to this fascinating area of research. \nThe curated collection of books\, publications and research articles delves into the complex interactions between cities\, nature\, and the social factors that influence them. \nThe exhibition is free and open to all; walk in and enjoy the curation.Â Donâ€™t miss the dedicated corner showcasing publications from our Small Grants Programme Projects!Â

SUMMARY:Field Ecology in India: Research execution to Science Communication
DESCRIPTION:Join this workshop on Field Ecology in India: Research execution to Science CommunicationÂ  led by Dr Nishant Kumar of Ambedkar University. \nThe concept that all humans possess an inherent biophilia positions ecologists as vital facilitators in South Asia\, where they can engage with local communities rich in traditional knowledge. These communities are not only essential stakeholders in biodiversity conservation but also play a crucial role in promoting sustainable living practices. \nThis workshop will feature sessions designed to address contemporary challenges at the intersection of conservation and development\, with a particular focus on shared well-being. Participants will engage in handson activities\, including creating videos\, posters\, graphic designs\, or comics\, dedicated to various forms of science communication. These activities aim to reflect their commitment to effective outreach. The goal is to demonstrate how leveraging expertise and fostering collaboration with local communities can enhance public understanding of ecological principles and empower individuals to take meaningful action in preserving our planetâ€™s biodiversity.

SUMMARY:Screening of 'Nilgiris - a Shared Wilderness'
DESCRIPTION:The birthplace of sacred rivers\, the land of thundering waterfalls and deep gorges\, and home to the guardians of our climate\, Indiaâ€™s first UNESCO Biosphere Reserveâ€” the Nilgirisâ€”encompasses the countryâ€™s largest network of protected areas. The Nilgiris: Indiaâ€™s Blue Mountains â€“ delves into the intersection where wildlife and humans come face to face\, shedding light on the delicate balance that has sustained this extraordinary landscape for ages. Featuring stunning 4K footage captured with advanced camera technology the film showcases the stories of remarkable wildlife â€” the elusive leopards and their playful cubs\, the gaur peacefully navigating tea plantations\, and the hornbills hunting for migratory dragonflies â€” all adapting to an ever-changing landscape. At its core\, this is a story of hope\, fragility\, and interconnected futures. As the Nilgiris continues to hold secrets within its folds\, one question remains: Can we preserve this magical yet imperfect wild habitat for future generations? \nA tale of a wilderness like no other\, where humans and wildlife live within blurred boundaries. \nSandesh V. Kadur is a BAFTA Award-winning filmmaker\, National Geographic Fellow & Explorer\, and was recently named the second-ever Explorer Trustee of the National Geographic Society Board of Trustees. His groundbreaking documentaries have aired globally on networks like National Geographic\, BBC\, Netflix\, Apple\, Discovery Channel\, and Animal Planet.
