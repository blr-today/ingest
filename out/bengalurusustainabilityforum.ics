SUMMARY:Field Ecology in India: Research execution to Science Communication
DESCRIPTION:Join this workshop on Field Ecology in India: Research execution to Science Communication  led by Dr Nishant Kumar of Ambedkar University. \nThe concept that all humans possess an inherent biophilia positions ecologists as vital facilitators in South Asia\, where they can engage with local communities rich in traditional knowledge. These communities are not only essential stakeholders in biodiversity conservation but also play a crucial role in promoting sustainable living practices. \nThis workshop will feature sessions designed to address contemporary challenges at the intersection of conservation and development\, with a particular focus on shared well-being. Participants will engage in handson activities\, including creating videos\, posters\, graphic designs\, or comics\, dedicated to various forms of science communication. These activities aim to reflect their commitment to effective outreach. The goal is to demonstrate how leveraging expertise and fostering collaboration with local communities can enhance public understanding of ecological principles and empower individuals to take meaningful action in preserving our planet’s biodiversity. \nREGISTER NOW!

SUMMARY:Screening of 'Nilgiris - a Shared Wilderness'
DESCRIPTION:We are delighted to invite you to a screening of the recent documentary “Nilgiris – A Shared Wilderness”.

Registration Link \nNilgiris: A Shared Wilderness – delves into the intersection where wildlife and humans come face to face\, shedding light on the delicate balance that has sustained this extraordinary landscape for ages.

As the Nilgiris continues to hold secrets within its folds\, one question remains: Can we preserve this magical yet imperfect wild habitat for future generations? \nREGISTER NOW to watch this tale of a wilderness like no other\, where humans and wildlife live within blurred boundaries. \nSandesh V.
