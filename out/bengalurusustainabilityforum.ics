SUMMARY:Screening of Seed Stories
DESCRIPTION:The National Centre for Biological Sciences and Bengaluru Sustainability Forum are excited to invite you to the screening of “Seed Stories\,” a compelling documentary directed by Chitrangada Choudhury. So\, mark your calendars and head over to the National Centre for Biological Sciences on Monday\, Aug 5th evening for a screening of this 42 min documentary\, that will be followed by a discussion with an experienced set of panelists involved in research and practice on different aspects of agriculture in the country. \nKindly RSVP here\nFilm Synopsis: In a village in the Niyamgiri mountains of Odisha’s Eastern Ghats\, a heroic effort is underway: barefoot ecologist Dr. Debal Deb and his 3 member-team are conserving in-situ over 1000 endangered heirloom varieties of rice. Odisha’s Eastern Ghats region is one of the world’s surviving biodiversity hotspots\, with Adivasi (Indigenous) communities like the Kondhs possessing the knowledge of growing multiple crops with their folk seeds\, evolved over centuries. At the same time\, the village and the wider region is irreversibly changing with the coming of genetically modified cotton seeds and associated chemicals. ‘Seed Stories’ takes a worm’s eye view of how this is reshaping a geography and a people steeped in agro-ecological knowledge\, and altering their attitudes towards farming\, food and ecology. It invites audiences to reflect on the question\, ‘What is sustainability?’ \n42 minutes | Odiya\, Kui\, English with English subtitles  \nPanel Discussion: Following the film screening\, we will host a panel discussion\, “Agriculture for Sustainability and Food and Nutrition Security : Challenges and Solutions”\, with an experienced set of panelists involved in research and practice on different aspects of agriculture.
