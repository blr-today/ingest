SUMMARY:Map is not the Territory ~ at Science Gallery Bengaluru
DESCRIPTION:Public Lecture followed by Ask Me Anything session  \nHow have mapping techniques evolved from ancient symbolic representations to modern Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\, and what does this evolution reveal about our understanding of spaces? Go deeper with architect Naresh Narasimhan to explore the map-territory mental model\, which differentiates between our perceptions (maps) and reality (territory). In the same way as our beliefs act like simplifications\, maps have historically been an essential principle of dividing the world around us in a systematic manner. Investigate the evolution of Bangalore through these myriad valances and the challenges of fully capturing the city’s intricate and constantly shifting landscape. \nREGISTER NOW
