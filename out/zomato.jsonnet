    "description": "Lee & Hard Rock Cafe Presents The Ultimate Tribute to AC/DC & Guns N\u2019 Roses ft. 2Blue\nYOU WILL LOVE HIM! Because he is not just a great singer! Tirthankar Poddar (aka 2Blue) is a muscular statement like a raised fist! With his four-octave militant-like voice and provocative storytelling, he is known to dazzle. Small wonder when Paul Di`Anno of Iron Maiden and George Lynch of Dokken came to India, it was 2Blue they performed with. As did Bumblefoot of Guns N\u2019 Roses.\nIf you were born in the `80s and raised on vintage rock, this could be emotional. Because chances are 2Blue is the artist you laughed and cried with when you were young. Chances are he is who you connected with on MySpace and Orkut when you needed a friend. And over the years, chances are he is who you grew old with the lead singer of Vayu who went solo, the man who was crazy enough to quit his lucrative day job to headline your college festival.",
