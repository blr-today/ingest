    "description": "Hampi, in Karnataka, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the former capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. Known for its over 500 ruins and monuments, it was once considered the second-largest city after Beijing. Situated on the Tungabhadra River, Hampi showcases ancient India's grandeur through its intricate architecture, brilliant engineering, and stunning scenery. The Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to the empire's patron deity, stands as its most significant structure.
