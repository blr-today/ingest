    "description": "German Kinoat theSuchitra Film Societythis Friday!Toni Erdmann (2016)is a German-Austrian comedy-drama film that revolves around a divorced Winfried Conradi, who after the death of his beloved dog adopts the alter ego of Toni Erdmann to reconnect with his workaholic daughter, Ines, who lives and works in Bucharest, Romania.The film is a thorny tale of a father and daughter from two different socio-political and emotional generations trying to reconnect. Described as a Dadaesque film, Winfried’s persona often leads to uncomfortable and awkward situations that sets the absurdist tone of the film and forces one to question the perplexing condition of humanity in the 21st century. In addition, the film also explores themes of professional dissatisfaction, the absurdity of corporate culture, familial relationships, personal fulfilment, and the search for authenticity in a hyper-capitalist world.Toni Erdmannby Maren Ade2016 | col.| 162 min. | German with English subtitlesMaren Adeis a German filmmaker known for her work as a writer, director, and producer.

Currently being shown are a selection ofFilms from East Germany.In order to escape her narrow and restrictive life,Senta, the daughter of a rich shipowner, seeks refuge in her fantasies and dreams. In this realm of imagination, a bold and restless sea captain,the Flying Dutchman,who is cursed to wander the seas forever appears to her. In her obsessive dreams, Senta frees this man through her love for him.Centered around the theme of\"redemption through love\",Der fliegende Holländeris a German-language opera with libretto and music byRichard Wagner,who conducted the premiere at the Königliches Hoftheater Dresden in 1843. The opera is based on the myths of a legendary phantom ship (The Flying Dutchman), allegedly never able to make port, but doomed to sail the sea forever.The Flying Dutchman | Der fliegende HolländerJoachim Herz1964 | 101 Min. | B&W | German with English subtitleswith the music ofRichard WagnerJoachim Herz(b. 1924, Dresden), one of the most influential and innovative European musical theater directors of the twentieth century. His 1977 debut at theBerlin Komische Operwas with theBrecht & Weillsatirical operaRise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, which was also recorded for East German television. His subsequent staging of The Flying Dutchman in 1962, at the invitation of Walter Felsenstein, and following productions in Leipzig (1962) and at Moscow’s Bolshoi Theater (1963) prompted an invitation to make a cinematic adaptation, the only film he ever made. Herz left the Komische Oper in 1981, possibly because of his dealings with the ensemble and GDR officials, and worked in London and Munich.After his death in 2010, the British magazineOpera Nownoted:“His Wagner productions in particular have proved ground-breaking, although his enormous contribution to revolutionary post-war changes in opera production has not always been acknowledged.”Free Entry!!",
