Our journey together will honour the profound connection between our bodies and nature\u2014embracing the seasons within us and celebrating the wisdom they bring.Event DescriptionThrough a dynamic empowerment flow led by Franzi and a deeply reflective women\u2019s circle facilitated by Sanjana, we create space for self-awareness, healing, and transformation.

Disconnect from devices for 3 hours of unplugged experience\u2014we'll have books, board games, music, crochet, and of course, food! But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. Except e-books)**Tickets are for entry and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter.",
