Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.This support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.The support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

Ya Watchin? screening you shouldn\u2019t miss, it\u2019s a horror film.\u00a0After hosting several Halloween special screenings, including a special premiere of Longlegs with PVR in Bangalore last year, she\u2019s back with a cult classic this month, Rec (Spanish).\u00a0The special evening includes the screening of this 73-minute nail-biter (with an unpredictable ending \ud83d\udc40) and will be followed by a special performance by DJ Rishi Sippy, with the perfect tunes to boogie the scares away. Expect a custom cocktail menu, pass around snacks and more. So show up in your best Halloween costume, enjoy a movie & end your Sunday evening with a dance party! Note: Gates open at 7pm and the screening will begin at 7:30pm. We request all our guests to arrive on time for us to begin the screening as planned. The dance party will start at 9:45pm post the screening and mixer.Boo! Ya Watchin?, the brainchild of Mahima. V is a Bangalore-based film screening series that turns cult classics and hidden gems into shared, immersive experiences.\u00a0\u00a0REC (2007) is a Spanish found-footage horror film directed by Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Paco Plaza. The story follows TV reporter \u00c1ngela Vidal and her cameraman as they cover a routine night shift at a fire station\u2014until a call to an apartment building turns their night into a nightmare. Shot in real-time with a claustrophobic, handheld style, REC delivers relentless tension and scares across its tight 75-minute runtime. While its intensity may not resonate with everyone, it\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most terrifying found-footage horrors ever made.Rishi Sippy is a Bangalore-based DJ and is the brain behind beloved dance IPs in the city like Jackfruit Dance Party & Freak Opera. Rishi's performances are dynamic and immersive, fluid journeys that blend hypnotic minimalism with raw, driving energy.\u00a0At Urbanaut, we're building unique and niche experiences in collaboration with our ever-present partners. Invite yourself to one \u2014 or three \u2014 or hit us up with ideas and collaborations!Ladies Who Loiter is a celebration inspired by leisure, love and art.

    "description": "Slow down for a few mindful hours with us as we explore the meditative practice of mandala art. In this guided session, you\u2019ll learn to draw your own intricate, balanced patterns \u2014 one line at a time \u2014 and experience the quiet focus that comes with this beautiful, rhythmic process.Each participant will create a set of small mandalas that can be transformed into charming bookmarks, gift tags, or luggage ties \u2014 tiny tokens of calm you can carry with you.The session will be led by Usha Murthy, who has been practicing and teaching this art form for nearly a decade. Usha has conducted Dottin Mandala workshops in the U.S., and her work beautifully bridges the ancient roots of this practice \u2014 from Australian Aboriginal dot art to the Buddhist and Indian traditions of circular mandalas symbolizing life and harmony. To get a glimpse of her work, find her on Instagram @dottinmandalas.Her teaching style is gentle, step-by-step, and highly visual \u2014 a truly sensory experience. The workshop will be conducted in English, with Hindi support if needed.No prior art experience is required \u2014 just bring your curiosity and a willingness to slow down. All materials will be provided.Join us for a peaceful morning of art, conversation, and mindfulness \u2014 right in the cozy corners of our bookstore caf\u00e9.",

No expectations, no judgment\u2014just a gentle space to reflect, share, and listen.We\u2019re excited to introduce Sober Sanctuary\u2014a regular meetup for those on the sober journey, designed to be more intimate and intentional. While we\u2019re committed to curating larger sober events that are lively and fun, Sober Sanctuary offers something different: a quieter space to connect with like-minded people, build community, and explore what life beyond alcohol can look like.Each session invites you to slow down, share experiences, and spend time in quiet reflection, while also exploring the small shifts in daily habits that can spark lasting change. You\u2019ll be joined by Sarah, a certified habits and lifestyle coach, who will help guide the flow and hold space for meaningful conversations.*This isn\u2019t a formal or structured rehab program, but rather a welcoming circle where you can listen, reflect, and grow alongside others. Whether you\u2019re sober, sober curious, or simply looking for deeper, more intentional connections, you\u2019ll find a supportive home here.",

From the bustling IT hubs of modernIndia to the quiet cotton fields of the seventeenth-century Deccan, Lakshmi crafts tales thatexplore the fragile boundaries between the ordinary and the extraordinary, the real and thesupernatural. Each story opens a window into a different world \u2014 one filled with love, loss, guilt,and grace.Populated with a memorable cast \u2014 from a spirited old lady to a weary housewife and arestless teenager \u2014 this collection delves into the raw, unguarded emotions that make ushuman. Told with insight, warmth, and gentle humour, Bebey\u2019s Day Out is a celebration of life\u2019sunpredictability, reminding us that beneath every moment of chaos or calm lies a story waiting tobe told.About the authorLakshmi C.V. is a writer who delightfully blurs the lines between being a storyteller and ahomemaker \u2014 though she\u2019s still deciding which came first. A Physics graduate from IIT with herhead often in the clouds but her feet firmly on the ground (also the name of her blog), Lakshmibrings warmth, humour, and heart to everything she writes. Her journey as a writer began early,with her first piece published in Eve\u2019s Weekly while she was still in school.Her stories have since appeared in Femina, Woman\u2019s Era, Good Housekeeping, Today,Women\u2019s Web, and Readomania, among others. She has also written books for children andcontributed to anthologies like Airavata: Elephant Tales. When not lost in words, Lakshmi can befound teaching, volunteering, or reading \u2014 always finding joy in the journey rather than thedestination.She slips in and out of teaching mode without warning. It was quite a relief to her children whenshe took up assignments as a volunteer with Teach India.When she is not writing, she is reading for herself, and editing other people\u2019s works.For her, the journey is more interesting than the destination.She lives in the NCR.",

Over time, these evolved into the fruit-laden Christmas cakes we know and love today \u2014 dense with soaked fruits, spices, and warmth. Every bite tells a story of tradition, family, and festive indulgence.The Significance of Fruit MixingFruit mixing marks the beginning of the Christmas baking season. It\u2019s a joyful ritual where dry fruits, nuts, and peels are blended with aromatic spices and generous splashes of spirits or wine \u2014 then left to mature and soak in all that festive goodness. The longer the mix rests, the richer the flavor \u2014 just like how good things in life deepen with time.At Studio M, this ceremony is more than just preparation \u2014 it\u2019s our way of ushering in the spirit of togetherness. It\u2019s laughter shared over sticky spoons, the sparkle of wine poured into jars, and the joyful anticipation of cakes that will soon fill our ovens (and hearts) with warmth.A Toast to Christmas TraditionsFrom lighting candles to caroling, gifting, and baking, every Christmas ritual reminds us to slow down and celebrate the beauty of giving. Our fruit mixing day carries that same essence \u2014 a sweet start to a season filled with gratitude, love, and community.So come join us as we stir, laugh, and soak \u2014 and raise a toast to the season of joy!",

    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where lectures meet drinks in a relaxed pub-style setting.Did you know some moths can disguise themselves as leaves or bark to avoid predators? They navigate by moonlight, often confused by our streetlights, and males can detect a female\u2019s scent from over ten kilometers away. Moths are also vital night-time pollinators\u2014and some, like the Luna Moth, don\u2019t eat at all, living just long enough to find love before fading away.For our 10th lecture, we\u2019re thrilled to host Dr. Pritha Dey, Moth Biologist and Evolutionary Ecologist, and Head of Natural History Collections at NCBS Bangalore.In \u201cMuch Ado About \u2018Moth\u2019ing\u201d, Dr. Dey shines a light on one of nature\u2019s most overlooked wonders \u2014 moths. Often dismissed as mere \u201cnight butterflies,\u201d moths are among the most diverse and ecologically vital insect groups. Through stories from her fieldwork in the Western Himalayas and Western Ghats, Dr. Dey will reveal their hidden beauty, crucial ecological roles, and how you can start spotting and identifying them right from your own backyard.From setting up simple light traps to photographing and recording species, this session will help you discover the rich nocturnal biodiversity just outside your door and maybe even change the way you look at porch lights forever.All this, over a complimentary Geist beer or mocktail at the charming Jamming Goat 3.0 in Indiranagar.What to Expect:\ud83e\udd8b A 45-minute session blending science, stories, and hands-on moth-watching insights\ud83e\udde0 15\u201320 minutes of Q&A to ask your questions and share your own nature observations\ud83c\udf79 A 30-minute mixer to chat, connect, and exchange stories with fellow attendees\ud83c\udf7a One complimentary beer or mocktail included with your ticket\ud83c\udf55 \u00c0 la carte food menu available throughout the evening\u2728 Science, stories, and conversations that might just light up your nightEvent Details:\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, 26th October | 4:00 PM \u2013 6:00 PM\ud83d\udccd Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar, Bangalore\ud83c\udfab Limited to 90 attendees only\ud83d\udcb0 Early bird pricing available for first 10 ticketsAbout the Lecturer:Dr. Pritha Dey is the Head of Natural History Collections at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore.

    "description": "An Evening of Survivor & Protest Poetry, Feminism, and HealingUnder the Jackfruit Tree is not just a book \u2014 it is a reclamation. An evening that bridges poetry and protest, music and memory, trauma and tenderness. Join Nish, poet and author of Under the Jackfruit Tree, for a one-hour immersive experience that intertwines survivor poetry, trauma stories, feminist reflections from the 90s, and a heartfelt journey of inner child healing.This evening celebrates the voices that survived, the children who grew up too soon, and the communities that continue to rebuild themselves with love, dissent, and resilience.Expect raw spoken word because healing, after all, is incomplete without unconditional love.About the BookUnder the Jackfruit Tree: A Tribute to the Inner Child and a Chorale of Hopeis an unflinching collection of poems that unearth the layered histories of trauma, inheritance, and healing.Nish writes with a voice that is both political and personal \u2014 a lyrical rebellion that meditates on the legacies of survival, feminism, and compassion.Through six acts of poetry, the book journeys from childhood rupture to adult repair, culminating in an anthem of hope and defiance \u2014 a manifesto for those who have ever longed for gentleness in a brutal world.About the AuthorNish is a Survivor and proud Thriver, a poet and community builder devoted to trauma healing, inner child work, and feminist storytelling.She is also a tech product leader by profession, living in Bengaluru with her partner of 15 years and two beloved Indies.Writing under her poetic identity Gargle in Grey, Nish believes in the power of a conscious community and the refusal of binaries \u2014 in life, love, and art.This launch isn\u2019t merely a literary event \u2014 it\u2019s a\u00a0social movement through verse.Each reading becomes a protest, each poem a reclamation of language and tenderness from the jaws of trauma.\u201cThrough my poems,\u201d Nish says, \u201cI speak to the ones who have survived in silence. This book is an ode to them \u2014 and to the children we once were, who kept us alive.\u201d",
