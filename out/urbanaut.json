Different backgrounds, different stories, one shared meal. The crowd is balanced, open minded, and there by choice, not chance. No loud networking. No awkward icebreakers. Just good food, unforced conversations, and the kind of listening that rarely happens in daily life.The restaurants are carefully chosen. Comfortable, well loved spaces where you can settle in and talk without rushing. The focus is not on the menu alone, but on the atmosphere that allows connection to unfold naturally.Some nights are light and playful. Some go deeper than expected. Some surprise you quietly. That is the point.StepOut Dinners are not about dating or outcomes. They are about discovery. Showing up. Sitting down. Letting the table do its quiet work.Sometimes, all it takes is one seat at the right table for life to feel a little more open. For more information, visit www.stepout.world",

    "description": "About the play:The Prophet and the Poet is based on the exchange of letters and articles between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore over 25 years, with the Indian freedom struggle as the backdrop. The letters reveal how the two personalities differed significantly on the form and content of the freedom movement. The differences widened over the years. However, the depth of their personalities maintained genuine respect for each other in spite of deep differences on ideological grounds. It reflected the political maturity of those times in India. Bangalore Little Theatre was privileged to be invited to stage the opening shows of the play at the places hallowed by Gandhi and Tagore in their lifetime \u2013 Sabarmati Ashram, Santiniketan (Visva Bharati) and Jorasanko in Kolkata. The Kolkata performance was at the courtyard stage of Thakurbadi, the Tagore ancestral home, now a heritage site looked after by Rabindra Bharati University. On the occasion of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s birth anniversary, the play was staged at the Raj Bhavan, Bangalore, with the President of India in attendance. Later, the play was performed by invitation in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh, as part of the India-Bangladesh Joint Celebrations of Tagore\u2019s 150th birth anniversary. Prasar Bharati commissioned a tele-film of the play. The film was telecast several times over Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti. There have been about 130 performances of the play since its opening. The play has generated much interestoutside India as well. It has had two American productions, one in Houston and the other at the University of Iowa. Productions in UK and Ireland are also planned. A highly successful tour of Trinidad & Tobago was followed by performances in Singapore, co-hosted by Tagore Society and the Indian High Commission. The play was invited to Sydney for celebrations of Gandhi\u2019s 150th birth anniversary. An enriching experience ... Times of India, KolkataEnthralled ...

They are a result of cultural norms and conversations that were not designed around women navigating motherhood.This facilitated, small-group circle is for mothers who want to reconnect with their desire, confidence, and connection without forcing it. We will talk about intimacy shifts like fatigue, body image, guilt, mental load, and explore practical ways of addressing them. The Pleasure Circle is rooted in honest conversation, guided reflection, and simple tools that support reconnection over pressure.About the facilitator:Nishtha is a marketer, trained dancer and somatic movement practitioner who focuses on intimacy and the pleasure gap women face. Over the past five years, she\u2019s created spaces for women to explore desire, body image, and guilt in the US, UK and now, back home here in Bengaluru. Having grown up in India amid sexual taboos, she\u2019s passionate about helping women reconnect with pleasure through honest conversation and embodied, guided practices.",

This performance begins right there, challenging the idea of limiting celebration to a date on the calendar.Instead, we open a space for real stories.Stories of being a woman.Stories of loving, learning from, and living alongside women.Stories of mothers, teachers, mothers-in-law, partners, sisters, daughters, friends, bosses, colleagues, daughters-in-law\u2014and everything in between.Stories of how men see the women in their lives.Stories of embracing the feminine within.What to ExpectThis unique Playback Theatre experience invites the audience to share personal moments and lived experiences. In real time, our performers will transform these stories into spontaneous theatre using movement, music, and dialogue\u2014honest, unscripted, and deeply human.Threads and Tales is an Applied theater initiative by Lahe Lahe Caravan \u23f1\ufe0fWhen: 8th March | 5:30 \u2013 7:00 PM\ud83d\udccd Where: Atta Galata, Indiranagar\ud83c\udf9f Tickets: 300 rs per person",

    "description": "We scroll past everything.A war.A wedding reel.A protest.A discount code.Smoke over a city.A poem we almost read.And somewhere between all of it, our heart doesn\u2019t get enough time to feel.Zara Sa Yaad Rakhna Hai is an evening of ghazals that refuses to hurry.Seven stories, seven moments we choose not to swipe past.From Ghalib\u2019s unanswered wounds in Ibn-e-Mariamto Mir\u2019s lingering question - Yeh dhuan kahan se uthta hai?from Faiz\u2019s dignified defiance in Aaj Bazaar Meinto a deeply personal new composition being released that evening!this is not just a mehfil.It is a pause.With tabla, harmonium, electric guitar and voice, we sit with stories of loss, desire, forgiveness, protest, memory  and allow music to stretch time.In a world that rewards speed, come choose stillness.Scroll. Stop. Stay.",

Rossini\u2019s operatic brilliance shines through Rossiniana, while contemporary works like Benga Beat and Shamal bring modern rhythm and atmosphere to the programme.Together, these works reveal the versatility of the guitar, exploring traditional themes that expand into new sonic worlds.For more details about the artist please visit: sidharthsarangi.in",

Set in 1920s Moscow, it tells the satirical and darkly humorous story of a stray dog named Sharik, who is transformed into a human by Professor Preobrazhensky through a daring medical experiment. The resulting man, Poligraf Poligrafovich Sharikov, embodies the social and ideological tensions of early Soviet society. With its sharp critique of class struggle, human nature, and the perils of radical change, the film is celebrated for its faithful adaptation, brilliant performances, and rich allegorical depth.",

    "description": "If you are reading this, it is possible that you, like me, benefit in visible and invisible ways from the extractive economies of our time. This is not to blame and shame, for we are living within systems that were set up before us, shaped by forces larger than any one of us. Within such systems, it can feel easier to narrow our field of vision and focus on what seems within our control: our work, our families, our health, our immediate responsibilities.We were born into a world organized around winners and losers. When the scale of suffering far exceeds the scale of our agency, forging ahead on our own path can feel like the only viable option, instead of feeling weighed down by those who are losing. Numbness to inequality (particularly income inequality) can even present itself as clarity and pragmatism.All this, again, is not to shame the urge to look away; but to notice for ourselves when and where we might feel like we have agency rather than feeling numb when we encounter the kinds of deeply entrenched socio economic inequality we see around us.There are spaces for solutioning, but this is not one of them, for income inequality is not a problem that stands alone. It is a by-product of the extractive, complex systems we live in.Can we first stay present to the harms we are entangled in without going numb?This gathering is an invitation to explore that question together.",

The poet will be in conversation with Vinutha Mallya.Ode to Broken Things is a reflection on what it means to be human, to be a living repository of timestamps of our individual and collective struggles and celebrations and of rebellions and failures. These poems are a quiet observation of our responses to the passing of these events and of our efforts to understand this world that offers experiences of duality \u2014 of wars and peacetime, abundance and poverty, of love and hate. Ode to Broken Things is also a prayer and an earnest dream for a peaceful world for everyone, where all hearts are warm and borders are always open.In Ode to Broken Things, we are taken to the heart of matter \u2014 to observe the atomic, the molecular, the granular parts of our inner and outer worlds that we miss amid the unsettling busyness. Ode to Broken Things invites us to feel, see, think and wonder about all that surrounds us.

Some stories are waiting to be seen.There are struggles that did not begin with you.They move quietly through family lines, shaping emotions, relationships, fears, and choices in ways that are often invisible.Family Constellation is a gentle yet profound group process that brings hidden family dynamics into awareness. When what was unseen becomes visible, something begins to settle. Not by force. Not by analysis. But through recognition.This is not talk therapy. This is experiential.In a respectful, grounded circle, we explore the deeper layers beneath repeating patterns, unexplained heaviness, relational blocks, guilt, grief, anxiety, or feeling \u201cstuck\u201d despite doing inner work.Many participants share that what shifts is subtle yet unmistakable:A calmer nervous systemA sense of clarity that was missingEmotional release without reliving traumaA quiet understanding of \u201cthis makes sense now\u201d Even those who attend as representatives or observers often experience personal insight and movement within their own lives.You may feel called to attend if you: Keep repeating similar relationship or emotional patterns.Carry guilt, fear, or heaviness without a clear reason.Feel blocked despite personal growth efforts.Sense that something older than you is asking to be acknowledged.\ufeffWhat to Expect: A safe, confidential group setting Guided facilitation with care and structureDeep yet gentle explorationNo prior knowledge or preparation requiredYou do not need to understand the process for it to workSometimes presence is enough.Link for pre-session questionaire for client ",

After years in the corporate world as a CA, I made an intentional shift, from spreadsheets to sound bowls, from deadlines to deep presence. Life gave me the courage to tune into my inner wisdom, and that led me here- to the path of healing, mindfulness, and holding space for othersToday, I blend sound healing, mindfulness, and psychology to help people feel more grounded, present, and connected to themselves. My work is heart-led, real, and rooted in everything I have experienced & learnt along the way.",

    "description": "Women have a complicated relationship with money.And it starts early.Many families shield their daughters from anything related to \u2018finance\u2019. This well meaning protection ends up being a disservice. For when these young women step into the real world, they lack the confidence to make financial decisions - not because they\u2019re incapable, but because they were never given information on budgeting, savings and investments.Later in life, many continue to rely on their partners for investment decisions. This dependency on others will only stop when they have the right information and toolkit to take back control.That\u2019s is where we come in.Our upcoming session is a safe, private space - where no question is too small or too basic.We\u2019ll be focusing on one core idea:Building financial security for women through investing.The session at Bangalore will be led by two amazing experts who truly get it and will help you understanding investing better.Satya Sontaman -Chartered Accountant, Zerodha VarsityHansi Mehrotra - Chartered Financial Analyst and Founder The Money HansKey topics we\u2019ll cover:Philosophy of MoneyActionable Money FrameworkUnderstanding the Money HouseFinancial Planning & Goal SettingAsset AllocationInvestment Products (Fixed Income, Equities, Mutual Funds)Active vs Passive InvestingInvestment Strategies & DiversificationCommunity ResourcesPLUSA session on how to work with AI - this is a session for beginners who want to create products (like money trackers etc) without code.(As women, we need to address the elephant in the room - AI, or we're going to be left behind. People who understand and learn to work with AI will be more employable in the future. Once you buy your ticket, you also have the option of sending in your question in advance, the speakers address all these questions through the session - so send them in :)",

It is used as a mood and ambience enhancer with its melodic interventions, and as a supporting instrument for the performers and chorus in its present context.\u00a0Abhinaya and Sasikumar have been exploring different genres of melody and movement, to see the diverse ways in which the body can meet the sound, and all the different spaces (physically and aurally) the mukavinai and the body can occupy together.The first phase of this project was supported by the Department of Performing Arts at Ashoka, and was developed over a short period of time at Kattaikkuttu Sangam in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu.Tickets Mandatory for all.*",

    "description": "Join us for an open-air screening of Beetlejuice (1988). This delightfully strange, darkly comic cult classic celebrates the wonderfully eccentric brilliance of Catherine O\u2019Hara, paired with a cosy three-course dinner by Chef Rhea Aaron and fresh popcorn under the stars.*Wines and other beverages will be available for purchase at the venue.*About the movie:Directed by Tim Burton, Beetlejuice follows the recently deceased Maitlands as they attempt to haunt the new inhabitants of their home, only to accidentally unleash a chaotic, mischievous bio-exorcist who turns their afterlife upside down.At its heart, the film is a playful ode to individuality, theatricality, and the joy of embracing the bizarre, brought to life most memorably through Catherine O\u2019Hara\u2019s iconic, eccentric portrayal of Delia Deetz. Equal parts outrageous and endearing, her performance adds a layer of stylish absurdity that makes the film endlessly rewatchable. Whimsical, visually striking, and unapologetically offbeat, it\u2019s a perfect evening for those who love cult cinema, character-driven brilliance, and a little gothic humour.Paired with a thoughtfully prepared three-course dinner by Chef Rhea Aaron and wines from Wine in Progress, it\u2019s an easy, feel-good way to spend a night outdoors, immersed in film, flavour, and a touch of eccentric magic.Terms and ConditionsThe management is not responsible for any injury or damage that may occur during the event.No liability or claims arising from the consumption or intake of any food or drink will be entertained by the management.Parking near the event premises is at the risk of the vehicle owner.Limited Valet service is available at a charge of Rs. 200 per vehicle.Photographs and videos of ticket holders may be uploaded to social media.
