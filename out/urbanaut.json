    "description": "Discover the history of the Bengaluru fort on this walk. The Fort though today reduced to a mere fraction of its original expanse\u2014less than 5%\u2014remains one of the most significant remnants of the city\u2019s pre-colonial past. This heritage walk invites you to step into the vestiges of a fort that once bore witness to battles transitions of power architectural ingenuity and political resilience.The fort began as a modest mud structure before being fortified with stone during Hyder Ali\u2019s rule and later expanded under his son Tipu Sultan. These walls though weathered by time preserve within them the layered narratives of a growing urban center and the complexities of South Indian resistance to British expansion.A highlight of the walk is the iconic Tipu Sultan\u2019s Summer Palace a rare example of Indo-Islamic architecture with its intricate wooden pillars frescoes and elegant symmetry. Once the seat of royal administration and leisure the palace offers insights not only into architectural aesthetics but also into the socio-political life of the Sultanate in the 18th century.As we navigate the narrow lanes of Old Bengaluru one encounters a little-known but historically important site: a surviving armoury tucked into the urban sprawl and forgotten by modern maps. Used during Tipu\u2019s reign this structure is a physical testament to the city\u2019s martial past and the strategic importance of Bangalore in Mysore\u2019s military planning.A focal point of this walk is the Battle of Bangalore (1791) a critical campaign during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. The battle pitted the British East India Company against Tipu Sultan\u2019s forces and highlighted not only the military prowess of the Sultanate but also broader geopolitical shifts\u2014especially the fallout of British actions in other global theatres such as in the American Revolutionary War.It is particularly notable that the Mysorean rockets used innovatively during this time caught the attention of British military observers. Some of these designs later found their way into documentation that would influence the development of European\u2014and even American\u2014military technology. Legend holds that they partly inspired Francis Scott Key\u2019s reference to \"the rockets' red glare\" in the Star-Spangled Banner.Finally the walk concludes with a return to the present\u2014by way of South Indian culinary tradition offering participants a curated local snack and a cup of filter coffee. A reminder that history does not only reside in books or ruins\u2014it lives on in tastes traditions and memories.This walking tour is not just about stones and structures. It is a curated window into Bengaluru\u2019s transformation\u2014from fortified stronghold and seat of regional power to colonial outpost and finally to modern metropolis. In walking its paths we do not merely observe history; we retrace it.Note : \"This walk is led by a Bengaluru native and professional architect who has lived and studied in the vicinity of the fort for over three decades. His deep-rooted connection to the area combined with his architectural expertise gives him an intimate knowledge of not just every corner of the fort but also the rich history that surrounds it.\"",

    "description": "This is an immersive learning space for people who want to practice Shibari but haven't found the right space, people or facilitator in India to learn from.The goal of these six week courses is to facilitate regular, structured Shibari practice that aims to go deep rather than broad, helping you to develop a really firm grasp of rope bondage fundamentals, build muscle memory, and get to know other participants. The classes will be conducted every Saturday afternoon and will be led by Amiya, Founder of Silly Hands Shibari.The 6-week cohort is limited to a select group of registered participants only. No walk-ins.Each ticket gives you entry for 2 People i.e you + your rope partner. What is Shibari?Shibari is a contemporary form of rope bondage that was originated in Japan in the early 1200-1800's. Later popularized in the 21st century as a pleasure-craft. Shibari, despite its various styles, adheres to a certain aesthetic and exclusively uses ropes as a primary tool to build trust and connect with oneself and others.What to expect?3 hour weekly in-person hands-on lessons100% Vetted ParticipantsJapanese Asanawa (Hemp ropes) for the classFree access to Rope Jams1:1 Technical & Safety guidance throughout the programPost-course integration supportLimited Edition SHS MerchThis is a structured learning space that explores mind\u2013body engagement through rope. The course supports flexibility in awareness, communication, and embodied practice, using rope as a practical and intentional tool. Safety, consent, and consistency remain central to the learning process.We will cover the fundamental knots, frictions, patterns, harnesses, and introduces participants to important skills such as rope handling and tensioning. By the end of the course, participants should understand how to construct a short rope scene that brings together technical and playful elements.Further InformationDates: Every Saturday starting 24th January, 2 pm - 5 pm.Where: The Bangalore Local, Koramangala, Bengaluru.Who can Join :Adults 21+ with no prior experience but plenty interest, LGBTQIA+ solo or with a rope partner.The ticket gives you entry for 2 People i.e you + your rope partner.Participants who sign up solo are encouraged to partner up with another solo-participant to practice the ties on each other. If you don\u2019t want to switch (both tie and be tied), then we would recommend coming with a partner.About the Facilitator: Amiya Bhanushali (she/they) is a queer multidisciplinary artist, contemporary curator and creative strategist. Her work explores art, human connection and design across all disciplines, with a focus on Indian and South Asian narratives. They began to explore Shibari in 2022 as an extension of their art and research into kink-based practices. As their style naturally progressed beyond aesthetics alone, they began to discover interconnections between queerness, pleasure, trauma and neurodivergence.Questions?

    "description": "About Aquaphonica:Acquaphonica is a contemporary jazz project led by Italian pianist and composer Federica Colangelo, conceived as a long-term creative laboratory where composition, improvisation, and cross-cultural rhythmic research converge.The trio explores a personal musical language shaped by contemporary jazz, 20th-century Western music, and South Indian Carnatic rhythmic traditions, with a strong focus on form, texture, and collective interaction.The current project, Forward, expands the trio format through the special participation of Carnatic percussion master B.C. Manjunath, deepening the rhythmic dimension and opening new perspectives on groove, time, and improvisation.About the artists:FEDERICA COLANGELO: piano, compositionFederica Colangelo is an Italian pianist and composer born in Rome. After studying classical piano at the Royal School of London, she moved to the Netherlands in her early twenties, where she continued her studies in jazz piano and later in contemporary composition.During her years in the Netherlands, she founded Acquaphonica, a project conceived from the outset as a creative laboratory for her original music. With Acquaphonica she has released three albums of original compositions: Private Enemy (2012), Chiaroscuro (2016), and Endless Tail (2019). The fourth album, Forward, is forthcoming and will be presented in October 2025.Her work is characterized by continuous exploration and experimentation, drawing from jazz improvisation and compositional practices, 20th-century European and American music (including influences such as Charles Ives, Philip Glass, John Cage, and Igor Stravinsky), and the rich rhythmic traditions of South Indian Carnatic music. These elements form the basis of her distinctive compositional voice.Alongside Acquaphonica, Colangelo writes and arranges music for various ensembles. Notable works include Undecided (2010) for a 14-piece orchestra, composed during a close collaboration with Dutch composer Otto Ketting and later performed and recorded by the HKU Conservatory Youth Orchestra. In 2014 she arranged six traditional Bulgarian songs for string quintet, presented at the Apollonia Art Festival (Bulgaria). In 2016 she arranged her composition Graphic Work (from the album Chiaroscuro, Alfa Music) for the Civica Big Band, performed at Teatro Piccolo di Milano within the \u201cNew Generations\u201d series.In May 2024 she launched Advaita Crescendo, an international quintet formed in Amsterdam, bringing together Indian and Western musicians: veena virtuoso Dr. Suma Sudhindra, flutist and composer Ned McGowan, percussionist Karthik Mani, bassist Laurent Peckels, and Federica Colangelo on piano. The project blends European composition with Carnatic melodic, rhythmic, and improvisational concepts in the search for a shared musical language.She is also active in the duo Timelines with vocalist Giulia Cianca, currently working on an album inspired by the life and writings of Joyce Lussu.Since 2021, Federica Colangelo has been teaching Jazz Composition at the Conservatories of Campobasso and Udine.Throughout her career she has collaborated with numerous internationally active musicians and performed at festivals and venues across Europe and India.IGOR LEGARI \u2013 double bassIgor Legari is an Italian double bassist, improviser, and educator based in Rome since 2011, where he is an active presence in the jazz and improvised music scene.His trio ARBO, with Marco Colonna and Ermanno Baron, released its debut album in 2022 on Folderol Records, receiving widespread critical acclaim, including being cited among the best Italian jazz albums of the year. In March 2024 he recorded Something About It, the debut album of Fabrizio Sferra\u2019s new quartet featuring Francesco Bearzatti and Giovanni Guidi, to be released by Parco della Musica Records.Legari is a member of Ettore Fioravanti\u2019s Opus Magnum, with which he has released two albums (Opus Magnum, AlfaMusic 2019; Attraverso ogni confine, Parco della Musica Records 2022). He is also part of pianist Francesco Negro\u2019s trio, with whom he has recorded three albums between 2011 and 2022.He collaborates extensively with composer Teho Teardo, both for film and fashion soundtracks and for live multimedia productions. Together with Susanna Buffa, he created the project Quando l\u2019Anarchia Verr\u00e0, dedicated to libertarian songs of the 19th and 20th centuries, published in December 2024 by Kurumuny.A founding member of the trio LUZ, he has toured extensively across Europe and recorded two albums for Auand Records. He has also been a key figure in the Roman improvisation collective Franco Ferguson.Legari holds a diploma in Jazz Double Bass from the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome and a degree in Sociology. He has taught Jazz Ensemble at the Conservatorio \u201cF. Morlacchi\u201d of Perugia.GIOVANNI NARDIELLO \u2013 drumsBorn in 1995, Giovanni Nardiello began his musical journey at a young age, influenced by his father. He started his professional career at 16, performing in projects ranging from indie rock to pop, experiences that led him to open concerts for major Italian artists such as Marlene Kuntz, Thegiornalisti, and members of Afterhours.In parallel, he began studying jazz in 2015, focusing on improvisation and contemporary languages. He studied with leading figures of the international jazz scene, including Gregory Hutchinson, Ziv Ravitz, Jim Black, Stefano Battaglia, and Ralph Alessi.In 2021 he moved to Tallinn, where he studied Contemporary Improvisation at the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre and took part in masterclasses with artists such as Marc Ribot and Le Quan Ninh.He has been involved in several award-winning projects, including the Alessandro Pennino Trio, which won the Val d\u2019Agri Jazz Festival and recorded the album Memento (2019, WoW Records). His project Perspectives was a finalist at the Premio Isio Saba 2023.In 2022 he released Kairi with the trio Triologic, featuring guest trumpeter Ralph Alessi. Currently based in Siena, he is working on his first album as a leader while collaborating with numerous contemporary jazz and experimental ensembles.SPECIAL GUESTB.C. MANJUNATH \u2013 Carnatic percussionB.C. Manjunath is one of the leading exponents of South Indian Carnatic percussion of his generation. Trained within the traditional Carnatic system, he is internationally recognized for his mastery of mridangam and konnakol, as well as for his ability to engage in cross-cultural musical contexts.Active both in India and internationally, he has collaborated with leading figures of Indian classical music and with musicians from the jazz and contemporary music worlds. His work is distinguished by a deep rhythmic sophistication, precision, and a strong sense of musical dialogue.Within Acquaphonica \u2013 Forward, Manjunath\u2019s participation expands the trio\u2019s rhythmic framework, introducing Carnatic rhythmic concepts into an open improvisational context. His presence plays a central role in redefining time, groove, and interaction, contributing decisively to the project\u2019s sonic identity.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

He will talk about selected stories and engage informally with the audience. Signed copies of the book will be on sale.The following are sample extracts from reviews on Amazon globally and on Goodreads:\u2022 India: \u201cINDISHMAN reminded me of the lyrical beauty of Arundhati Roy, the vivid storytelling of Salman Rushdie, and the magic of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\u201d\u2022 UK: \u201cA lovely meander through the vagaries of human nature. Each story warms the heart like a good malt whisky. A very well-written book; I defy anyone not to enjoy it.\u201d\u2022 USA: \u201cIt (INDISHMAN) is hard to slot into a specific genre \u2013 the stories, reflections and gentle musings flit from rural Kerala to Nepal, from Southampton to the high seas with ease. They strike the perfect balance between being sharply observed and deeply memorable, yet light enough for an effortlessly enjoyable read, and never without a touch of humour and heart.

Together, these elements create a space where words are not merely heard, but felt \u2014 allowing the audience to touch closure, clarity, and a softer, steadier kind of inner peace.Shaam-e-Baazgasht | Bengaluru Diaries offers an evening of listening, pausing, and returning \u2014 to oneself.

His work appears in numerous print and online platforms. This is his second book of poems.Babitha Marina Justin is a writer and visual artist who moves easily between a paintbrush and a pen. Her poetry lingers on memory, gender, and the small intimacies of everyday life, with a voice that can be tender one moment and uncompromising the next. She has written nine books, including three poetry collections, Of Fireflies, Guns and the Hills (2015), I Cook My Own Feast (2019), and Forty-Five Shades of Brown (2023). She also co-edited salt, pepper and silver linings: celebrating our grandmothers (2019), a tribute to resilience and inheritance.Salini Vineeth is a fiction writer and translator.

Inspired by the philosophy of John Muir Laws\u2014observation, curiosity, and wonder\u2014this session invites participants to look closely at everyday nature: backyard birds, leaves, flowers, insects, sounds, and fleeting moments that often go unnoticed.You don\u2019t need to be an artist or a writer. Nature journaling is not about perfection\u2014it\u2019s about paying attention. Through simple prompts, guided observation, and easy watercolor and drawing exercises, you\u2019ll learn how to record what you see, feel, and wonder about in your own sketchbook.This workshop is perfect if you want to:Slow down and be present in the momentBuild a regular nature journaling habitExplore watercolor and sketching in a relaxed, pressure-free wayReconnect with your curiosity and childlike sense of wonderUse art as a calming, mindful practiceBy the end of the session, you\u2019ll walk away with:A completed nature journal pageSimple tools and prompts you can reuse at homeIncreased confidence in observing and expressing natureA calmer, more grounded state of mindAll materials will be provided.About the FacilitatorThe workshop is facilitated by Charu Jain, a self-taught watercolor artist and illustrator with a deep love for storytelling and nature journaling.Charu\u2019s work is rooted in gentle observation, expressive lines, and a playful, hand-drawn watercolor style. She believes art is a way to slow down, listen deeply, and build a personal relationship with the natural world. Her practice combines illustration, journalling, and storytelling to make creativity feel accessible rather than intimidating.Through her workshops, Charu encourages participants to let go of \u201cgetting it right\u201d and instead focus on noticing, wondering, and enjoying the process. Her sessions are known for being warm, inclusive, and thoughtfully guided\u2014especially welcoming to beginners.",

Grounded in her belief that healthy plant-based food needs to be both satisfying and full of flavour to be sustainable, this workshop focuses on creating the kind of salad people genuinely enjoy eating.The fermentation session, led by Chef Titiksa, offers a gentle introduction to the basics of fermentation, including how it differs from pickling and a simple understanding of lacto-fermentation, before moving into hands-on making. Each participant will create their own ferment by choosing from seasonal vegetables, spices, and herbs, and learning how to bring it together in a jar to take home and continue fermenting in their own time.In between, we will gather for a shared lunch, a thoughtfully prepared spread that brings these ideas to life. Expect salads, a toastie, a drink, and dessert, each drawing on the techniques, flavours, and elements explored through salad-making and fermentation.",

Just a short ride from the metro, the space feels like a pause from the city, where you can slow down, breathe a little, and spend time outdoors.The experience begins with a guided walk through the farm, where you will see what is growing during winter and learn about seasonal vegetables from Karnataka. We will talk about what grows in this season, why it grows, and how different regions traditionally cook with these ingredients.After the walk, you will sit down between the fields for a relaxed conversation about winter produce, followed by a watercolour painting session by Sangeetha Alwar from Mysore. Surrounded by pumpkins, greens, and roots, you will paint winter vegetables as still life. No prior art experience needed. This is about observing, experimenting, and enjoying the process.In the afternoon, a seated five course meal will be served on the farm by Ole Project. Each course highlights winter vegetables in comforting and creative ways, with small stories from Kannadiga kitchens shared along the way.Before you head back, you will get to harvest fresh greens from the farm yourself and take them home. This is not a rushed event. It is meant to be slow, grounding, and joyful.",

    "description": "Women, War & Peace: From spoils of war to boring budgets: where pirates and finance ministers meetWhat does a government budget have to do with war and peace?Often more than treaties, speeches, or even guns.When wars end, the real struggle begins quietly\u2014on spreadsheets, in tax codes, and inside ministries that decide who gets paid, who gets protected, and who gets left out. This Pint of View lecture puts public finance and gender at the centre of peacebuilding, showing how seemingly mundane economic decisions shape post-war societies.Drawing on case studies from across four continents, the talk follows the transition from war economies to peace economies. Choices around taxation, welfare, employment, and public spending can stabilise fragile states or reopen the conditions for conflict.Along the way, we meet women rarely associated with economics or public finance: pirates, soldiers, military generals, refugee activists, negotiators with warlords, and finance ministers. These are the people who step in after the fighting ends and shape what peace looks like in practice.SpeakerDr. Kade Finnoff is Associate Professor of Economics at Azim Premji University and a development economist whose work focuses on countries emerging from violent conflict. She has spent several years working on inequality and violence, particularly sexual violence, in Central Africa, and more recently in India.Her work also includes the economic integration of people with disabilities with local and international NGOs across South Asia, Central America, and Africa. Kade has served as a technical consultant for Amnesty International, UNDP, UNIFEM, and UN Women on issues ranging from pro-poor macroeconomic policy to gender budgeting of post-conflict development assistance.Event detailsDate: Wednesday, 21 January 2026Time: 7:00 PM \u2013 9:00 PMVenue: Fandom at Gilly\u2019s Redefined, KoramangalaHeavy questions, light drinks.
