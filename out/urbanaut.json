The pieces presented are learned from Kalamandalam Chandrika, a direct disciple of Chinnammu Amma, and are carried through the embodied memories of two women dancers.Rooted in tradition yet deeply personal, this performance honors a forgotten lineage in Mohiniyattam. It brings visibility to Chinnammu Amma\u2019s legacy while also acknowledging the continued influence of Amith\u2019s teachers, Nirmala Paniker and Kalamandalam Chandrika. Through this recital, Amith opens a space to reflect on the form\u2019s history, memory, and transmission.Vocal: Rohith AneeshNattuvangam: Sreenima N P.Amith K.Amith K is a scholar, dancer, and choreographer with a PhD from Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. His work explores the intersections of caste, culture, and history in modern Kerala, with writings on gender, dance, and society. Through Mohiniyattam, he challenges hierarchies within the art world, blending scholarship and performance.",

    "description": "Samyoga \u2013 Khayal Se Kriti TakA unique confluence of Hindustani and Carnatic musical traditionsSamyoga \u2013 meaning union or coming together \u2013 is an evocative musical production that intricately weaves together the rich threads of India\u2019s two great classical traditions: Hindustani and Carnatic music. Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), Samyoga is a celebration of both the shared roots and the distinctive aesthetics of these traditions. This presentation of Samyoga will be an unplugged, voice-only exploration, where two voices come together, accompanied by live tanpuras to create an immersive and meditative musical experience.Traversing the expanse of Indian music, the concert explores genres ranging from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotional depth of Bhakti Sangeet, and from the emotive beauty of Thumri and Jawali to the dramatic expressiveness of Natyasangeet. Each piece is carefully curated to highlight both the convergence and divergence in approach, structure, and emotion across the two systems.Through a seamless blend of performance and narration, Samyoga offers audiences more than just a concert\u2014it presents a musical journey, providing insights into the evolution, nuances, and interconnections between genres.\u00a0Interestingly, both Radhika and Manasi are alumni of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who chose to follow their hearts into the world of music. Today, they are recognised not only as accomplished performers but also as dedicated researchers in the field of Indian music.\u00a0",

    "description": "Just as we leave our footprints on its paths, the city where we live leaves an imprint on us. Its spaces shape our experience; its sights and sounds surround us; its food fuels us to keep going; its traffic stalls us in our tracks. In this generative writing workshop, participants are invited to map their unique experiences of life in Bengaluru through poetry. We\u2019ll read place-poems to consider various approaches to writing about the city, and engage in a series of activities to reflect on history and lore, memory, sensory experience, landscape, language, and the ways that our city has changed over time. Through guided writing exercises, mapmaking, reading, discussion, and recitation, we\u2019ll explore the many ways we interact with Bengaluru, writing to collectively remember and reimagine what our city means to us.This workshop is part of Luru Magazine's issue 02 launch at Sabha.About the facilitator:Devi Sastry (she/her) is a writer, teacher, and editor from Bengaluru. Her life and her work revolve around food, family, and multilingualism. She holds an MFA in poetry from New York University, and she has taught creative and critical writing at NYU and Montclair State University. Her writing has been published or is forthcoming in\u00a0Wasafiri, dhoop magazine, Poetry Northwest, Honey literary, and Bengaluru Review, among other publications. She works with multiple organisations creating learning materials to promote humanities education.",
