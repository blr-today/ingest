    "description": "Discover the history of the Bengaluru fort on this walk. The Fort though today reduced to a mere fraction of its original expanse\u2014less than 5%\u2014remains one of the most significant remnants of the city\u2019s pre-colonial past. This heritage walk invites you to step into the vestiges of a fort that once bore witness to battles transitions of power architectural ingenuity and political resilience.The fort began as a modest mud structure before being fortified with stone during Hyder Ali\u2019s rule and later expanded under his son Tipu Sultan. These walls though weathered by time preserve within them the layered narratives of a growing urban center and the complexities of South Indian resistance to British expansion.A highlight of the walk is the iconic Tipu Sultan\u2019s Summer Palace a rare example of Indo-Islamic architecture with its intricate wooden pillars frescoes and elegant symmetry. Once the seat of royal administration and leisure the palace offers insights not only into architectural aesthetics but also into the socio-political life of the Sultanate in the 18th century.As we navigate the narrow lanes of Old Bengaluru one encounters a little-known but historically important site: a surviving armoury tucked into the urban sprawl and forgotten by modern maps. Used during Tipu\u2019s reign this structure is a physical testament to the city\u2019s martial past and the strategic importance of Bangalore in Mysore\u2019s military planning.A focal point of this walk is the Battle of Bangalore (1791) a critical campaign during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. The battle pitted the British East India Company against Tipu Sultan\u2019s forces and highlighted not only the military prowess of the Sultanate but also broader geopolitical shifts\u2014especially the fallout of British actions in other global theatres such as in the American Revolutionary War.It is particularly notable that the Mysorean rockets used innovatively during this time caught the attention of British military observers. Some of these designs later found their way into documentation that would influence the development of European\u2014and even American\u2014military technology. Legend holds that they partly inspired Francis Scott Key\u2019s reference to \"the rockets' red glare\" in the Star-Spangled Banner.Finally the walk concludes with a return to the present\u2014by way of South Indian culinary tradition offering participants a curated local snack and a cup of filter coffee. A reminder that history does not only reside in books or ruins\u2014it lives on in tastes traditions and memories.This walking tour is not just about stones and structures. It is a curated window into Bengaluru\u2019s transformation\u2014from fortified stronghold and seat of regional power to colonial outpost and finally to modern metropolis. In walking its paths we do not merely observe history; we retrace it.Note : \"This walk is led by a Bengaluru native and professional architect who has lived and studied in the vicinity of the fort for over three decades. His deep-rooted connection to the area combined with his architectural expertise gives him an intimate knowledge of not just every corner of the fort but also the rich history that surrounds it.\"",

Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.This support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.The support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

    "description": "Dr Gopi Chandroth, author of INDISHMAN \u2013 Reflections from India, Britain and the Sea, will be at Atta Galatta Bookstore in Indiranagar on 1 February, from 4.30 pm to 6 pm. He will talk about selected stories and engage informally with the audience. Signed copies of the book will be on sale.The following are sample extracts from reviews on Amazon globally and on Goodreads:\u2022 India: \u201cINDISHMAN reminded me of the lyrical beauty of Arundhati Roy, the vivid storytelling of Salman Rushdie, and the magic of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\u201d\u2022 UK: \u201cA lovely meander through the vagaries of human nature. Each story warms the heart like a good malt whisky. A very well-written book; I defy anyone not to enjoy it.\u201d\u2022 USA: \u201cIt (INDISHMAN) is hard to slot into a specific genre \u2013 the stories, reflections and gentle musings flit from rural Kerala to Nepal, from Southampton to the high seas with ease. They strike the perfect balance between being sharply observed and deeply memorable, yet light enough for an effortlessly enjoyable read, and never without a touch of humour and heart. Without a doubt, this has been the best six dollars and change I\u2019ve spent in a very long time.\u201d",

Together, these elements create a space where words are not merely heard, but felt \u2014 allowing the audience to touch closure, clarity, and a softer, steadier kind of inner peace.Shaam-e-Baazgasht | Bengaluru Diaries offers an evening of listening, pausing, and returning \u2014 to oneself.

Just a short ride from the metro, the space feels like a pause from the city, where you can slow down, breathe a little, and spend time outdoors.The experience begins with a guided walk through the farm, where you will see what is growing during winter and learn about seasonal vegetables from Karnataka. We will talk about what grows in this season, why it grows, and how different regions traditionally cook with these ingredients.After the walk, you will sit down between the fields for a relaxed conversation about winter produce, followed by a watercolour painting session by Sangeetha Alwar from Mysore. Surrounded by pumpkins, greens, and roots, you will paint winter vegetables as still life. No prior art experience needed. This is about observing, experimenting, and enjoying the process.In the afternoon, a seated five course meal will be served on the farm by Ole Project. Each course highlights winter vegetables in comforting and creative ways, with small stories from Kannadiga kitchens shared along the way.Before you head back, you will get to harvest fresh greens from the farm yourself and take them home. This is not a rushed event. It is meant to be slow, grounding, and joyful.",

    "description": "Join us at Atta Galatta for a book reading with Dena Merriam, author of Sita\u2019s Yoga: The Yoga of Awakening, a reflective and spiritually resonant work that reimagines Sita as a guide for inner transformation.In this book, Dena Merriam explores Sita not only as an avatar of the divine Narayani, but as a compassionate presence in the lives of ordinary people\u2014those navigating family, work, duty, and the search for meaning. Through these encounters, the narrative turns inward, examining the everyday battles we face with anger, greed, fear, arrogance, and indifference. Ravana emerges as a powerful symbol of the forces that pull human consciousness toward materialism and delusion, both in Sita\u2019s time and our own.Written with clarity and depth, Sita\u2019s Yoga: The Yoga of Awakening invites readers to look within, to recognise and transform the shadows of the mind and heart, and to discover how inner awakening becomes the foundation for confronting the challenges of the outer world.Date: Sunday, 1 FebruaryTime: 5:00 PM \u2013 7:00 PMVenue: Atta Galatta, Bengaluru",

    "description": "Within the Mind Lantern, is a beautifully collection of 41 poems, that has been very well received by the early readers. It is thoughtfully divided into four soul-stirring sections that reads like a gentle walk through memories, emotions, and quiet self-realization. With this poetry collection, the author lights small lanterns within the reader\u2019s mind, guiding them inward. The first section, poems on Nostalgia and Memories, feels like revisiting old photographs, bittersweet, familiar, and deeply comforting. They remind us how memories shape who we are, even when they hurt a little. In the section - Love, Family and Relations, the author captures the beauty of connection, the fragility of bonds, and the unspoken love that often lives between silences. The section on Nature, with gentle metaphors, the poems flow effortlessly, grounding the reader while offering moments of calm and reflection. The final section, Personal Growth and Inspiration, feels like a soft hand on your shoulder, encouraging, reassuring, and deeply empowering. They remind us that growth is personal, nonlinear, and beautifully imperfect. Within the Mind Lantern is not meant to be rushed. It is meant to be felt, revisited, and held close on quiet days. A luminous collection that speaks to the heart, this book is a perfect read if you are looking forward to reconnecting with yourself!Readers are invited to meet the author and get their copies signed at Atta Galatta.",

    "name": "Pint of View (Lecture 34): Ten Million Fireflies",
    "description": "Ten Million Fireflies: What the night reveals when we learn to look: finding wonder, purpose, and policy in the darkMost of us here know this feeling. That sudden urge to leave the city behind. To drive out late at night, or take a trip to a remote village or up into the hills. Just to look up and catch a glimpse of a meteor shower. To see the galaxy with our own eyes. To sit in the dark long enough for stars to appear. And sometimes, if we\u2019re lucky, to spot fireflies flickering in the distance.But then we return. To brighter streets, whiter lights, glowing windows. And slowly, without quite noticing, the night becomes something flatter. Emptier. Easier to ignore.A few years ago, while searching for stars near his home in India, Sriram noticed the same disappearance we often do. The stars were harder to find. But something else caught his attention instead. Large populations of fireflies, glowing steadily in the dark.The night, it turns out, is Sriram\u2019s natural habitat. Under skies full of stars and forests alive with fireflies, he found not just wonder, but purpose. An engineer by training, working at Google, he made an unlikely choice. He left the job and move towards the night.What makes someone do that? How can looking up at the sky, or down at a firefly, redirect an entire life? And can stories, told well enough, change how we light our cities, protect our forests, and shape public policy?In this Pint of View lecture, Sriram will take us into the jungles after sunset. Into rare firefly behaviours, fragile nocturnal habitats, and the unseen costs of artificial light. He will share how astronomy, photography, and storytelling became tools for conservation, and how paying attention to the night can still change everything.About the Speaker:Sriram Murali has a deep passion for astronomy, fireflies, and the night. He tells stories that emotionally connect people to the wonders of the night and to the ill effects of losing it. His films on starry skies and light pollution have inspired many to look up, take action, influence policymakers, and champion dark-sky movements.Through his work on fireflies in the Western Ghats, Sriram has influenced state governments to address light pollution in India. He is a National Geographic Explorer and an IUCN SSC expert on fireflies and light pollution. Sriram and his team at Wild and Dark Earth (an NGO) collaborate with scientific institutions, government bodies, and the lighting industry to restore natural darkness for wildlife.Event detailsDate: Sunday, 1 February 2026Time: 6 PM \u2013 8 PMVenue: 1st Floor, Atta Galatta, IndiranagarWhat your ticket includes1 complimentary sober beverage (soda, kombucha or gingerale from Local Ferment Co.)",

    "description": "Our mind and our body are deeply connected to each other. What the mind forgets the body stores as memory. Infact every single emotion we have ever felt is stored in our nervous system. The nervous system has only one main goal - to scan for safety and danger to keep us safe.\u00a0What the body senses are a danger makes the nervous system develop a coping mechanism. While this protects us from the initial danger/threat, we forget the danger has passed\u00a0 and continue to behave/react the same way long after the threat has eased. This is the reason we keep repeating behaviours and thoughts even though we know it isn't helping.\u00a0At this workshop you will understand the cause and effect behind this. And you will experience a powerful healing modality through your own breath.\u00a0To release stored trauma or suppressed emotions using your own breath. ",

Rather than tracing genres or timelines, it listens to how these different strands overlap,  how music grows in conversation with the city around it.Designed for a small group, the session unfolds in short listening blocks with brief reflections, leaving space for attentive listening and conversation. No prior knowledge is required, just the willingness to sit with sound and notice what surfaces.",

    "description": "\u200bMany of us grew up learning to think of land as a resource; a resource to be managed. This way of thinking about land was seen as neutral and practical. We were taught by well-intentioned geography teachers to studiously mark out on political maps of India, where we might find coal, bauxite and iron with little triangles, circles and squares.\u200bBut what does that framing leave out?\u200bAcross many cultures and times, land has not been understood as inert or separate, but as alive, animate. In these understandings, humans were active participants in the conditions that allowed life to thrive in the lands they lived on. Research and lived histories increasingly suggest, for example, that the supposedly pristine, untouched Amazonian Rainforest was in fact shaped by humans over thousands of years. It is the same story closer to home with Adivasis and nomadic pastoralists having profoundly shaped landscapes that we see as wild.\u200bWhile such forms of intimacy with the land may feel distant for many of us with urban lives today, our disconnection from land, seeing it as object, seeing it as resource than living presence, is a very, very recent phenomenon in our long human story.\u200bWithout romanticizing realities we may never have known, this gathering invites us to explore connections we may have forgotten and longings that are waiting to be discovered.Because we have limited spots - please register only if you can really be there!",

This workshop offers a gentle pause - to settle, ground, and reconnect with yourself.Through soft yoga movement, calming breath awareness, and reflective journaling, we\u2019ll create space for the body to unwind and the mind to soften. The session is slow-paced, choice-based, and beginner-friendly, with no pressure to perform or push.The intention is not to \u201cfix\u201d anything, but to listen, slow down, and leave feeling more settled and present.No prior yoga or journaling experience is required.You\u2019re welcome exactly as you are.
