Through the act of making marks on fabric, participants will explore how simple, repetitive stitches can convey complex emotions, transforming inner feelings into tangible, creative expressions.This is a shorter, more affordable version of our full-length workshops, designed to be accessible to a wider audience. Basic materials will be provided. If you\u2019d like to bring your own fabric or threads to make the experience more personal, you\u2019re welcome to do so. No prior stitching experience needed.Please Note: All proceeds from this workshop go toward supporting and sustaining Rafooghar's community space in New Delhi where women who live on the margins gather every Sunday for rest, leisure, and emotional repairDesigned and facilitated by Rafooghar-the house that mendsOrganized by The Drawing Room ClubSpace courtesy: Cafe ZubaanJoin The Drawing Room Club here:https://chat.whatsapp.com/Jl5TUSVgxBU9ZOI1oMMYO4",
