Usiru Breathwork guides you to re-train your nervous system using breath, scientific, somatic, and meditative tools so you can heal anxiety, calm your mind, and restore inner peace.Under the guidance of Raanika D. Kararia, an experienced breath master and healer, this session integrates breathwork, meditation, energy release, and guided healing techniques to support deep relaxation and enhance resilience and adaptability. We conduct an HRV coherence assessment before and after the breathwork session to measure shifts in autonomic balance. The change in coherence and variability reflects how effectively the practice activates the parasympathetic system. A simple Nervous System Score is also provided to indicate emotional regulation and overall well-being.",

    "description": "In an era where Gen Zs and millennials seek meaning through experiences rather than possessions, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle \u2013 Stories of Friendships & Adventures in Nature offers exactly the kind of soulful escape today\u2019s young adventurers crave. For those who live for spontaneous road trips, mountain treks, beach escapades, and serendipitous conversations with strangers\u2014and secretly nurture the hope of finding love and companionship along the way\u2014Priyanka Kumar\u2019s latest collection is a deeply relatable read. With its mix of short stories and memoir-style reflections, this book resonates with those who believe that real connection and personal discovery often happen far away from the familiar.The newest installment in Priyanka\u2019s celebrated People\u2019s Kafe series, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle brings together heartfelt stories and travel-infused memories that capture the healing magic of nature and the unspoken bonds we form with people and places. Though it\u2019s not a travelogue in the conventional sense, the book reads like one\u2014with vivid glimpses into landscapes and emotions that stay with the reader long after they turn the final page.And yet, the book is as much about the people as it is about the places. There are tales of peacocks who roamed her childhood garden like kin, strangers-turned-friends on spontaneous journeys, and even encounters that subtly hint at love blossoming when least expected. The presence of love\u2014gentle, unforced, and organic\u2014is a quiet undercurrent in a couple of these stories, offering a warm, relatable thread for every romantic dreamer who has ever looked out of a train window and wondered, what if?",

    "name": "My Life Closed Twice: Book Launch",
    "description": "Author Subhashini Kaligotla launches her new poetry collection My Life Closed Twice (Copper Coin, 2025), with Jeet Thayil.In My Life Closed Twice, Subhashini Kaligotla charts the long aftermath of grief, and its recursive, obsessive cadences. Drawing on premodern India\u2019s art, literature, and history, through invented forms and received ones, in fragments, litanies, lists, and queries, the poems in this spare volume embody the psychological terrain of the grieving. Two premature deaths are at the heart of the book. Kaligotla writes of their immediate aftereffects and their enduring impact. She braids her voice with voices from India\u2019s past\u2014from the unknown bards of the Sanskrit epics who counsel equanimity in the face of catastrophe to the laments of Ashoka, Bilhana, and Jahangir.Author BioSubhashini Kaligotla is a poet and an art historian of ancient and medieval South Asia. She is author of the poetry collection Bird of the Indian Subcontinent and the monograph Shiva\u2019s Waterfront Temples. She teaches at Columbia, dividing her time between New York City and Hyderabad.Advance Praise for My Life Closed TwiceSubhashini Kaligotla\u2019s ingeniously fashioned poetic structures\u2014which are light, flexible, delicate yet possessed of remarkable tensile strength and architectural clarity and integrity\u2014aren\u2019t just beautiful in themselves. They\u2019re also vessels for deep imaginative feeling and thinking and wondering and longing. She has a unique, compelling lyric voice and a distinguished twenty-first century consciousness.-Vijay SeshadriAnger, denial, bargaining, despair, all the stages of grief except acceptance, each stage overlaid with the forensic precision generated by love when it has nowhere to go. These enraged, laceratingly plainspoken poems burn with the singular self-awareness that is the writer's curse, and the writer's gift. Two deaths enclose the book like 'two dates // enclosed / by parentheses'. It is impossible to read, say, 'Only Your Brother Will You Lose' \u2013 its fifty shards hammered into the flesh like fifty nine-inch nails \u2013 and come away unscathed. -Jeet Thayil",

    "description": "This is an immersive learning space for people who want to practice Shibari but haven't found the right space, people or facilitator in India to learn from.The goal of these six week courses is to facilitate regular, structured Shibari practice that aims to go deep rather than broad, helping you to develop a really firm grasp of rope bondage fundamentals, build muscle memory, and get to know other participants. The classes will be conducted every Saturday afternoon and will be led by Amiya, Founder of Silly Hands Shibari.The 6-week cohort is limited to a select group of registered participants only. No walk-ins.Each ticket gives you entry for 2 People i.e you + your rope partner. What is Shibari?Shibari is a contemporary form of rope bondage that was originated in Japan in the early 1200-1800's. Later popularized in the 21st century as a pleasure-craft. Shibari, despite its various styles, adheres to a certain aesthetic and exclusively uses ropes as a primary tool to build trust and connect with oneself and others.What to expect?3 hour weekly in-person hands-on lessons100% Vetted ParticipantsJapanese Asanawa (Hemp ropes) for the classFree access to Rope Jams1:1 Technical & Safety guidance throughout the programPost-course integration supportLimited Edition SHS MerchThis is a structured learning space that explores mind\u2013body engagement through rope. The course supports flexibility in awareness, communication, and embodied practice, using rope as a practical and intentional tool. Safety, consent, and consistency remain central to the learning process.We will cover the fundamental knots, frictions, patterns, harnesses, and introduces participants to important skills such as rope handling and tensioning. By the end of the course, participants should understand how to construct a short rope scene that brings together technical and playful elements.Further InformationDates: Every Saturday starting 24th January, 2 pm - 5 pm.Where: The Bangalore Local, Koramangala, Bengaluru.Who can Join :Adults 21+ with no prior experience but plenty interest, LGBTQIA+ solo or with a rope partner.The ticket gives you entry for 2 People i.e you + your rope partner.Participants who sign up solo are encouraged to partner up with another solo-participant to practice the ties on each other. If you don\u2019t want to switch (both tie and be tied), then we would recommend coming with a partner.About the Facilitator: Amiya Bhanushali (she/they) is a queer multidisciplinary artist, contemporary curator and creative strategist. Her work explores art, human connection and design across all disciplines, with a focus on Indian and South Asian narratives. They began to explore Shibari in 2022 as an extension of their art and research into kink-based practices. As their style naturally progressed beyond aesthetics alone, they began to discover interconnections between queerness, pleasure, trauma and neurodivergence.Questions?

    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where lectures meet drinks in a relaxed pub-style setting.We're super stoked to host our first ever genomic lecture! Enough hoo-ha about space; let\u2019s take a deeper look at what all of life on earth is coded by. What is it really, and why does it matter for the rise and survival of life on Earth?It was 1859 when Darwin and Wallace co-described the theory of evolution by natural selection, which turned the then-existing perception of life upside down. Nearly a century later, something else happened: the discovery of the acid of life demystifying how life is coded and how this code gets passed on through generations!In this lecture, Ashwini talks about today's research on genomes \u2013 an organism\u2019s entire collection of the DNA and how its evolution drives both long-term and short-term changes to life. All this over a complimentary drink from Kling brewery! \ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udde0 What to Expect\ud83d\udcad A 45-minute lecture\ud83d\udcac 15\u201320 minutes of Q&A to question, debate, and discuss\ud83c\udf79 A 30-minute mixer to connect with fellow curious minds\ud83c\udf7a One complimentary Kling brewery beer or mocktail with your ticket\ud83e\udd68 \u00c0 la carte food available throughout the day\u2728 Conversations and one-on-one with the speaker post-talkEvent Details\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, 21st December 2025 | 12 PM \u2013 2 PM\ud83d\udccd Kling Brewery, Church Street, Bangalore\ud83d\udc64 About the SpeakerAshwini V Mohan is a postdoctoral researcher at the Biodiversity Genomics lab at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. Born and trained in India until her PhD, she moved to Germany to pursue a PhD with the German Academic Exchange Service\u2019s scholarship.Her research has focused on speciation at different scales\u2014from microevolutionary processes like population divergence to macroevolutionary perspectives on species and trait diversification. While most of her pre-doctoral and doctoral research focused on reptile systems, she pivoted towards comparative genomics with the EU Horizon\u2019s Marie Curie postdoctoral grant. Through this work, she developed novel perspectives to measure genomic rearrangements and later provided an opinion on the putative roles of 3D genome organisation in speciation.How genomes evolve, and how their evolutionary paths influence speciation and trait evolution in organisms, is the big question of her research. More recently, she has been thinking about the role of epigenetic changes to genomes and its effects on genome and organismal evolution. She thoroughly enjoys communicating science to the public and is passionate about good mentorship practices, equity, diversity, and the growth of women in academia.\ud83c\udf7b About Pint of ViewPint of View is inspired by the Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., and we\u2019re bringing this format to India across major cities.
