For us, exploring a new country isn\u2019t complete without a visit to the local grocery stores to discover fresh produce and unique ingredients. Cooking and hosting have always been second nature to us, and as proud Pahadi women, we\u2019ve embarked on a journey to rediscover and preserve the rich culinary heritage of the Garhwal region.For us, food is more than just sustenance\u2014it\u2019s a way to connect, to share, and to bond. Through this pop-up, we want to bring people together to savor authentic Garhwali flavors while immersing in the history, culture, and traditions that make each dish special. It\u2019s not just a meal; it\u2019s a celebration of heritage and a chance to create meaningful memories around the table.We hope to see you soon!\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f- Salomi & Pushkina",
