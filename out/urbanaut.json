Leave with a page, a memory, or a feeling you can\u2019t quite explain yet.No pressure. No labels. Let art do the talking - the rest can happen between the lines.The space will be gently held and facilitated by Your Journal Project (Yukti).You\u2019ll get: all art materials & thoughtful curiosity-led promptsYou\u2019ll take: your artwork, a new third place to quietly call home, and maybe a date\u2026 or at the very least, a friend.NOTE: \u20b9200 cover fully redeemable on F&B at the venue.",

With no scripts and nothing planned, every show exists only once.The Extra // Ordinary show isn\u2019t just about exaggerating the ordinary. It\u2019s about letting the ordinary take up space, stretching it, sitting with it, and following it wherever it naturally leads. Sometimes that becomes funny, sometimes absurd, and sometimes extraordinarily human.Suitable for ages 13+. May include occasional strong language and mature themes. Parental guidance advised.About COOPCOOP (Council of Ordinary People) is a Bengaluru-grown troupe of improvisers that does not hesitate to push the boundaries of improv beyond punchlines. We are creating a space where we use improv for collective storytelling with more depth and narrative range.

    "description": "About the play:The Prophet and the Poet is based on the exchange of letters and articles between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore over 25 years, with the Indian freedom struggle as the backdrop. The letters reveal how the two personalities differed significantly on the form and content of the freedom movement. The differences widened over the years. However, the depth of their personalities maintained genuine respect for each other in spite of deep differences on ideological grounds. It reflected the political maturity of those times in India. Bangalore Little Theatre was privileged to be invited to stage the opening shows of the play at the places hallowed by Gandhi and Tagore in their lifetime \u2013 Sabarmati Ashram, Santiniketan (Visva Bharati) and Jorasanko in Kolkata. The Kolkata performance was at the courtyard stage of Thakurbadi, the Tagore ancestral home, now a heritage site looked after by Rabindra Bharati University. On the occasion of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s birth anniversary, the play was staged at the Raj Bhavan, Bangalore, with the President of India in attendance. Later, the play was performed by invitation in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh, as part of the India-Bangladesh Joint Celebrations of Tagore\u2019s 150th birth anniversary. Prasar Bharati commissioned a tele-film of the play. The film was telecast several times over Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti. There have been about 130 performances of the play since its opening. The play has generated much interestoutside India as well. It has had two American productions, one in Houston and the other at the University of Iowa. Productions in UK and Ireland are also planned. A highly successful tour of Trinidad & Tobago was followed by performances in Singapore, co-hosted by Tagore Society and the Indian High Commission.

    "description": "In the Morning Light is a concert series hosted at Ram\u2019s Musique Experience, designed for unhurried listening in the quiet hours of the day. Curated as morning performances, the series invites audiences to experience music with attention, calm, and presence \u2014 before the noise of the day sets in.This edition of In the Morning Light features sitar artist Navya Rudrappa, accompanied by Karthik Bhat.Navya Rudrappa is known for her thoughtful, grounded approach to the sitar, drawing from Indian classical traditions while allowing space for reflection and subtle exploration. Her performances emphasise patience, tonal depth, and the natural unfolding of musical ideas \u2014 making her work especially resonant in an intimate morning setting.Accompanied by Karthik Bhat, the concert is shaped as a dialogue rather than a display \u2014 allowing rhythm, silence, and resonance to coexist. The focus remains on attentive listening, where the music is given time to breathe and settle.In the Morning Light is not about spectacle or volume. It is about beginning the day with intention \u2014 through music that unfolds slowly and stays with you.",

    "description": "Game of Dholes: Saving India's Wild Dogs Amidst Power, Pack Politics and PredatorsIn this Pint of View lecture, we bring you Arjun Srivathsa, a carnivore ecologist whose work sits at the intersection of science, fieldwork and conservation storytelling.India supports nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s carnivores while also being home to over 1.4 billion people. How does such a crowded, contested landscape continue to sustain so many top predators? At the centre of this ecological high-stakes game is one of India\u2019s most fascinating and least understood hunters: the dhole, or Asiatic wild dog.Highly social, remarkably intelligent, and among the world\u2019s most endangered carnivores, dholes play a crucial role in keeping forest ecosystems intact. Yet they live lives shaped by constant negotiation: shifting alliances within packs, rivalries with tigers and leopards, and the growing pressures of human-altered habitats.So what does a dhole\u2019s everyday life actually look like? How do their families function? Who really holds power in the jungle: the tiger, the leopard, or the pack? And could dholes ever emerge as true kings of the forest?Drawing on over 15 years of field research, this talk offers a rare, intimate look into the lives of dholes and the predators they live alongside, with science, stories, and a sense of humour.About the SpeakerArjun Srivathsa is a DST INSPIRE Fellow at the National Centre for Biological Sciences\u2013TIFR, Bengaluru. He received his PhD from the University of Florida (2020), where his research focused on a multi-scale assessment of dhole metapopulations. His work today centres on large carnivores, population ecology, human\u2013wildlife interactions and conservation biology in India.Event detailsDate: Sunday, 15 February 2026Time: 3:00 PM \u2013 5:00 PMVenue: Atta Galatta, First FloorWhat your ticket includes1 complimentary sober drink from Local Ferment Co.Free street-side parkingSeating will be on first come, first served basis.",

They are a result of cultural norms and conversations that were not designed around women navigating motherhood.This facilitated, small-group circle is for mothers who want to reconnect with their desire, confidence, and connection without forcing it. We will talk about intimacy shifts like fatigue, body image, guilt, mental load, and explore practical ways of addressing them. The Pleasure Circle is rooted in honest conversation, guided reflection, and simple tools that support reconnection over pressure.About the facilitator:Nishtha is a marketer, trained dancer and somatic movement practitioner who focuses on intimacy and the pleasure gap women face.

Most professionals have a complicated relationship with visibility.We spend years picking up skills and becoming good at our work, but almost no one teaches us how to talk about it. So many talented people stay invisible online, not because they lack expertise, but because they were never shown how to turn their experience into content that attracts.Content Creators, meanwhile, are experimenting every day. They're learning what platforms reward, how audiences behave, and how to turn content into a serious opportunity. That's why we're hosting this offline professional-creator gathering, a warm, intimate, ask-anything space where you learn from people who've built their presence from scratch, stumbled, succeeded, and are still figuring it out, honestly.Come curious.

This performance begins right there, challenging the idea of limiting celebration to a date on the calendar.Instead, we open a space for real stories.Stories of being a woman.Stories of loving, learning from, and living alongside women.Stories of mothers, teachers, mothers-in-law, partners, sisters, daughters, friends, bosses, colleagues, daughters-in-law\u2014and everything in between.Stories of how men see the women in their lives.Stories of embracing the feminine within.What to ExpectThis unique Playback Theatre experience invites the audience to share personal moments and lived experiences. In real time, our performers will transform these stories into spontaneous theatre using movement, music, and dialogue\u2014honest, unscripted, and deeply human.Threads and Tales is an Applied theater initiative by Lahe Lahe Caravan \u23f1\ufe0fWhen: 8th March | 5:30 \u2013 7:00 PM\ud83d\udccd Where: Atta Galata, Indiranagar\ud83c\udf9f Tickets: 300 rs per person",

Universal.But is it?In this edition of Pint of View, we sit with feminist sociologist Dr. Gita Chadha to ask some uncomfortable questions:Is the culture of science exclusionary?Why are women and other marginalised groups still underrepresented in scientific spaces?Why has \u201cnature\u201d historically been imagined as feminine \u2014 to be studied, controlled, mastered?And why is \u201cobjectivity\u201d built on distance and separation rather than relationship and connectedness?Drawing from feminist science studies, sociology, and decades of pedagogical work, Dr. Chadha unpacks how knowledge itself is shaped by gendered assumptions. This is not a lecture about numbers alone. It\u2019s about ideas, metaphors, institutions and power.Does the way we define science affect who belongs in it?Join us for an evening of inquiry that sits at the intersection of science, feminism and epistemology, all over a pint.Speaker: Dr. Gita ChadhaProfessor, Azim Premji UniversityPioneer of Feminist Science Studies in IndiaEVENT DETAILS\ud83d\udccd Fandom at Gilly\u2019s Redefined, Koramangala\ud83d\uddd3 Sunday, 22 February\u23f0 12\u20132 PM",

    "description": "We scroll past everything.A war.A wedding reel.A protest.A discount code.Smoke over a city.A poem we almost read.And somewhere between all of it, our heart doesn\u2019t get enough time to feel.Zara Sa Yaad Rakhna Hai is an evening of ghazals that refuses to hurry.Seven stories, seven moments we choose not to swipe past.From Ghalib\u2019s unanswered wounds in Ibn-e-Mariamto Mir\u2019s lingering question - Yeh dhuan kahan se uthta hai?from Faiz\u2019s dignified defiance in Aaj Bazaar Meinto a deeply personal new composition being released that evening!this is not just a mehfil.It is a pause.With tabla, harmonium, electric guitar and voice, we sit with stories of loss, desire, forgiveness, protest, memory  and allow music to stretch time.In a world that rewards speed, come choose stillness.Scroll. Stop. Stay.",

Rossini\u2019s operatic brilliance shines through Rossiniana, while contemporary works like Benga Beat and Shamal bring modern rhythm and atmosphere to the programme.Together, these works reveal the versatility of the guitar, exploring traditional themes that expand into new sonic worlds.For more details about the artist please visit: sidharthsarangi.in",
