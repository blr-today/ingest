Travelling with Sienna, Calcutta from their workshop in Santiniketan are senior members of our team who will co-host ceramic workshops for both kids and adults throughout the duration of the residency.The Pop-up shop at The Studio*The pop-up shop is free to access. Named after the colour of the local red soil / \u09b0\u09be\u0999\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u099f\u09bf of Santiniketan, Sienna was born out of a deep appreciation of the rich craft heritage of Bengal. Our creative nerve centre is in Daronda village, Shantiniketan, about 200 km from Calcutta, surrounded by lush greenery, where in 1993 architect & founder Shanta Ghosh built a pottery workshop to support local artisans from the neighbouring areas. Her daughter, now creative head Shuli, took over around 12 years ago. They built the store\u00a0space in Calcutta in 2015 along with a small family run cafe with home staff trained to serve soups, salads and sandwiches. That space evolved over time, especially since the pandemic, and brought the same level of focus and support to food craft, as they had initially for ceramics and textiles. Today Sienna is a design company proudly representing the finest traditional craft techniques of Bengal and bringing it to a national and global stage for engagement with a wider audience.The craft residency at the Courtyard will be a comprehensive and experiential showcase of the various craft mediums we work with. From handmade pottery, copper & brass jewellery made with upcycled fabric waste to textiles made with natural fibres and printed with motifs inspired by all things Bengal.Terms and Conditions : The management is not responsible for any injury or damage that may occur during an event.The access to the pop- up shop is free.
