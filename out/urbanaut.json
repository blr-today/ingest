    "description": "Madhuragati - Every step in Odissi resounds with the sweetness of a cultural aesthetic formed over centuries of aspiration for a higher goal.. To celebrate the beauty of this exquisite dance form arising from the life and beliefs of the people of forgone times till now.\u00a0Anoushka will perform dance works that showcase a range of possibilities highlighting the sculptural and expressive qualities of the Odissi style.The performance features pieces that are seamlessly connected by brief introductory interludes. This carefully crafted format offers an engaging experience for the audience, guiding them through the beauty of the Odissi classical dance form. Originally a sacred ritual dedicated to the gods, Odissi is one of the oldest dance traditions in the world. Odissi speaks of love and union, between the human and divine, transporting viewers to enchanted worlds of magic and spirituality. Its sensuous and lyrical grace reflects both the motifs of Odisha temple sculpture as well as the poetry from the deep wellsprings of Odia music.Anoushka Rahman, disciple of Guru Surupa Sen, is the new soloist and emerging star of The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.She started her Odissi journey with Smt.Dona Ganguly in Kolkata and holds a Sangeet Bhaskar in Odissi dance and a postgraduate degree in Mathematics.Her association with Nrityagram began in 2018 through a Summer Workshop, which paved the way for advanced training under the guidance of Surupa Sen and Pavithra Reddy.\u00a0Recognised for her talent and dedication, she was awarded the Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship. She has performed with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble across India, the US, Canada and Sri Lanka and was presented in a solo debut performance in November 2024.\u00a0At present, Anoushka is a dancer with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.ChoreographyGuru Kelucharan Mohapatra (Sun Maiyy\u0101)Surupa SenMusic CompositionPt.

    "description": "The last Slow Sunday of the year is here!One of my personal highlights this year has been gamifying my goals and making them genuinely fun. For instance, I made a No Food Delivery Days punch card and didn\u2019t order in for an entire month (!). I made another for hitting my book goals. I even created a bingo card of things I wanted to try \u2014 hosting 10 Slow Sundays was one of them.This Sunday, I\u2019d love for us to slow down together and reflect on the beautiful year gone by \u2014 and maybe dream up little things you want to try in the next one. Big goals, tiny experiments, or just gentle intentions. For example, one of my 2026 goals is to reduce my dependence on e-comm apps. Yours could be anything at all.I\u2019ll have everything ready: paper, glue, prompts, and lots of space to think, write, doodle, plan, or play.As always, the theme is only a nudge \u2014 you\u2019re welcome to bring your activity bag stuffed with whatever you feel like working on.Hope to see you, lovelies, for the last Slow Sunday of this beautiful yearWhat is the Eleven AM Club? A space for slow, intentional gatherings where time stretches, stories unfold, and creativity finds room to breathe. At Eleven AM Club, we come together to write, draw, cook, read, play, or simply be\u2014no rush, no agenda, just a day well spent.",

    "description": "In an era where Gen Zs and millennials seek meaning through experiences rather than possessions, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle \u2013 Stories of Friendships & Adventures in Nature offers exactly the kind of soulful escape today\u2019s young adventurers crave. For those who live for spontaneous road trips, mountain treks, beach escapades, and serendipitous conversations with strangers\u2014and secretly nurture the hope of finding love and companionship along the way\u2014Priyanka Kumar\u2019s latest collection is a deeply relatable read. With its mix of short stories and memoir-style reflections, this book resonates with those who believe that real connection and personal discovery often happen far away from the familiar.The newest installment in Priyanka\u2019s celebrated People\u2019s Kafe series, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle brings together heartfelt stories and travel-infused memories that capture the healing magic of nature and the unspoken bonds we form with people and places. Though it\u2019s not a travelogue in the conventional sense, the book reads like one\u2014with vivid glimpses into landscapes and emotions that stay with the reader long after they turn the final page.And yet, the book is as much about the people as it is about the places. There are tales of peacocks who roamed her childhood garden like kin, strangers-turned-friends on spontaneous journeys, and even encounters that subtly hint at love blossoming when least expected. The presence of love\u2014gentle, unforced, and organic\u2014is a quiet undercurrent in a couple of these stories, offering a warm, relatable thread for every romantic dreamer who has ever looked out of a train window and wondered, what if?",

We also stop at a place connected to India's freedom struggle. After that we pay a quick visit to the silk weavers in the neighborhood.If we still have time we might also pay our respects at the tombs of a few Sufi warriors who were martyred during the III Anglo-Mysore war in 1791.Last but not the least we have breakfast at a legendary food spot.",

    "description": "Women have a complicated relationship with money.And it starts early.Many families shield their daughters from anything related to \u2018finance\u2019. This well-meaning protection ends up being a disservice. When these young women step into the real world, they lack the confidence to make financial decisions - not because they\u2019re incapable, but because they were never given information on budgeting, savings and investments.Later in life, many continue to rely on their partners for investment decisions. This dependency on others will only stop when they have the right information and toolkit to take back control.That\u2019s where we come in.Our upcoming session is a safe, private space - where no question is too small or too basic. Really. Come as you are, with your curiosity.We\u2019ll be focusing on one core idea:Building financial security for women.The session at Bangalore will be led by two amazing experts who truly get it.Our speakersSatya SontanamAishwarya NatrajTo give the session structure, we're dividing it up into 3 themes.This is an anonymous Google form https://forms.gle/4or3s4fHtrijigmx6.

    "description": "Kyun Nahi? is an evening shaped around the idea of melody in language, how words carry rhythm, how poetry becomes song, and how emotion moves between the two. Curated by percussionist and composer Viveick Rajagopalan, this special trio performance brings together guitarist Abhay Nayampalli and harmonium player Satyajeet Sanju for a set built exclusively for Ram\u2019s Musique Experience.Across the hour, the trio will explore original compositions, spoken fragments, and reimagined pieces from poetic traditions, letting melody, cadence, and improvisation lead the way. Viveick\u2019s percussive vocabulary, which moves between classical, folk, and contemporary forms, creates the foundation; Abhay\u2019s fluid, exploratory guitar work adds harmony and texture; and Satyajeet\u2019s harmonium brings warmth, breath, and lyrical resonance to the soundscape.The result is not a concert in the traditional sense, but a conversation between rhythm and language, between poetry and melody, between three musicians who listen deeply to one another.Viveick Rajagopalan \u2014 percussionist, composer, and collaborator known for blending classical Indian rhythms with contemporary forms. His work spans folk traditions, global percussion, and innovative cross-genre projects.Abhay Nayampalli \u2014 a versatile guitarist whose sound moves fluidly between jazz, Indian classical influences, and ambient textures. His playing is marked by nuance, clarity, and melodic intuition.Satyajeet Sanju \u2014 harmonium player, vocalist, and composer rooted in Hindustani traditions, known for his warm tonality and sensitive approach to phrasing and improvisation.Curated by Viveick, the trio creates an interplay of rhythm, harmony, and poetry that forms the heart of Kyun Nahi.Join us on Sunday, December 7th, 2025 at 7:00PM for a performance that lingers in the spaces between music and meaning.",

Memories of Isaac Alb\u00e9niz\u2019 Asturias. Chick Corea\u2019s Spain and Bill Evans\u2019 harmonic explorations in Blue in Green.Perhaps you might remember the lines \u201cWe are stardust, we are golden, billion year old carbon\u2026\" Or, Craig Santos Perez\u2019s riff on Pablo Neruda\u2019s Sonnet XVII \u201cI love you like this because we'll only survive / in the nitrogen rich compost of our embrace, / so close that your emissions of carbon are mine, / so close that your sea rises with my heat.\u201dPerhaps the darkness of carbon can awaken new mysteries for us.\"Felt blessed indeed for being privy to this ~ letting Kuki's music & musicality wash over us with such finesse & intricacy ~\" - Parveen Sikand\"Thank you Kuki for your generosity and magic. The songs were personal, you let us into your process of creation, into your mind and its glorious journeys. Still humming a couple of tunes.\" - Rajeev Ravindranathan\"It was a magical and sublime experience. Love, creativity, and music flowed into the entire space and enveloped us.\"- Leenatha Reddy",

This experience is only for people who are our vibe and who know our vibe :)) Love that you found us and we found you. The Long Table is an intimate, slow, and intentionally designed dining experience for people who enjoy thinking as much as they enjoy eating. It brings together a long table, a curated meal and people who enjoy their food better with food for thought. This experience is built for curiosity, intellect, and reflection. It\u2019s a space where ideas around art, philosophy, practices, life, and meaning unfold into conversations. Every element is created to make you pause, exchange perspectives, disagree kindly, find overlaps, and leave a little more expanded than when you walked in.The first edition centres on a theme we believe in deeply: Giving Themes to Your Years. Instead of resolutions or checklists, we explore the practice of choosing an annual guiding theme \u2014 a feeling, intention, or anchor that shapes how the year unfolds. Set against a warm Christmas dinner, this is an evening to think, feel, design, and share. A meal that is as conducive to thinking as it is to connection.",

    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where classroom-styled lectures meet craft cocktails in pubs and bars.In our 21st lecture, we're bringing K. Sridhar, a Particle Physicist, to talk to us about a question that sounds straight out of science fiction, but sits firmly at the cutting edge of modern physics: do we really live in a world with only three spatial dimensions OR are there more hiding in plain sight? Do we live in a world with three spatial dimensions or more? Why would we even want more than three dimensions? If there are more dimensions, why do we not see them? If these dimensions are too small to be seen, can we still find ways to discover their effects in experiments? Why have we not seen them in experiments thus far?Why would physicists even imagine a universe with extra dimensions? If such dimensions exist, why don\u2019t we see them when we look around? Could they be folded up so tightly that they escape everyday perception\u2014and if so, can their presence still be detected through subtle experimental signatures? And perhaps the most intriguing question of all: if these ideas are so compelling, why haven\u2019t experiments revealed them yet?This lecture will take us through the logic, curiosity, and careful scepticism with which physicists grapple with these questions, offering us a glimpse into how far theoretical imagination can stretch, and where experimental reality pushes back. Expect an evening that opens up the universe, shrinks it down again, and leaves us with more wonder than certainty. Also expect to be reaching for multiple pints of Geist beer by the end\u2014because some questions, once asked, demand both thought and refreshment.What to Expect:A 45-minute lecture probing the possibility of hidden dimensions and what it would mean to discover they exist15 minutes of interactive Q&A to dive deeper into the possibilities of these explorationsOne Geist beer on tap + a complimentary appetiser or a mocktail included with your ticketA lively mixer where you can connect with curious minds and share your own perspectives on string theoryEvent Details:\ud83d\udcc5 Wednesday, 10 December | 7 pm to 9 pm\ud83d\udccd Fandom at Gilly's Redefined, Koramangala\ud83d\udcb0 Early bird pricing available for the first 10 ticketsAbout the LecturerK. Sridhar is a particle physicist and novelist who has lived and worked across Bombay and Bangalore. He was previously at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research before moving to the Azim Premji University. He has published close to 150 research papers in physics, along with the book Brane Worlds and Extra Dimensions in the Cambridge Mathematical Monographs Series, and an edited volume titled Breaking the Silo: Integrated Science Education in India. Alongside physics, he is a regular writer on philosophy and the visual arts. His first novel, Twice Written, was published in 2011, followed by a critical edition in 2019, and his second novel, Ajita, was published in January 2025 by Westland Books.About Pint of ViewInspired by the successful Lectures on Tap community in the US, Pint of View brings this format to India for the first time.

    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where lectures meet drinks in a relaxed pub-style setting.We live in a city of gardens, rain trees, jacarandas, tabebuias, boulevards that purple in March and yellow in September, and lakes that may or may not actually be lakes anymore. A city where the seasons don\u2019t just change, they bring in a colourful change. One month the streets are carpeted with pink trumpet petals, another month it feels like the entire city is exhaling gulmohars.We even start associating our favourite city spots with trees as icons. Like the giant Peepal tree that becomes the background for every Cubbon Reads pictures, or the beloved bookstore Champaca that almost seems suspended amongst the trees, or the boulevard when we go through on Old Airport Road.Which is why this edition of Pint of View is called Fantastic Trees and Where We Find Them. It is not going to be just a lecture for botany enthusiasts. It\u2019s going to be your unofficial guide to recognising the giants we walk past every day.Ecologist Akshay Surendra will take you deep into the secret life of trees: how they are born, how they grow, how they have sex (yes, trees), how they die, and why some insist on growing everywhere while others play hard to get.Part storytelling, part pub quiz, part ode to Bangalore\u2019s green soul, you\u2019ll leave this session with a sharper eye, a calmer mind, and a sensory appreciation for the trees that have been quietly holding this city together long before we arrived. All this, over a complimentary Geist beer or mocktail at the gorgeous Jamming Goat 3.0 in Indiranagar.\ud83e\udde0 What to Expect\ud83d\udcad A 45-minute talk that will introduce you to the fascinating lives of trees: how trees are born, how they grow, how they have sex, and how they die\ud83d\udcac 15\u201320 minutes of Q&A to question, debate, and discuss\ud83c\udf79 A 30-minute mixer to connect with fellow curious minds\ud83c\udf7a One complimentary Geist beer or mocktail with your ticket\ud83e\udd68 \u00c0 la carte food available throughout the evening\u2728 Conversations and one-on-one with the speaker post-talk\ud83d\udcc5 Event DetailsSunday, 14th December 2025 | 4 PM \u2013 6 PM\ud83d\udccd Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar, Bangalore\ud83c\udfab Limited to 90 attendees | Super early bird pricing for the first 10 tickets\ud83d\udc64 About the SpeakerAkshay Surendra is an ecologist interested in how wild plants (and sometimes animals) interact with each other, and what those interactions mean for big questions around diversity, conservation and management of forests. He's had the good fortune to study trees and live amongst them in the rainforests of Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands and the Western Ghats. Akshay is currently a visiting faculty, Environmental Studies, at Ashoka University and holds a Ph.D. from Yale University.\ud83c\udf7b About Pint of ViewPint of View is inspired by the Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., and we\u2019re bringing this format to India across major cities.
