Join a gathering of people who\u2019ve travelled, wondered, and returned with something to share. \u2708\ufe0f\ud83e\uddf3\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\ude8cThis is a space for travel stories. You\u2019re encouraged to bring a cherished souvenir from one of your travels. Expect the atmosphere of that hostel living room you\u2019ve never forgotten. \u2728Bring a story if you\u2019d like or simply come curious. You might leave with a new perspective, a shared laugh, or even an itinerary inspired by someone else\u2019s journey. :)About the facilitatorNitya is a slow, solo traveler who\u2019s spent months at a time backpacking through Europe, Southeast and Central Asia with no fixed plans. She\u2019s lived out of hostels, taken long detours, and found meaning in volunteering along the way. Her journeys are guided more by conversations than checklists. To her, travel is about finding the shared essence in the unfamiliar and returning with a deeper connection to the familiar.About the venueDialogues Cafe, Koramangala is known for creating spaces that enable meaningful conversations and a seamless experience. With several events hosted regularly, you\u2019ll have no trouble being guided to the beautiful glass house on the rooftop, where our gathering will take place. See you there! \ud83d\ude42",

And no one\u2019s going to ask you to \u201copen up\u201d if you don\u2019t want to.It\u2019s just a room full of guys who get it\u2014who\u2019ve also felt lost, burnt out, unsure of who they are outside of work or relationships, or just plain tired of pretending to have it all together.We\u2019ll talk about the stuff that doesn\u2019t usually come up\u2014pressure, failure, identity, and what it actually means to be a man right now. You can speak, or just listen. You\u2019ll leave feeling a little less alone, and maybe even a little lighter.No fixing. No judgement.

To release.This Conscious Connected Breathwork journey is an invitation to meet the tender, emotional part of you that still holds the imprints of childhood - the Inner Child.Held in the fertile stillness of the dark moon, this session creates space to uncover unmet needs, release stored emotional residue and restore connection between your Inner Child and Adult Self.Together, we\u2019ll explore:What parts of you are still longing to be seen and held?What patterns are you ready to dissolve?What would it feel like to parent yourself with love, patience, and gentleness?With the breath as your guide, you\u2019ll enter the womb of transformation - where the child within is not only heard, but embraced.This is a space to let go of survival-mode patterns and make space for softness, joy and renewal.We\u2019ll close with a gentle meditation and space to share.Please bring yoga mat and anything you need to feel cozy lying down (scarf, eye mask, shawl etc.)About the Facilitator:Maria is an intuitive healer and guide who transitioned from a thriving corporate career to the healing arts.\u00a0With over 8 years of experience, she weaves Breathwork, Reiki, Tarot, Access Bars, Shadow Constellations, and psychotherapy-inspired methods into deeply grounding and expansive journeys.
