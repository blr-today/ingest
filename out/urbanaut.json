    "description": "An Evening of French Plant-Based Fine Dining \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\u2728Join us at the Studio by Copper + Cloves for an unforgettable culinary experience with our guest chef, Chef Arpitha., who has travelled from Lyon, France. Discover the art of French fine dining\u2014completely plant-based and reimagined in the most exquisite way. The event is a rare opportunity to indulge in ap\u00e9ro d\u00eenatoire - a French tasting menu alongside cocktails.An Ap\u00e9ro d\u00eenatoire is a French culinary tradition that combines the concepts of a cocktail/ aperitif (ap\u00e9ro) and a light dinner (d\u00eenatoire). It\u2019s essentially a relaxed, yet elegant gathering where guests enjoy a variety of small, bite-sized dishes and drinks. Think of it as a sophisticated blend of a cocktail party and a tapas-style meal, where the focus is on flavorful, creative, and beautifully presented finger foods that are filling enough to replace a full dinner.We'll be serving C+C's signature zero-proof cocktails alongside Chef Arpitha's bite-sized food: here\u2019s a sneak peek of the menu:\t\u2022\tTartare\t\u2022\tRisotto\t\u2022\tPanisse\t\u2022\tG\u00e2teau Proven\u00e7ale \u2022\tTerrine\t\u2022\tMoelleux aux Amandes\t\u2022\tRiz au Lait\t\u2022\tSpaces are limited for this intimate 'cocktail party' experience, so book your spot now and treat yourself to an evening of flavour, creativity, and elegance.This is a great place to meet new people! The dishes in an ap\u00e9ro d\u00eenatoire are designed to be enjoyed while mingling, creating a convivial and intimate dining experience. It\u2019s all about savoring the food, the drinks, and the company without the formality of a sit-down meal.\u00a0Arpitha is a chef based in Lyon, France, currently serving as Head Chef at Like an Elephant, a vegan fine dining restaurant.Growing up in a traditional vegetarian family, she was immersed in Ayurveda, one of the world\u2019s oldest sciences, known for its holistic approach to food and lifestyle. A lifelong animal lover, Arpitha has always been driven to create positive change. Embracing veganism gave her a clear vision: to inspire others to enjoy plant-based, delicious food. A passionate foodie, she dreamed of sharing recipes close to her heart. This dream led her to leave a corporate career in India, and dedicate her life to showing the world that incredible meals can be created without animal-based ingredients. Her journey as a chef began in the gastronomy capital of the world, France.\u00a0Arpitha has honed her craft working in esteemed restaurants across Lyon and the South of France, including the first Michelin-starred establishment to offer a 100% gluten-free and plant-based menu, renowned for its commitment to sustainability.Sustainability is a cornerstone of Arpitha\u2019s culinary philosophy. Guided by her deep respect for nature, she exclusively uses natural, seasonal, and locally-sourced ingredients. Through her dishes, she tells a story rooted in her vibrant culinary heritage, offering diners not just a meal, but an immersive journey through rich, layered flavors.Her cuisine is deeply inspired by her grandmother\u2019s recipes from the two countries she calls home: India and France.",
