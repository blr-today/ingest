Having spent years avoiding promotions after the events of Top Gun (1986), Maverick must now confront the ugly past and an uncertain future while tasked with training the next generation of elite fighter pilots for a nearly impossible suicide mission. As the veteran naval aviator prepares the brilliant graduates for the top-secret assignment, stretching the rules to the breaking point, Mitchell has to face an equally critical challenge: navigate through an uncomfortable relationship with a hotshot lieutenant holding a grudge. Can Maverick and his Top Guns perform a miracle, give the enemy hell, and come back home in one piece?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>3 Course Menu:</strong></p><p><strong>TO BE Announced</strong></p>",

Cycling is a popular way to get around, soaking up the extra sunshine. Outdoor concerts, cultural events, and enjoying flammkuchen are all part of the summertime fun. We gather with friends for afternoon drinks like Hugo or Radler (Sweet soda and beer mix), pack sandwiches before a refreshing swim, and fire up the grill for endless N\u00fcrnberger sausages. Of course, no summer outing is complete without a handful of Gummi bears for a sweet on-the-go treat.</p><p><br></p><p>Fresh fruits and berries are a summer highlight, especially those from my mom's garden. Rhubarb and berries find their way into delicious Dampfnudel (German steamed buns), a sweet and satisfying ending to a summer feast. Early summer brings the bounty of asparagus, grilled to perfection and served with a hollandaise sauce. It's a season of long days, a yearning for freedom, and light, fresh food that captures the essence of summer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong> Menu</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong> Hugo </strong></p><p>Sparkling wine with elderflower syrup&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rhababer </strong></p><p>Tangy rhubarb compote with chardonnay sabayone mousse and almond biscuit</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Flammkuchen</strong></p><p>Crisp Alsatian flat bread Creme fraiche, leek and bacon and baby spinach / veg with tomato&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Berries and cream</strong></p><p>Tonka whipped cream, berries, financier and limoncello syrup</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Asparagus</strong></p><p>Mamas Baby potato salad, green asparagus, hollondaise, Salty cured pig ham / smoked carrot for veg</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Radler </strong></p><p>Pils and basil strawberry sorbet</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dampfnudel </strong></p><p>German steam dumpling, tomato and N\u00fcrnberger sausage filling and Gouda Mornay, pangratatto / tofu tomato filling for veg</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Kirsch plotter</strong></p><p>Traditional German chocolate cake with cherries and their seeds</p>",
