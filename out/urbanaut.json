But have you ever wondered what truly fuels this metropolis? Over 100 km away lies its lifeline: the Cauvery River, the single source capable of quenching the city\u2019s vast thirst. Rising to an elevation of 920 meters above sea level, every drop that reaches Bengaluru is part of an awe-inspiring engineering feat, delivering life-giving water across immense distances and elevations. While this feat of human ingenuity is indeed impressive, it underscores a critical reality: the city\u2019s reliance on a distant water source is a fragile solution, one that becomes increasingly unsustainable as demand grows.In this immersive experience on the Apple Vision Pro, transport to the heart of the Cauvery in a way like never before. With stunning 16K 180\u00b0 video narration, stories of conservation and wildlife, you\u2019ll feel the river\u2019s currents as if you\u2019re standing on its banks, surrounded by the beauty of lush landscapes, misty hills, and abundant wildlife. Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey. Watch as dams, pipelines, and pumping stations come to life, illustrating the sophisticated system that transports Cauvery\u2019s finite waters over vast distances to sustain Bengaluru. Feel the river's flow, witness the delicate balance between nature and engineering, and understand both the marvel and the responsibility of relying on a distant water source.An Experience Like No OtherThis is more than just an experience\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to understand the delicate balance that keeps Bengaluru thriving.

But have you ever wondered what truly fuels this metropolis? Over 100 km away lies its lifeline: the Cauvery River, the single source capable of quenching the city\u2019s vast thirst. Rising to an elevation of 920 meters above sea level, every drop that reaches Bengaluru is part of an awe-inspiring engineering feat, delivering life-giving water across immense distances and elevations. While this feat of human ingenuity is indeed impressive, it underscores a critical reality: the city\u2019s reliance on a distant water source is a fragile solution, one that becomes increasingly unsustainable as demand grows.In this immersive experience on the Apple Vision Pro, transport to the heart of the Cauvery in a way like never before. With stunning 16K 180\u00b0 video narration, stories of conservation and wildlife, you\u2019ll feel the river\u2019s currents as if you\u2019re standing on its banks, surrounded by the beauty of lush landscapes, misty hills, and abundant wildlife. Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey. Watch as dams, pipelines, and pumping stations come to life, illustrating the sophisticated system that transports Cauvery\u2019s finite waters over vast distances to sustain Bengaluru. Feel the river's flow, witness the delicate balance between nature and engineering, and understand both the marvel and the responsibility of relying on a distant water source.An Experience Like No OtherThis is more than just an experience\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to understand the delicate balance that keeps Bengaluru thriving.

We not only learn more about Sufism but learn about how this dargah has promoted communal harmony since the past two centuries and more.We then visit an ayurvedic massage center to see how bones are set right. Legend has it that at one of these centers was patronized by the Maharaja of Mysore as would the pehelwans in these areas who practiced khusti in the numerous akhadas.We also visit an old temple/s associated with a saint/s who left his/their mark on the locality. If time permits we will also visit a garadi mane & a heritage lodge close by.Last but not the least we treat our guests to a nice traditional South Indian breakfast at a heritage restaurant in the area.",

    "description": "Smash Guys Burger Residency with BeerThe Smash Guys Burger Residency with Beer marks a thrilling new chapter for The Conservatory, a space that has become a hotspot for culinary innovation over the past two years. We've hosted some of the country\u2019s most exciting chefs and restaurants, recently venturing into international collaborations that have elevated Bengaluru\u2019s dining scene.Now, we\u2019re taking it one step further by introducing a unique residency experience\u2014and who better to kick it off than the Smash Guys? With their expertly crafted burgers and a mission to redefine the city\u2019s burger game, this month-long residency promises to be a delicious adventure you won\u2019t want to miss.Smash Guys is the latest creation from Nikhil and AB Gupta, the culinary masterminds behind The Pizza Bakery and Paris Panini. This time, their mission is bold: to celebrate the art of the burger by bringing the finest styles from across the globe under one roof.After months of meticulously crafting every bite since their smash hit debut at The Conservatory, they\u2019re now ready to take things up a notch with an exciting month-long residency.Smash Guys is here to redefine Bengaluru\u2019s burger scene, filling the flavor void with juicy patties, crisp buns, and creative combinations that promise to thrill every burger lover in town.The dream team behind Smash Guys:\u00a0Chef Guru is the Chef Partner at The Pizza Bakery & Paris Panini. Graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, Australia, his expertise in balancing textures and creating unique sauce combinations brings an unexpected twist to classic burger elements. His commitment to sourcing premium ingredients ensures every component tells its own story while contributing to a harmonious whole.Chef Adithya Kidambi is our friendly neighborhood kombucha scientist. He has built mossant into the best craft kombucha brand in the city, but what few know about him is that he is a trained Chef and self-taught burger scholar who delivered burgers to people during the lockdown post which he sold out at several pop-ups in the city. Adi excels in styles like the Nashville Chicken, Smash Buff/Lamb classics, and Asian-inspired burgers using ingredients like kimchi and miso.Chef Suby is all about chasing the ULTIMATE BURGER DREAM. His obsession with achieving the perfect meat-to-fat ratio and that caramelised crust has led him to experiment with countless grinds and smashing techniques.\u00a0Chef Rohil brings an elegant touch to the veg side of our menu. He completes our trio with his innovative approach to flavour building, and fine-tuning the perfect balance of flavour and texture.Beer on TapTo make this residency even better, The Conservatory will be serving up refreshing beer on tap throughout the month.
