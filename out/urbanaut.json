This multisensory experience, facilitated by Malavika Bhatia and Prithvi Kini of Fungi Foundation, is designed to engage participants with the often-overlooked realm of fungi, emphasising their ecological roles and relationships with other organisms, including humans.The workshop takes participants on a unique fungal adventure, engaging all five senses to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of fungi. By intertwining scientific knowledge with sensory experiences and creative expression, the workshop aims to transform participants' perceptions of fungi from potential disgust to wonder and curiosity.Through a series of interactive stations, participants will explore fungal diversity, examine specimens under microscopes, experience various fungal scents and textures, taste edible mushrooms, and even listen to mushroom-generated music. The workshop culminates in an embodied activity where participants creatively express fungal relationships, fostering a personal connection to these remarkable organisms.Speaker\u2019s Bio:Prithvi Kini is an entrepreneur, yoga practitioner, citizen scientist, and mental health advocate with a deep interest in the therapeutic benefits of mushrooms. As the co-founder of Nuvedo, India's pioneering functional mushroom start-up, her vision is for people to reclaim control of their lives through mushrooms. Through Nuvedo, she forges connections with local farming communities and myriad mycophiles across India and is fostering a mushroom revolution that goes beyond the world of business. With Fungi Foundation India, she's on a mission to revolutionize India's allyship with fungi, not just on a plate but in policy as well. With a commitment to conservation, her interests focus on ethical biodiversity research and Indian ethnomycological exploration. Her vision is to create a kinder, authentic and more accepting India through the power of fungi and applying to rekindle a \u2018more-than-human\u2019 outlook on our ways of life.Malavika Bhatia is a forager, artist, and community facilitator who weaves together ethnomycological research, community-based practices, and theoretical frameworks to reimagine relationships in the more-than-human world. Their art practice inhabits spaces of decay and decomposition, viewing these processes not as endpoints but as vital sites of regeneration and possibility. Through programs with Science Gallery Bengaluru, Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, Sandbox Collective, Serendipity Arts Festival, and others, they create participatory experiences that invite audiences to consider how fungal networks can serve as both metaphor and method for reimagining community relationships and ecological entanglements.Community Campaigning: Success Stories and A Pathway to Change\tThe session will be a deep-dive into the importance of engaging with communities for grassroots advocacy initiatives and impactful public mobilization through digital media.

This talk dives into the hidden impacts of our everyday choices and their toll on the environment. From the dyes in our clothing to the materials we often overlook, consumption patterns are driving a crisis. Color Ashram Foundation brings awareness to the toxic dyes used in the fashion industry and the massive waste created as a result. Consumers for Sustainability highlights the environmental costs of animal-derived materials like wool, leather, and silk\u2014showing how these products consume water, pollute air and soil, and deplete precious land resources.

To achieve this, the country has put in place a dedicated policy to carry out afforestation to compensate for the forests it loses to industries and other project developers. However, how well has this panned out on the ground? Forest communities, who had to give up forest lands that they were dependent on to industries years ago, are now being displaced again as the state is struggling for land to meet its afforestation target. Has the role of forests been reduced to only carbon sequestration?\u00a0\u00a0Speaker\u2019s BioKumar Sambhav Shrivastava\u00a0Founder & Director, Land Conflict WatchKumar Sambhav is a social entrepreneur and award-winning journalist, leading innovative research in accountability investigations.

This multisensory experience, facilitated by Malavika Bhatia and Prithvi Kini of Fungi Foundation, is designed to engage participants with the often-overlooked realm of fungi, emphasising their ecological roles and relationships with other organisms, including humans.The workshop takes participants on a unique fungal adventure, engaging all five senses to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of fungi. By intertwining scientific knowledge with sensory experiences and creative expression, the workshop aims to transform participants' perceptions of fungi from potential disgust to wonder and curiosity.Through a series of interactive stations, participants will explore fungal diversity, examine specimens under microscopes, experience various fungal scents and textures, taste edible mushrooms, and even listen to mushroom-generated music. The workshop culminates in an embodied activity where participants creatively express fungal relationships, fostering a personal connection to these remarkable organisms.Speaker\u2019s Bio:Prithvi Kini is an entrepreneur, yoga practitioner, citizen scientist, and mental health advocate with a deep interest in the therapeutic benefits of mushrooms. As the co-founder of Nuvedo, India's pioneering functional mushroom start-up, her vision is for people to reclaim control of their lives through mushrooms. Through Nuvedo, she forges connections with local farming communities and myriad mycophiles across India and is fostering a mushroom revolution that goes beyond the world of business. With Fungi Foundation India, she's on a mission to revolutionize India's allyship with fungi, not just on a plate but in policy as well. With a commitment to conservation, her interests focus on ethical biodiversity research and Indian ethnomycological exploration. Her vision is to create a kinder, authentic and more accepting India through the power of fungi and applying to rekindle a \u2018more-than-human\u2019 outlook on our ways of life.Malavika Bhatia is a forager, artist, and community facilitator who weaves together ethnomycological research, community-based practices, and theoretical frameworks to reimagine relationships in the more-than-human world. Their art practice inhabits spaces of decay and decomposition, viewing these processes not as endpoints but as vital sites of regeneration and possibility. Through programs with Science Gallery Bengaluru, Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, Sandbox Collective, Serendipity Arts Festival, and others, they create participatory experiences that invite audiences to consider how fungal networks can serve as both metaphor and method for reimagining community relationships and ecological entanglements.Community Campaigning: Success Stories and A Pathway to Change\tThe session will be a deep-dive into the importance of engaging with communities for grassroots advocacy initiatives and impactful public mobilization through digital media.

This talk dives into the hidden impacts of our everyday choices and their toll on the environment. From the dyes in our clothing to the materials we often overlook, consumption patterns are driving a crisis. Color Ashram Foundation brings awareness to the toxic dyes used in the fashion industry and the massive waste created as a result. Consumers for Sustainability highlights the environmental costs of animal-derived materials like wool, leather, and silk\u2014showing how these products consume water, pollute air and soil, and deplete precious land resources.

To achieve this, the country has put in place a dedicated policy to carry out afforestation to compensate for the forests it loses to industries and other project developers. However, how well has this panned out on the ground? Forest communities, who had to give up forest lands that they were dependent on to industries years ago, are now being displaced again as the state is struggling for land to meet its afforestation target. Has the role of forests been reduced to only carbon sequestration?\u00a0\u00a0Speaker\u2019s BioKumar Sambhav Shrivastava\u00a0Founder & Director, Land Conflict WatchKumar Sambhav is a social entrepreneur and award-winning journalist, leading innovative research in accountability investigations.

But have you ever wondered what truly fuels this metropolis? Over 100 km away lies its lifeline: the Cauvery River, the single source capable of quenching the city\u2019s vast thirst. Rising to an elevation of 920 meters above sea level, every drop that reaches Bengaluru is part of an awe-inspiring engineering feat, delivering life-giving water across immense distances and elevations. While this feat of human ingenuity is indeed impressive, it underscores a critical reality: the city\u2019s reliance on a distant water source is a fragile solution, one that becomes increasingly unsustainable as demand grows.In this immersive experience on the Apple Vision Pro, transport to the heart of the Cauvery in a way like never before. With stunning 16K 180\u00b0 video narration, stories of conservation and wildlife, you\u2019ll feel the river\u2019s currents as if you\u2019re standing on its banks, surrounded by the beauty of lush landscapes, misty hills, and abundant wildlife. Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey. Watch as dams, pipelines, and pumping stations come to life, illustrating the sophisticated system that transports Cauvery\u2019s finite waters over vast distances to sustain Bengaluru. Feel the river's flow, witness the delicate balance between nature and engineering, and understand both the marvel and the responsibility of relying on a distant water source.An Experience Like No OtherThis is more than just an experience\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to understand the delicate balance that keeps Bengaluru thriving.

But have you ever wondered what truly fuels this metropolis? Over 100 km away lies its lifeline: the Cauvery River, the single source capable of quenching the city\u2019s vast thirst. Rising to an elevation of 920 meters above sea level, every drop that reaches Bengaluru is part of an awe-inspiring engineering feat, delivering life-giving water across immense distances and elevations. While this feat of human ingenuity is indeed impressive, it underscores a critical reality: the city\u2019s reliance on a distant water source is a fragile solution, one that becomes increasingly unsustainable as demand grows.In this immersive experience on the Apple Vision Pro, transport to the heart of the Cauvery in a way like never before. With stunning 16K 180\u00b0 video narration, stories of conservation and wildlife, you\u2019ll feel the river\u2019s currents as if you\u2019re standing on its banks, surrounded by the beauty of lush landscapes, misty hills, and abundant wildlife. Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey. Watch as dams, pipelines, and pumping stations come to life, illustrating the sophisticated system that transports Cauvery\u2019s finite waters over vast distances to sustain Bengaluru. Feel the river's flow, witness the delicate balance between nature and engineering, and understand both the marvel and the responsibility of relying on a distant water source.An Experience Like No OtherThis is more than just an experience\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to understand the delicate balance that keeps Bengaluru thriving.

    "description": "This event is a part of Bengaluru Hubba, a citywide Arts and Culture fest from Nov 30 - Dec 16Bengaluru\u2014a city of innovation, growth, and resilience, sustaining millions each day. But have you ever wondered what truly fuels this metropolis? Over 100 km away lies its lifeline: the Cauvery River, the single source capable of quenching the city\u2019s vast thirst. Rising to an elevation of 920 meters above sea level, every drop that reaches Bengaluru is part of an awe-inspiring engineering feat, delivering life-giving water across immense distances and elevations. While this feat of human ingenuity is indeed impressive, it underscores a critical reality: the city\u2019s reliance on a distant water source is a fragile solution, one that becomes increasingly unsustainable as demand grows.In this immersive experience on the Apple Vision Pro, transport to the heart of the Cauvery in a way like never before. With stunning 16K 180\u00b0 video narration, stories of conservation and wildlife, you\u2019ll feel the river\u2019s currents as if you\u2019re standing on its banks, surrounded by the beauty of lush landscapes, misty hills, and abundant wildlife. Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey. Watch as dams, pipelines, and pumping stations come to life, illustrating the sophisticated system that transports Cauvery\u2019s finite waters over vast distances to sustain Bengaluru. Feel the river's flow, witness the delicate balance between nature and engineering, and understand both the marvel and the responsibility of relying on a distant water source.An Experience Like No OtherThis is more than just an experience\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to understand the delicate balance that keeps Bengaluru thriving.

We not only learn more about Sufism but learn about how this dargah has promoted communal harmony since the past two centuries and more.We then visit an ayurvedic massage center to see how bones are set right. Legend has it that at one of these centers was patronized by the Maharaja of Mysore as would the pehelwans in these areas who practiced khusti in the numerous akhadas.We also visit an old temple/s associated with a saint/s who left his/their mark on the locality. If time permits we will also visit a garadi mane & a heritage lodge close by.Last but not the least we treat our guests to a nice traditional South Indian breakfast at a heritage restaurant in the area.",
