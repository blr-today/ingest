When these young women step into the real world, they lack the confidence to make financial decisions -\u00a0not because they\u2019re incapable, but because they were never given information on budgeting, savings and investments.Later in life, many continue to rely on their partners for investment decisions. This dependency on others will only stop when they have the right information and toolkit to take back control.That\u2019s is where we come in.Our upcoming session is a safe, private space - where no question is too small or too basic.
