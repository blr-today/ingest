Discovered and embraced by a global gathering, bringing about the \u2018Anjuna Commune\u2019. Free spirits, making their way across exotic Asia on an adventure-filled land route, seeking the unconventional. Growing up here,&nbsp;\u2018Anjunkars\u2019&nbsp;understand that it\u2019s okay to live a life others don\u2019t understand.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Founded by Neil Dsouza, a Goan living in Bombay who moved back to Goa during the pandemic. Slow Tide, conceived during the pandemic redefines the Anjuna Shack. The successful revival of Anjuna's hippie culture by award-winning Architect Palinda Kannangara is reflected in the space, which changes \"Fable\" to \"Table.\" Born in Rajagiriya, Sri Lanka, Palinda\u2019s contextual sensitivity and experimental use of material carried our story forward. Inspired by frequent stays with us over the years, the site has become a generator of all ideas, designs never frozen but continuing to evolve.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong><u>Vegetarian Menu</u></strong></p><p><strong>Pineapple &amp; Grapes Sasam</strong></p><p>Chilli-Lime Rubbed Pineapple &amp; Grapes Sasam Salad with Curried Cashew Sauce &amp; Caramel Rice Puff</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brussels Sprouts &amp; Pumpkin Thoran Tostada</strong></p><p>Brussels Sprouts &amp; Pumpkin Thoran with Fermented Bean Pure &amp; Poppy Seeds Crumble</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chiapas Grilled New Corn</strong></p><p>Charred New Corn with Borracha New Cron with Goat cheese, Pickled lime Salsa &amp; Puffed Jowar</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wild Mushroom Caldine Momos</strong></p><p>Wild Mushroom Momos with Caldine Curry, Radish-Peanut Oistou &amp; Lime Oil</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Puran-Coconut Pataleo</strong></p><p>Gram &amp; Coconut Pataleo with Jaggery caramel Sauce &amp; Almond Granola</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Non- Vegetarian Menu</u></strong></p><p><strong>Red Snapper Crudo</strong></p><p>Red Snapper Ceviche with Chilli-Tamarind Sauce &amp; Seaweed Rice Crisp</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Back Waters Crab Cake</strong></p><p>Green Pepper &amp; Betel Leaf Spiced Crab Cake with Cilantro-Green Apple Chutney &amp; Recheado Aioli</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ceylon Pork Curry Taco</strong></p><p>Sri lankan Blackened Spiced Pork Belly Curry &amp; Pol Roti With Sambol</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mutton Alooni Bhaat</strong></p><p>Goan Mutton (Meat &amp; Bone) Stew with Indrayani Rice Khichadi &amp; Muttton Pickle</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Puran-Coconut Pataleo</strong></p><p>Gram &amp; Coconut Pataleo with Jaggery caramel Sauce &amp; Almond Granola</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Terms and Conditions : </strong></p><ul><li>The management is not responsible for any injury or damage that may occur during an event.</li><li>Do not purchase tickets from anyone other than on the ticketing platform.No shows and cancellations are non-refundable by all means.</li><li>Tickets are non-transferable and are for personal use only.</li><li>Children above 5 years will require a ticket to attend the meal</li><li>Children below the age of 5 are not allowed.</li><li>The schedule is subject to change in case of an emergency or any event out of our control.</li><li>No liability or claims that may arise due to the consumption or intake of any food or drink will be entertained by the management.</li><li>Parking near the event premises is at the risk of the vehicle owner.</li><li>Paid Valet Parking at Rs. 200 per car.</li><li>The holder of this ticket grants organizers the right to use, in perpetuity, all or any part of the recording of any video or still footage made of the holder's appearance on any channel without any further approval of theirs.</li><li>Photographs and videos of ticket holders may be uploaded to social media.
