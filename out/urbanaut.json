Assigned to a chaotic school once led by the mysteriously absent Salma Khatoon, Samiran's efforts to restore order only lead him deeper into unsettling events. From a water shortage to a snake in his room, his attempts to connect with the eccentric villagers only intensify his isolation. But behind it all, Samiran harbors a secret\u2014someone named Vrindaban. Why does he hide this figure? Is it the only refuge in a world that refuses to understand him? The play unravels questions about isolation, hidden truths, and the blurred lines between personal and professional life.About the artist:\u00a0 Somudranil Sarkar, a theatre maker from kolkata.

Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.This support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.The support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

Is it the search for life, the dream of a second home, or something even more profound?

Boo! Ya Watchin?, the brainchild of Mahima. V is a Bangalore-based film screening series that turns cult classics and hidden gems into shared, immersive experiences.\u00a0\u00a0REC (2007) is a Spanish found-footage horror film directed by Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Paco Plaza. The story follows TV reporter \u00c1ngela Vidal and her cameraman as they cover a routine night shift at a fire station\u2014until a call to an apartment building turns their night into a nightmare. Shot in real-time with a claustrophobic, handheld style, REC delivers relentless tension and scares across its tight 75-minute runtime. While its intensity may not resonate with everyone, it\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most terrifying found-footage horrors ever made.Rishi Sippy is a Bangalore-based DJ and is the brain behind beloved dance IPs in the city like Jackfruit Dance Party & Freak Opera.

We will journey together through body activation, deep emotional release, honouring our feminine lineage and ending in celebration and stillness - supported by the heart-opening medicine of cacao.The Flow of the Journey:Opening the Space: Arrival, grounding and intention setting with a warm cup of ceremonial cacao.Dynamic Feminine Release Journey: A guided journey inspired by Osho Dynamic Meditation. Through breath, sound and movement, you will release held emotions, awaken your Shakti and reclaim the untamed power of your feminine essence. We end this segment with dance and celebration - movement as liberation.Honouring the Feminine Lineage: A sacred ritual to honour the women who came before us - our mothers, grandmothers, and all the feminine energy in our lineage. Through letter writing, invocation and womb blessing, we draw on their strength and wisdom, acknowledging the gifts and burdens we carry forward.Mirror of Shakti: A heart-to-heart connection exercise where women witness each other in truth and grace, remembering that the light we see in another is a reflection of our own.Closing Circle: A gentle integration with grounding breath and reflection.Each woman shares one word of what she\u2019s carrying forward. We close with an invocation to Ma Kali - anchoring gratitude and power into our hearts and wombs.Please wear comfortable clothing and bring yoga mat, scarf/shawl, a journal and pen.Cacao will be served at the beginning of the session.About the Facilitator:Maria is a Reiki Master and psychic healer, weaving 9 years of energy work into transformational spaces for emotional, spiritual and psychological healing.
