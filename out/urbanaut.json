    "description": "Discover the history of the Bengaluru fort on this walk. The Fort though today reduced to a mere fraction of its original expanse\u2014less than 5%\u2014remains one of the most significant remnants of the city\u2019s pre-colonial past. This heritage walk invites you to step into the vestiges of a fort that once bore witness to battles transitions of power architectural ingenuity and political resilience.The fort began as a modest mud structure before being fortified with stone during Hyder Ali\u2019s rule and later expanded under his son Tipu Sultan. These walls though weathered by time preserve within them the layered narratives of a growing urban center and the complexities of South Indian resistance to British expansion.A highlight of the walk is the iconic Tipu Sultan\u2019s Summer Palace a rare example of Indo-Islamic architecture with its intricate wooden pillars frescoes and elegant symmetry. Once the seat of royal administration and leisure the palace offers insights not only into architectural aesthetics but also into the socio-political life of the Sultanate in the 18th century.As we navigate the narrow lanes of Old Bengaluru one encounters a little-known but historically important site: a surviving armoury tucked into the urban sprawl and forgotten by modern maps. Used during Tipu\u2019s reign this structure is a physical testament to the city\u2019s martial past and the strategic importance of Bangalore in Mysore\u2019s military planning.A focal point of this walk is the Battle of Bangalore (1791) a critical campaign during the Third Anglo-Mysore War. The battle pitted the British East India Company against Tipu Sultan\u2019s forces and highlighted not only the military prowess of the Sultanate but also broader geopolitical shifts\u2014especially the fallout of British actions in other global theatres such as in the American Revolutionary War.It is particularly notable that the Mysorean rockets used innovatively during this time caught the attention of British military observers. Some of these designs later found their way into documentation that would influence the development of European\u2014and even American\u2014military technology. Legend holds that they partly inspired Francis Scott Key\u2019s reference to \"the rockets' red glare\" in the Star-Spangled Banner.Finally the walk concludes with a return to the present\u2014by way of South Indian culinary tradition offering participants a curated local snack and a cup of filter coffee. A reminder that history does not only reside in books or ruins\u2014it lives on in tastes traditions and memories.This walking tour is not just about stones and structures. It is a curated window into Bengaluru\u2019s transformation\u2014from fortified stronghold and seat of regional power to colonial outpost and finally to modern metropolis. In walking its paths we do not merely observe history; we retrace it.Note : \"This walk is led by a Bengaluru native and professional architect who has lived and studied in the vicinity of the fort for over three decades. His deep-rooted connection to the area combined with his architectural expertise gives him an intimate knowledge of not just every corner of the fort but also the rich history that surrounds it.\"",

    "description": "In an era where Gen Zs and millennials seek meaning through experiences rather than possessions, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle \u2013 Stories of Friendships & Adventures in Nature offers exactly the kind of soulful escape today\u2019s young adventurers crave. For those who live for spontaneous road trips, mountain treks, beach escapades, and serendipitous conversations with strangers\u2014and secretly nurture the hope of finding love and companionship along the way\u2014Priyanka Kumar\u2019s latest collection is a deeply relatable read. With its mix of short stories and memoir-style reflections, this book resonates with those who believe that real connection and personal discovery often happen far away from the familiar.The newest installment in Priyanka\u2019s celebrated People\u2019s Kafe series, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle brings together heartfelt stories and travel-infused memories that capture the healing magic of nature and the unspoken bonds we form with people and places. Though it\u2019s not a travelogue in the conventional sense, the book reads like one\u2014with vivid glimpses into landscapes and emotions that stay with the reader long after they turn the final page.And yet, the book is as much about the people as it is about the places. There are tales of peacocks who roamed her childhood garden like kin, strangers-turned-friends on spontaneous journeys, and even encounters that subtly hint at love blossoming when least expected. The presence of love\u2014gentle, unforced, and organic\u2014is a quiet undercurrent in a couple of these stories, offering a warm, relatable thread for every romantic dreamer who has ever looked out of a train window and wondered, what if?",

Memories of Isaac Alb\u00e9niz\u2019 Asturias. Chick Corea\u2019s Spain and Bill Evans\u2019 harmonic explorations in Blue in Green.Perhaps you might remember the lines \u201cWe are stardust, we are golden, billion year old carbon\u2026\" Or, Craig Santos Perez\u2019s riff on Pablo Neruda\u2019s Sonnet XVII \u201cI love you like this because we'll only survive / in the nitrogen rich compost of our embrace, / so close that your emissions of carbon are mine, / so close that your sea rises with my heat.\u201dPerhaps the darkness of carbon can awaken new mysteries for us.\"Felt blessed indeed for being privy to this ~ letting Kuki's music & musicality wash over us with such finesse & intricacy ~\" - Parveen Sikand\"Thank you Kuki for your generosity and magic. The songs were personal, you let us into your process of creation, into your mind and its glorious journeys. Still humming a couple of tunes.\" - Rajeev Ravindranathan\"It was a magical and sublime experience. Love, creativity, and music flowed into the entire space and enveloped us.\"- Leenatha Reddy",

    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where lectures meet drinks in a relaxed pub-style setting.We live in a city of gardens, rain trees, jacarandas, tabebuias, boulevards that purple in March and yellow in September, and lakes that may or may not actually be lakes anymore. A city where the seasons don\u2019t just change, they bring in a colourful change. One month the streets are carpeted with pink trumpet petals, another month it feels like the entire city is exhaling gulmohars.We even start associating our favourite city spots with trees as icons. Like the giant Peepal tree that becomes the background for every Cubbon Reads pictures, or the beloved bookstore Champaca that almost seems suspended amongst the trees, or the boulevard when we go through on Old Airport Road.Which is why this edition of Pint of View is called Fantastic Trees and Where We Find Them. It is not going to be just a lecture for botany enthusiasts. It\u2019s going to be your unofficial guide to recognising the giants we walk past every day.Ecologist Akshay Surendra will take you deep into the secret life of trees: how they are born, how they grow, how they have sex (yes, trees), how they die, and why some insist on growing everywhere while others play hard to get.Part storytelling, part pub quiz, part ode to Bangalore\u2019s green soul, you\u2019ll leave this session with a sharper eye, a calmer mind, and a sensory appreciation for the trees that have been quietly holding this city together long before we arrived. All this, over a complimentary drink and muffins at the gorgeous Lossfunk space in Indiranagar.\ud83e\udde0 What to Expect\ud83d\udcad A 45-minute talk that will introduce you to the fascinating lives of trees: how trees are born, how they grow, how they have sex, and how they die\ud83d\udcac 15\u201320 minutes of Q&A to question, debate, and discuss\ud83c\udf79 A 30-minute mixer to connect with fellow curious minds\ud83c\udf7a One complimentary drink and muffins with your ticket\u2728 Conversations and one-on-one with the speaker post-talk\ud83d\udcc5 Event DetailsSunday, 14th December 2025 | 4 PM \u2013 6 PM\ud83d\udccd Lossfunk, Indiranagar, Bangalore\ud83c\udfab Limited to 90 attendees | Super early bird pricing for the first 10 tickets\ud83d\udc64 About the SpeakerAkshay Surendra is an ecologist interested in how wild plants (and sometimes animals) interact with each other, and what those interactions mean for big questions around diversity, conservation and management of forests. He's had the good fortune to study trees and live amongst them in the rainforests of Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands and the Western Ghats. Akshay is currently a visiting faculty, Environmental Studies, at Ashoka University and holds a Ph.D. from Yale University.\ud83c\udf7b About Pint of ViewPint of View is inspired by the Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., and we\u2019re bringing this format to India across major cities. It\u2019s where big ideas meet bar tables and you leave with a drink in hand and a new way of seeing the world.Book now & develop your own pint of view! \ud83c\udf7b",
