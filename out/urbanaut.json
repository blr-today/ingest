Crisis of Consumption: India\u2019s Overwhelming Waste Problem and What We Can Do About It\u00a0What do fast fashion and animal agriculture have in common? This talk dives into the hidden impacts of our everyday choices and their toll on the environment. From the dyes in our clothing to the materials we often overlook, consumption patterns are driving a crisis. Color Ashram Foundation brings awareness to the toxic dyes used in the fashion industry and the massive waste created as a result. Consumers for Sustainability highlights the environmental costs of animal-derived materials like wool, leather, and silk\u2014showing how these products consume water, pollute air and soil, and deplete precious land resources. Join us to discover the real costs behind these industries and explore pathways toward more sustainable choices.Speaker\u2019s Bio:Seemanthini C. is the Project Coordinator at Consumers for Sustainability, an initiative dedicated to promoting consumer protection and fostering sustainable practices across sectors. With a background in biotechnology and a wealth of experience in organising educational camps and outreach programs, she is a strong advocate for capacity and community building. She believes these are essential tools for creating a ripple effect that strengthens the sustainability movement and inspires meaningful change.Namrata Bhutoria has been studying the toxic nature of colors - Chromatopia as a topic for long and has been able to successfully offer training and solutions in the form of natural colors. She believes that true learning happens with reflection, connection, and also brings personal transformation.

Crisis of Consumption: India\u2019s Overwhelming Waste Problem and What We Can Do About It\u00a0What do fast fashion and animal agriculture have in common? This talk dives into the hidden impacts of our everyday choices and their toll on the environment. From the dyes in our clothing to the materials we often overlook, consumption patterns are driving a crisis. Color Ashram Foundation brings awareness to the toxic dyes used in the fashion industry and the massive waste created as a result. Consumers for Sustainability highlights the environmental costs of animal-derived materials like wool, leather, and silk\u2014showing how these products consume water, pollute air and soil, and deplete precious land resources. Join us to discover the real costs behind these industries and explore pathways toward more sustainable choices.Speaker\u2019s Bio:Seemanthini C. is the Project Coordinator at Consumers for Sustainability, an initiative dedicated to promoting consumer protection and fostering sustainable practices across sectors. With a background in biotechnology and a wealth of experience in organising educational camps and outreach programs, she is a strong advocate for capacity and community building. She believes these are essential tools for creating a ripple effect that strengthens the sustainability movement and inspires meaningful change.Namrata Bhutoria has been studying the toxic nature of colors - Chromatopia as a topic for long and has been able to successfully offer training and solutions in the form of natural colors. She believes that true learning happens with reflection, connection, and also brings personal transformation. She is passionate about educating young minds on the problems of synthetic color and reviving solutions in natural color application through curriculum and hands-on experiences.",

This multisensory experience, facilitated by Malavika Bhatia and Prithvi Kini of Fungi Foundation, is designed to engage participants with the often-overlooked realm of fungi, emphasising their ecological roles and relationships with other organisms, including humans.The workshop takes participants on a unique fungal adventure, engaging all five senses to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of fungi. By intertwining scientific knowledge with sensory experiences and creative expression, the workshop aims to transform participants' perceptions of fungi from potential disgust to wonder and curiosity.Through a series of interactive stations, participants will explore fungal diversity, examine specimens under microscopes, experience various fungal scents and textures, taste edible mushrooms, and even listen to mushroom-generated music. The workshop culminates in an embodied activity where participants creatively express fungal relationships, fostering a personal connection to these remarkable organisms.Speaker\u2019s Bio:Prithvi Kini is an entrepreneur, yoga practitioner, citizen scientist, and mental health advocate with a deep interest in the therapeutic benefits of mushrooms. As the co-founder of Nuvedo, India's pioneering functional mushroom start-up, her vision is for people to reclaim control of their lives through mushrooms. Through Nuvedo, she forges connections with local farming communities and myriad mycophiles across India and is fostering a mushroom revolution that goes beyond the world of business. With Fungi Foundation India, she's on a mission to revolutionize India's allyship with fungi, not just on a plate but in policy as well. With a commitment to conservation, her interests focus on ethical biodiversity research and Indian ethnomycological exploration.

This multisensory experience, facilitated by Malavika Bhatia and Prithvi Kini of Fungi Foundation, is designed to engage participants with the often-overlooked realm of fungi, emphasising their ecological roles and relationships with other organisms, including humans.The workshop takes participants on a unique fungal adventure, engaging all five senses to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of fungi. By intertwining scientific knowledge with sensory experiences and creative expression, the workshop aims to transform participants' perceptions of fungi from potential disgust to wonder and curiosity.Through a series of interactive stations, participants will explore fungal diversity, examine specimens under microscopes, experience various fungal scents and textures, taste edible mushrooms, and even listen to mushroom-generated music. The workshop culminates in an embodied activity where participants creatively express fungal relationships, fostering a personal connection to these remarkable organisms.Speaker\u2019s Bio:Prithvi Kini is an entrepreneur, yoga practitioner, citizen scientist, and mental health advocate with a deep interest in the therapeutic benefits of mushrooms.

Through Nuvedo, she forges connections with local farming communities and myriad mycophiles across India and is fostering a mushroom revolution that goes beyond the world of business. With Fungi Foundation India, she's on a mission to revolutionize India's allyship with fungi, not just on a plate but in policy as well. With a commitment to conservation, her interests focus on ethical biodiversity research and Indian ethnomycological exploration. Her vision is to create a kinder, authentic and more accepting India through the power of fungi and applying to rekindle a \u2018more-than-human\u2019 outlook on our ways of life.Malavika Bhatia is a forager, artist, and community facilitator who weaves together ethnomycological research, community-based practices, and theoretical frameworks to reimagine relationships in the more-than-human world.

This multisensory experience, facilitated by Malavika Bhatia and Prithvi Kini of Fungi Foundation, is designed to engage participants with the often-overlooked realm of fungi, emphasising their ecological roles and relationships with other organisms, including humans.The workshop takes participants on a unique fungal adventure, engaging all five senses to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of fungi. By intertwining scientific knowledge with sensory experiences and creative expression, the workshop aims to transform participants' perceptions of fungi from potential disgust to wonder and curiosity.Through a series of interactive stations, participants will explore fungal diversity, examine specimens under microscopes, experience various fungal scents and textures, taste edible mushrooms, and even listen to mushroom-generated music. The workshop culminates in an embodied activity where participants creatively express fungal relationships, fostering a personal connection to these remarkable organisms.Speaker\u2019s Bio:Prithvi Kini is an entrepreneur, yoga practitioner, citizen scientist, and mental health advocate with a deep interest in the therapeutic benefits of mushrooms. As the co-founder of Nuvedo, India's pioneering functional mushroom start-up, her vision is for people to reclaim control of their lives through mushrooms. Through Nuvedo, she forges connections with local farming communities and myriad mycophiles across India and is fostering a mushroom revolution that goes beyond the world of business. With Fungi Foundation India, she's on a mission to revolutionize India's allyship with fungi, not just on a plate but in policy as well. With a commitment to conservation, her interests focus on ethical biodiversity research and Indian ethnomycological exploration. Her vision is to create a kinder, authentic and more accepting India through the power of fungi and applying to rekindle a \u2018more-than-human\u2019 outlook on our ways of life.Malavika Bhatia is a forager, artist, and community facilitator who weaves together ethnomycological research, community-based practices, and theoretical frameworks to reimagine relationships in the more-than-human world. Their art practice inhabits spaces of decay and decomposition, viewing these processes not as endpoints but as vital sites of regeneration and possibility. Through programs with Science Gallery Bengaluru, Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, Sandbox Collective, Serendipity Arts Festival, and others, they create participatory experiences that invite audiences to consider how fungal networks can serve as both metaphor and method for reimagining community relationships and ecological entanglements.Community Campaigning: Success Stories and A Pathway to Change\tThe session will be a deep-dive into the importance of engaging with communities for grassroots advocacy initiatives and impactful public mobilization through digital media.

This talk dives into the hidden impacts of our everyday choices and their toll on the environment. From the dyes in our clothing to the materials we often overlook, consumption patterns are driving a crisis. Color Ashram Foundation brings awareness to the toxic dyes used in the fashion industry and the massive waste created as a result. Consumers for Sustainability highlights the environmental costs of animal-derived materials like wool, leather, and silk\u2014showing how these products consume water, pollute air and soil, and deplete precious land resources.

To achieve this, the country has put in place a dedicated policy to carry out afforestation to compensate for the forests it loses to industries and other project developers. However, how well has this panned out on the ground? Forest communities, who had to give up forest lands that they were dependent on to industries years ago, are now being displaced again as the state is struggling for land to meet its afforestation target. Has the role of forests been reduced to only carbon sequestration?\u00a0\u00a0Speaker\u2019s BioKumar Sambhav Shrivastava\u00a0Founder & Director, Land Conflict WatchKumar Sambhav is a social entrepreneur and award-winning journalist, leading innovative research in accountability investigations.

Also on this walk learn more about the Maratha connection to this neighborhood as well as how a philanthropist not only helped renovate the Kadu Malleswara temple but also helped create an entire lake in the days gone by.See how Kadu Malleswara turned into a \"Mall-e-swarm\" and is fast losing not only it's heritage structures but also its local culture. In between all the bytes of history we take bites from an iconic eatery in the this area.So join us on this walk next and get to know Malleswaram in a completely new light.",

The movie is set during the Great Depression and follows Chaplin's iconic character, the Tramp, as he struggles to survive in a rapidly industrializing world.The film opens with the Tramp working on an assembly line at a factory, where he is driven to the brink of madness by the repetitive and dehumanizing nature of the work. He eventually loses his job and ends up in prison, only to be released into a harsh society where unemployment and poverty are widespread.Why should your kid attend this screening? Introduction to Classic Cinema: It\u2019s a great way to introduce children to the history of film, particularly silent films and early cinema. The visual storytelling and Chaplin's physical comedy are timeless and can inspire an appreciation for film artistry.Slapstick Humor: The film\u2019s use of slapstick comedy \u2014 exaggerated physical actions and visual gags \u2014 is entertaining for kids and can help them develop an understanding of humor that transcends language.Social Awareness: The film subtly introduces children to concepts of social justice, equality, and the effects of industrialization on society. It can spark discussions about empathy, the challenges people face, and the importance of fairness.Cultural and Historical Context: Watching Modern Times gives kids a sense of history, particularly the Great Depression, and how it affected people's lives. It can encourage curiosity about the past and promote understanding of how society has evolved.And it's Charlie Chaplin!!!!Don't miss this opportunity to create lasting memories with your family while exposing your kids to the wonders of world cinema.Join us for Family Movie Night \u2013 where the magic of storytelling knows no bounds!Terms and Conditions:The management is not responsible for any injury or damage that may occur during the event.The Event is taking place at Courtyard's indoor Studio space on the second floor.No liability or claims arising from the consumption or intake of any food or drink will be entertained by the management.Parking near the event premises is at the risk of the vehicle owner.Children above the age of 3 need a ticket to attend the event.Valet service is available at a charge of Rs. 200 per vehicle.Photographs and videos of ticket holders may be uploaded to social media.

We also stop at a place connected to India's freedom struggle. After that we pay a quick visit to the silk weavers in the neighborhood.If we still have time we might also pay our respects at the tombs of a few Sufi warriors who were martyred during the III Anglo-Mysore war in 1791.Last but not the least we have breakfast at a legendary food spot.",

Rising to an elevation of 920 meters above sea level, every drop that reaches Bengaluru is part of an awe-inspiring engineering feat, delivering life-giving water across immense distances and elevations.

Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey.

But have you ever wondered what truly fuels this metropolis? Over 100 km away lies its lifeline: the Cauvery River, the single source capable of quenching the city\u2019s vast thirst. Rising to an elevation of 920 meters above sea level, every drop that reaches Bengaluru is part of an awe-inspiring engineering feat, delivering life-giving water across immense distances and elevations. While this feat of human ingenuity is indeed impressive, it underscores a critical reality: the city\u2019s reliance on a distant water source is a fragile solution, one that becomes increasingly unsustainable as demand grows.In this immersive experience on the Apple Vision Pro, transport to the heart of the Cauvery in a way like never before. With stunning 16K 180\u00b0 video narration, stories of conservation and wildlife, you\u2019ll feel the river\u2019s currents as if you\u2019re standing on its banks, surrounded by the beauty of lush landscapes, misty hills, and abundant wildlife. Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey. Watch as dams, pipelines, and pumping stations come to life, illustrating the sophisticated system that transports Cauvery\u2019s finite waters over vast distances to sustain Bengaluru. Feel the river's flow, witness the delicate balance between nature and engineering, and understand both the marvel and the responsibility of relying on a distant water source.An Experience Like No OtherThis is more than just an experience\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to understand the delicate balance that keeps Bengaluru thriving.

    "description": "This event is a part of Bengaluru Hubba, a citywide Arts and Culture fest from Nov 30 - Dec 16Bengaluru\u2014a city of innovation, growth, and resilience, sustaining millions each day. But have you ever wondered what truly fuels this metropolis? Over 100 km away lies its lifeline: the Cauvery River, the single source capable of quenching the city\u2019s vast thirst. Rising to an elevation of 920 meters above sea level, every drop that reaches Bengaluru is part of an awe-inspiring engineering feat, delivering life-giving water across immense distances and elevations. While this feat of human ingenuity is indeed impressive, it underscores a critical reality: the city\u2019s reliance on a distant water source is a fragile solution, one that becomes increasingly unsustainable as demand grows.In this immersive experience on the Apple Vision Pro, transport to the heart of the Cauvery in a way like never before. With stunning 16K 180\u00b0 video narration, stories of conservation and wildlife, you\u2019ll feel the river\u2019s currents as if you\u2019re standing on its banks, surrounded by the beauty of lush landscapes, misty hills, and abundant wildlife. Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey. Watch as dams, pipelines, and pumping stations come to life, illustrating the sophisticated system that transports Cauvery\u2019s finite waters over vast distances to sustain Bengaluru. Feel the river's flow, witness the delicate balance between nature and engineering, and understand both the marvel and the responsibility of relying on a distant water source.An Experience Like No OtherThis is more than just an experience\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to understand the delicate balance that keeps Bengaluru thriving.

While this feat of human ingenuity is indeed impressive, it underscores a critical reality: the city\u2019s reliance on a distant water source is a fragile solution, one that becomes increasingly unsustainable as demand grows.In this immersive experience on the Apple Vision Pro, transport to the heart of the Cauvery in a way like never before. With stunning 16K 180\u00b0 video narration, stories of conservation and wildlife, you\u2019ll feel the river\u2019s currents as if you\u2019re standing on its banks, surrounded by the beauty of lush landscapes, misty hills, and abundant wildlife. Glide along the river and experience the peaceful yet powerful journey of its waters, as they make their way to our city.Dive Deeper with AR and 3D ModelsGet up close with interactive 3D models that reveal the rich wildlife, diverse plants, and the complex infrastructure behind this remarkable journey. Watch as dams, pipelines, and pumping stations come to life, illustrating the sophisticated system that transports Cauvery\u2019s finite waters over vast distances to sustain Bengaluru. Feel the river's flow, witness the delicate balance between nature and engineering, and understand both the marvel and the responsibility of relying on a distant water source.An Experience Like No OtherThis is more than just an experience\u2014it\u2019s an invitation to understand the delicate balance that keeps Bengaluru thriving.

Their primarily vegetarian diet incorporates foraged vegetables, greens, and root crops, with meat consumed sparingly. Traditionally served on large metal platters called ganguwa, this cuisine is nutrient-rich and ideal for enduring cold monsoons.\u00a0\u00a0The five-course menu highlights traditional dishes such as:\u00a0\u00a0Pothithu \u2013 Whole Wheat Pancakes with Honey\u00a0\u00a0- Erigihittu/Sandagai \u2013 Ragi Balls with Garlic Chutney\u00a0\u00a0- Koi Uthukka \u2013 Chicken Curry with Old-Style Bread\u00a0\u00a0- Nilagiri Kurma \u2013 Mixed Vegetable Curry with Old-Style Bread\u00a0\u00a0- Badu Uthukka \u2013 Mutton Curry with Rice\u00a0\u00a0- Avarai Uthukka \u2013 Bean Curry with Rice\u00a0\u00a0Accompaniments include spiced coconut milk as a palate cleanser and digestive items like domba rasa (tomato-garlic rasam) and majjige hittu (little millet in buttermilk). For dessert, indulge in ennaihittu (sweet paniyaram) and hatchikkai (popped millet with coconut milk).\u00a0\u00a0Celebrate this unique culinary journey, blending tradition and family legacy, at Monsoon.",
