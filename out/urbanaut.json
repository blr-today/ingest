Join us on a 'darshan' of the many temples and other religious institutes that dot this area as we narrate to you its origins and about the celebrities/personalities who called it their 'home'. Also on this walk learn more about the Maratha connection to this neighborhood as well as how a philanthropist not only helped renovate the Kadu Malleswara temple but also helped create an entire lake in the days gone by.See how Kadu Malleswara turned into a \"Mall-e-swarm\" and is fast losing not only it's heritage structures but also its local culture. In between all the bytes of history we take bites from an iconic eatery in the this area.So join us on this walk next and get to know Malleswaram in a completely new light.",

    "description": "Smash Guys Burger Residency with BeerThe Smash Guys Burger Residency with Beer marks a thrilling new chapter for The Conservatory, a space that has become a hotspot for culinary innovation over the past two years. We've hosted some of the country\u2019s most exciting chefs and restaurants, recently venturing into international collaborations that have elevated Bengaluru\u2019s dining scene.Now, we\u2019re taking it one step further by introducing a unique residency experience\u2014and who better to kick it off than the Smash Guys? With their expertly crafted burgers and a mission to redefine the city\u2019s burger game, this month-long residency promises to be a delicious adventure you won\u2019t want to miss.Smash Guys is the latest creation from Nikhil and AB Gupta, the culinary masterminds behind The Pizza Bakery and Paris Panini. This time, their mission is bold: to celebrate the art of the burger by bringing the finest styles from across the globe under one roof.After months of meticulously crafting every bite since their smash hit debut at The Conservatory, they\u2019re now ready to take things up a notch with an exciting month-long residency.Smash Guys is here to redefine Bengaluru\u2019s burger scene, filling the flavor void with juicy patties, crisp buns, and creative combinations that promise to thrill every burger lover in town.The dream team behind Smash Guys:\u00a0Chef Guru is the Chef Partner at The Pizza Bakery & Paris Panini. Graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, Australia, his expertise in balancing textures and creating unique sauce combinations brings an unexpected twist to classic burger elements. His commitment to sourcing premium ingredients ensures every component tells its own story while contributing to a harmonious whole.Chef Adithya Kidambi is our friendly neighborhood kombucha scientist. He has built mossant into the best craft kombucha brand in the city, but what few know about him is that he is a trained Chef and self-taught burger scholar who delivered burgers to people during the lockdown post which he sold out at several pop-ups in the city. Adi excels in styles like the Nashville Chicken, Smash Buff/Lamb classics, and Asian-inspired burgers using ingredients like kimchi and miso.Chef Suby is all about chasing the ULTIMATE BURGER DREAM. His obsession with achieving the perfect meat-to-fat ratio and that caramelised crust has led him to experiment with countless grinds and smashing techniques.\u00a0Chef Rohil brings an elegant touch to the veg side of our menu. He completes our trio with his innovative approach to flavour building, and fine-tuning the perfect balance of flavour and texture.Beer on TapTo make this residency even better, The Conservatory will be serving up refreshing beer on tap throughout the month.
