Anthony Svatek | USA | 10 mins 37 secs | English | 2023)A cine-collage manifesto inspired by George Orwell\u2019s essay, with Tilda Swinton narrating. The film uses a blend of images and sound to highlight the common toad as a symbol of natural beauty amidst environmental and political decay. It contrasts the elegance of nature with contemporary issues, urging viewers to reconsider their relationship with the environment and appreciate its beauty and significance.A Flaming Forest (Salman Javeed, Satya Ambasta, Vivek Sangwan | India | 48 mins 27 secs | Kannada, English | 2024)Exclusionary conservation practices in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) Tiger Reserve have displaced Soliga adivasis from the forests they have historically inhabited. The film documents their intimate relationship with the forest, displacement induced loss and resistance against such policies, calling for an alternative vision to conservation.Tomorrow, the Burning Heavens (Max Bloching | Germany | 22 mins 06 secs | German | 2024)This short film explores the 1560s` \u2018Little Ice Age\u2019 and its apocalyptic fears, illustrated in hand-coloured woodblock prints. The film juxtaposes these historical anxieties with modern-day artificial winter landscapes in the Alps, created for skiing resorts. By merging past and present, it examines how image-making, technology, and faith interact amidst environmental crises, reflecting on our evolving perceptions of nature and climate change.Miles Away\u00a0(Megha Acharya | India | 50 mins | Bundeli, Hindi | 2023)The film follows the journey of three women who work at a brick kiln on the outskirts of a city in North India, in the midst of extreme rains and a global pandemic. What unfolds is a story of mobility, debt and the everyday lives of the caste-oppressed women, whose labour is both crucial and too often invisible, in the story of a rapidly urbanising global India.",

The creaking, cracking and rippling is the voice of impermanence. Sound artist Ludwig Berger shows how important it is to listen to the world that surrounds us.

Also on this walk learn more about the Maratha connection to this neighborhood as well as how a philanthropist not only helped renovate the Kadu Malleswara temple but also helped create an entire lake in the days gone by.See how Kadu Malleswara turned into a \"Mall-e-swarm\" and is fast losing not only it's heritage structures but also its local culture. In between all the bytes of history we take bites from an iconic eatery in the this area.So join us on this walk next and get to know Malleswaram in a completely new light.",
