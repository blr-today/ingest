    "description": "Sanjay Divecha is one of the most revered guitar players in India. A unique and compelling voice as a player and composer, he is part of the hugely successful supergroup Cross Currents led by Zakir Hussain and featuring stalwarts such as Dave Holland, Vinnie Colaiuta, Chris Potter, Eddie Daniels, Shankar Mahadevan and Louiz Banks. Through a luminous 35 year long career, Sanjay has worked with artists such as Angelique Kidjo, Carlos Santana, Michael McDonald, Fred Raulston, Dave Weckl, Louis Johnson, Dumazz and Sambaguru among others.He also collaborated with A.R. Rahman on the Danny Boyle movie \u201c127 Hours\u201d that won \u2018Best Original Score\u2019, the OST for the movie \u201cWoman on Top\u201d with Argentinian composer Luis Bacalov, Sanjay also scored for the movie \u2018Leela\u2019 by Somnath Sen which won a Special Jury Award at Toronto Reel World Film Festival.An alumnus (1989) from Musician\u2019s Institute (M.I) in Los Angeles, Sanjay continues to mentor and develop musicians all over the country. His students are not only guitar players, but composers, musicians and singers of all disciplines. Sanjay teaches private lessons and holds workshops to develop musicality and a well rounded aesthetic sensibility in musicians.\u00a0Sanjay Divecha on the music of 'Leela' :As a human being on this planet I\u2019ve always believed in the Oneness of all things in this universe. Going through life's bylanes and observing how events unfold and teach you the lessons to be learned, this belief of Oneness has only strengthened with time.\u00a0My work as an artist has primarily been to connect with my inner self, and express from a place\u00a0of honesty. The yearning to learn something new in my art and refine my skill set has been my constant companion.\u00a0After having written and performed music with various ensembles, I finally mustered up the courage to record a collection of music which was mainly written for solo guitar, and also mainly recorded on acoustic guitar. These songs are reflections of some of my journeys and inspirations, interpreted in a spontaneous and instinctive manner.\u00a0The title 'Leela' refers to the divine Leela - joyous and playful - yet a profound act of creation.\u00a0As I started the recording process I started to add a few layers to enhance the music and some guest artists came on board to\u00a0complete the\u00a0experience which was truly fulfilling for me as an artist. The organic nature of this work takes me back to my formative years as a guitar player and I\u2019m grateful to be sharing this work and for it to take its own journey.\u00a0",

    "description": "As our next pop-up, we bring to you Heirlooms from the Hills by chef Chef Rita Blah\u00a0A nostalgic retelling of Shillong\u2019s Culinary LandscapeMeet Rita: The Home Chef from ShillongBorn and raised in the lush hills of Shillong, Rita\u2019s cooking tells stories of community, memory, and quiet mastery. She learnt by watching \u2014 her grandmother stirring smoky bamboo shoot stews over a wood fire, her mother marinating pork with local spices, neighbours sharing recipes through whispered tips and shared meals.For over 50 years, Rita has cooked \u2014 not for acclaim, but for love. Her kitchen has always been open to family, friends, and the lucky few who get to experience her deeply rooted, intuitively crafted dishes. Her food has travelled quietly from Shillong to Bombay, with chefs from places like The Bombay Canteen and Masque and Naar counting themselves among the fortunate who've tasted it.Rita doesn\u2019t believe in shortcuts. She cooks with memory, community, and soul. Not everyone gets to eat her food \u2014 but those who do never forget it.About the Meal -This meal is a celebration of everyday Khasi flavours \u2014 the kind found in family kitchens, bustling tea shops, and humble canteens across Shillong. Made with ingredients deeply rooted in the land, it features smoked pork slow-dried over a wood fire for up to 24 hours, giving it a rich, earthy depth. Nutty nei iong (black sesame) and fragrant nei leih (round sesame) lend texture and warmth, while sticky rice ties it all together \u2014 simple, grounding, essential.A spoonful of soh iiong, the tart local blackberries, adds a bright, unexpected note \u2014 just like the hills themselves. Eaten on quiet mornings and festive nights alike, this is a meal made from memory, meant to nourish and bring people together.MENU\u00a0\u2728 STARTERS\u00a01.\u2060 \u2060DOH\u00a0THAD | Dried Smoke PorkDescription - A bold and fiery starter featuring pork that's been traditionally smoked over a wood fire for up to 24 hours, then crisp-fried with onions, capsicum and green chillies.

Disconnect from devices for 3 hours of unplugged experience\u2014we'll have books, board games, music, crochet, and of course, food! But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours.",

Bring your own cables and let\u2019s respect each other\u2019s space: leave room in the frequency spectrum, watch your volume, and follow simple non\u2011verbal cues like nods or hand raises to shift the vibe.
