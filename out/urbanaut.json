    "description": "This is our walk in one of the oldest suburbs of the \"old Bangalore\". Join us on a 'darshan' of the many temples and other religious institutes that dot this area as we narrate to you its origins and about the celebrities/personalities who called it their 'home'. Also on this walk learn more about the Maratha connection to this neighborhood as well as how a philanthropist not only helped renovate the Kadu Malleswara temple but also helped create an entire lake in the days gone by.See how Kadu Malleswara turned into a \"Mall-e-swarm\" and is fast losing not only it's heritage structures but also its local culture. In between all the bytes of history we take bites from an iconic eatery in the this area.So join us on this walk next and get to know Malleswaram in a completely new light.",

    "description": "Welcome to the first ever Wellness Day Retreat at the Studio.The intention of this retreat is to help you feel a sense of companionship and clarity in your wellness journey. We want you to feel seen in your struggles, let go of the pressure to \u201crace\u201d towards wellness, explore the feeling that you are not enough and embrace the belief that you are enough, just as you are.Event DescriptionThis half-day retreat is an opportunity to step away from the constant striving and reconnect with a sense of ease, connection, and self-compassion. Over the course of four hours, we\u2019ll create a safe, nurturing space for you to explore one of the most difficult issues we face - why we feel we are not enough, just as we are.This experience will be a digital detox -absolutely no phones for 4 hours (you'll keep them in a basket), as we believe only after a few hours of disconnection from your phone can you reconnect with your body. There will be down-time in the middle of the day to read a book, meet new people or just watch the sunset in solitude from our beautiful, spacious Studio. The half-day retreat will include:\u2022\tA dynamic yoga session\u2022\tA guided meditative experience\u2022\tA therapist-facilitated conversation around 'not enoughness' in a sharing circle\u2022\tA mindful eating experience to connect with yourself and your body including a healthy plant-based meal.   Healthy snacks, herbal tea, detox water and essential oils available throughout the day..   You\u2019ll also have access to our Connection Corner, featuring tools for journaling, introspection, and relaxation, like palo santo, essential oils, and tarot cards.This will be a journey to help you embrace the truth that you are enough, just as you are.Who Is This For? Anyone seeking a compassionate space to explore their wellness journey, connect with like-minded individuals, and feel grounded in their own rhythm.*Details:*\ud83d\udccdLocation: the Studio by Copper+Cloves\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Date & Time: February 2nd, 3pm\u00a0onwards\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f Investment: \u20b93500 plus taxesCome as you are, and leave feeling held, seen, and enough.",
