Marion, a French photographer, and Jack, an American interior designer, plan to spend two days in Paris after a vacation in Venice. Their visit is intended to strengthen their bond, but instead, it exposes the cracks in their relationship.Through witty dialogue and humorous situations, \"2 Days in Paris\" explores themes of love, trust, and the complexities of modern relationships. The film combines the charm of Paris with the raw, unfiltered portrayal of a couple trying to bridge their emotional gaps, ultimately questioning whether their love can withstand the pressures and revelations of their brief stay in the City of Lights.Menu also to be announcedTerms and Conditions:The management is not responsible for any injury or damage that may occur during the event.No liability or claims arising from the consumption or intake of any food or drink will be entertained by the management.Parking near the event premises is at the risk of the vehicle owner.Valet service is available at a charge of Rs. 200 per vehicle.Photographs and videos of ticket holders may be uploaded to social media.
