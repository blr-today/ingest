For us, exploring a new country isn\u2019t complete without a visit to the local grocery stores to discover fresh produce and unique ingredients. Cooking and hosting have always been second nature to us, and as proud Pahadi women, we\u2019ve embarked on a journey to rediscover and preserve the rich culinary heritage of the Garhwal region.For us, food is more than just sustenance\u2014it\u2019s a way to connect, to share, and to bond. Through this pop-up, we want to bring people together to savor authentic Garhwali flavors while immersing in the history, culture, and traditions that make each dish special. It\u2019s not just a meal; it\u2019s a celebration of heritage and a chance to create meaningful memories around the table.We hope to see you soon!\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f- Salomi & Pushkina",

Imagine walking into a busy cafe and seeing not a single phone, no-one taking selfies and no one around you scrolling. Disconnect from devices for 3 hours of unplugged experience\u2014we'll have books, board games, music, crochet, and of course, food! But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones). We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table**Tickets are for entry and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter.
