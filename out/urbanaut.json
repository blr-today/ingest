    "description": "An Interactive play written and performed by Somudranil SarkarAbout the play \"Vrindaban, Present Please\" is an immersive, one-man interactive play set in a rural Indian village, where Samiran Banerjee, a Kolkata teacher, is transferred to a village school after a Supreme Court ruling. Assigned to a chaotic school once led by the mysteriously absent Salma Khatoon, Samiran's efforts to restore order only lead him deeper into unsettling events. From a water shortage to a snake in his room, his attempts to connect with the eccentric villagers only intensify his isolation. But behind it all, Samiran harbors a secret\u2014someone named Vrindaban. Why does he hide this figure? Is it the only refuge in a world that refuses to understand him? The play unravels questions about isolation, hidden truths, and the blurred lines between personal and professional life.About the artist:\u00a0 Somudranil Sarkar, a theatre maker from kolkata. He has over 25 years of experience in theatre and has had the privilege of training under some of the most respected names in the Bengali theatre circuit, including Rudraprasad Sengupta, Swatilekha Sengupta, Debshankar Halder, Sohini Sengupta, and Goutam Halder in Nandikar. He has also trained in mime under the guidance of mime guru Jogesh Dutta. Over the years, he has directed and acted in over 100 plays and curated various theatre workshops for diverse groups.

Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.This support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.The support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours.",

Ya Watchin? screening you shouldn\u2019t miss, it\u2019s a horror film.\u00a0 After hosting several Halloween special screenings, including a special premiere of Longlegs with PVR in Bangalore last year, she\u2019s back with a cult classic this month, Rec (Spanish).\u00a0The special evening includes the screening of this 73-minute nail-biter (with an unpredictable ending \ud83d\udc40) and will be followed by a special performance by DJ Rishi Sippy, with the perfect tunes to boogie the scares away.So show up in your best Halloween costume, enjoy a movie & end your Sunday evening with a dance party! Ladies Who Loiter is a celebration inspired by leisure, love and art. Carefully curated by some incredible women, this is our little love letter to ladies everywhere to add more leisure, lightness, play and art into their lives.\u00a0Boo!

Invite yourself to one \u2014 or three \u2014 or hit us up with ideas and collaborations!REC (2007) is a Spanish found-footage horror film directed by Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Paco Plaza. The story follows TV reporter \u00c1ngela Vidal and her cameraman as they cover a routine night shift at a fire station\u2014until a call to an apartment building turns their night into a nightmare. Shot in real-time with a claustrophobic, handheld style, REC delivers relentless tension and scares across its tight 75-minute runtime. While its intensity may not resonate with everyone, it\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most terrifying found-footage horrors ever made.Rishi Sippy is a Bangalore-based DJ and is the brain behind beloved dance IPs in the city like Jackfruit Dance Party & Freak Opera.

Through breath, sound and movement, you will release held emotions, awaken your Shakti and reclaim the untamed power of your feminine essence. We end this segment with dance and celebration - movement as liberation.Honouring the Feminine Lineage: A sacred ritual to honour the women who came before us - our mothers, grandmothers, and all the feminine energy in our lineage. Through letter writing, invocation and womb blessing, we draw on their strength and wisdom, acknowledging the gifts and burdens we carry forward.Mirror of Shakti: A heart-to-heart connection exercise where women witness each other in truth and grace, remembering that the light we see in another is a reflection of our own.Closing Circle: A gentle integration with grounding breath and reflection.Each woman shares one word of what she\u2019s carrying forward. We close with an invocation to Ma Kali - anchoring gratitude and power into our hearts and wombs.Please wear comfortable clothing and bring yoga mat, scarf/shawl, a journal and pen.Cacao will be served at the beginning of the session.About the Facilitator:Maria is a Reiki Master and psychic healer, weaving 9 years of energy work into transformational spaces for emotional, spiritual and psychological healing.
