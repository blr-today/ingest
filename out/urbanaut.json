The pieces presented are learned from Kalamandalam Chandrika, a direct disciple of Chinnammu Amma, and are carried through the embodied memories of two women dancers.Rooted in tradition yet deeply personal, this performance honors a forgotten lineage in Mohiniyattam. It brings visibility to Chinnammu Amma\u2019s legacy while also acknowledging the continued influence of Amith\u2019s teachers, Nirmala Paniker and Kalamandalam Chandrika. Through this recital, Amith opens a space to reflect on the form\u2019s history, memory, and transmission.Vocal: Rohith AneeshNattuvangam: Sreenima N P.Amith K.Amith K is a scholar, dancer, and choreographer with a PhD from Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady.

    "description": "Samyoga \u2013 Khayal Se Kriti TakA unique confluence of Hindustani and Carnatic musical traditionsSamyoga \u2013 meaning union or coming together \u2013 is an evocative musical production that intricately weaves together the rich threads of India\u2019s two great classical traditions: Hindustani and Carnatic music. Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), Samyoga is a celebration of both the shared roots and the distinctive aesthetics of these traditions. This presentation of Samyoga will be an unplugged, voice-only exploration, where two voices come together, accompanied by live tanpuras to create an immersive and meditative musical experience.Traversing the expanse of Indian music, the concert explores genres ranging from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotional depth of Bhakti Sangeet, and from the emotive beauty of Thumri and Jawali to the dramatic expressiveness of Natyasangeet. Each piece is carefully curated to highlight both the convergence and divergence in approach, structure, and emotion across the two systems.Through a seamless blend of performance and narration, Samyoga offers audiences more than just a concert\u2014it presents a musical journey, providing insights into the evolution, nuances, and interconnections between genres.\u00a0Interestingly, both Radhika and Manasi are alumni of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who chose to follow their hearts into the world of music. Today, they are recognised not only as accomplished performers but also as dedicated researchers in the field of Indian music.\u00a0",

    "description": "INDIGO TIE AND DYE WORKSHOPAn immersive, hands-on session for FamiliesUncover the timeless magic of indigo in this immersive, hands-on workshop that blends art, craft, culture, and sustainability. Indigo is more than just a color - it's a centuries-old dye with deep roots in textile traditions from India, Japan, Africa, and beyond. Known for its rich, deep blue hues, indigo has been used to tell stories, mark identities, and dye fabrics in both everyday life and ceremonial settings.When: Saturday, 9 August, 11 am onwardsWhere: Ambara Store, BangaloreAge group: 10 and aboveIn this workshop, participants will be introduced to the natural indigo dyeing process, understanding how leaves from the indigofera plant are transformed into a vibrant blue pigment through fermentation and oxidation. You'll learn how traditional indigo vats are prepared and witness the magical moment when fabric pulled from the dye appears green and then slowly turns blue before your eyes - a fascinating chemical transformation that's as meditative as it is beautiful.The experience will guide you through various shibori-inspired tie-dye techniques - folding, binding, stitching, clamping, and knotting - to resist dye and create striking, organic patterns. Whether you prefer structured designs or free-flowing experimentation, you\u2019ll have the space and guidance to express your creativity.What to expect:A brief history and cultural background of indigo across different culturesAn introduction to natural dyeing and sustainable textile practicesBrief explanation on preparing and maintaining an indigo vatHands-on experimentation with tie-dye techniquesMindful, sensory engagement with fabric, color, and processThe joy of slow making and crafting something uniquely your ownSuitable for all ages and experience levels, the workshop is a fun, creative, and sensory-rich experience suitable for all skill levels. It is a wonderful way to reconnect with traditional crafts, engage in a tactile learning experience, and walk away with your own hand-dyed bandana.",

    "description": "Welcome to Coro Commons!A new kind of community gathering. A slower kind of bazaar.Coro Commons is our way of opening up the Coro spirit to everyone with a vibrant, one-day gathering where stalls, stories, and shared experiences come together under one roof. While it may look like a market, it\u2019s more than that. This is a space to create, connect, and be, with hands-on experiences for both kids and adults, playful interactions, creative expressions, and yes, some beautiful things to take home too.We\u2019re thrilled to be hosting Merchants of Happiness - India\u2019s first-ever child-led pop-up - built on the belief that children are not just the future, but the present. Over the past two years, MOH has worked with over 600 children across schools and NGOs, co-creating joyful, inclusive spaces where children aged 7 to 21 lead their own stalls, offering everything from food and books to pre-loved toys, DIY stations, and delightful performances.Though Coro is a space that celebrates parents and families, Coro Commons is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re coming with a little one in tow, on your own, or with a friend, you\u2019ll find something that sparks joy, curiosity, or a new connection. And in the spirit of truly welcoming families, all kids walk in free - no age limits, no exceptions.We\u2019re not here to sell stuff. We\u2019re here to gather with purpose\u2014to make space for mess, meaning, and a little magic.This isn\u2019t just a bazaar. This is Coro Commons. Let\u2019s gather differently.At Coro, we also care deeply about sustainability. In that spirit, we gently encourage you to take public transport where possible. While we don\u2019t have dedicated parking, there\u2019s ample space to park on the street if you choose to drive in.",
