These two chefs, now at the forefront of the Goan food scene, have been inseparable since childhood, sharing a bond forged in the vibrant streets of Panjim.This special dinner menu is an ode to their enduring friendship and the city that has been its backdrop. The dishes showcase the European techniques they've mastered throughout their culinary journeys. The fusion of Portuguese and local influences that define Goan cuisine is beautifully reflected in every bite, each with a contemporary twist that only these talented chefs can create.Throughout the evening, embark on a culinary journey that feels both modern and nostalgic. The menu draws inspiration from generations-old recipe books of the Gomes Pereira and Prazeres households, infusing the meal with the essence of Goa's rich history.Experience the magic as these two friends take contemporary Goan cuisine in a new direction, delivering a heartwarming and memorable dining experience that pays tribute to their shared roots and innovative spirit.Set MenuNOTE: Seafood allergies & gluten can be accommodatedNon- Veg Menu\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bread Course:Coriander Chilli Lime/Goan Sausage ButterCourse 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OLMI\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grilled morels & truffle.Course 2:GRILLED TIGER PRAWNSRecheado seafood bisqueCourse 3:ROAST BEEF CROQUETTASGarlic paprika yoghurtCourse 4:PAN ROASTED FISHKalchi kodi, turmeric mash, onion fennel saladCourse 5:BEEF TENDERLIONOnion sauce, pepper jus, pomme frittesCOURSE 6:PASTEIS DE NATAPortuguese custard tartVeg Menu\u00a0\u00a0Bread Course:Coriander Chilli LimeCourse 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OLMI\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grilled morels & truffleCourse 2:\u00a0GRILLED BROCCOLIGarlic butter & dill yoghurtCourse 3:JACKFRUIT CROQUETTASGarlic paprika yoghurtCourse 4:GRILLED WHITE ASPARAGUS\u00a0& PALM HEARTKalchi kodi, turmeric mash, puffed brown riceCourse 5:TAMBDI BHAJI LASAGNAparmesan , goats cheese, caramelised walnutsCourse 6:PASTEIS DE NATAPortuguese custard tartTerms and Conditions : The management is not responsible for any injury or damage that may occur during an eventDo not purchase tickets from anyone other than on the ticketing platform.No-shows and cancellations are non-refundable by all means.Tickets are non-transferable and are for personal use only.Children aged 7 and above require a ticket to attend the meal.
