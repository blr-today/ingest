Assigned to a chaotic school once led by the mysteriously absent Salma Khatoon, Samiran's efforts to restore order only lead him deeper into unsettling events. From a water shortage to a snake in his room, his attempts to connect with the eccentric villagers only intensify his isolation. But behind it all, Samiran harbors a secret\u2014someone named Vrindaban. Why does he hide this figure? Is it the only refuge in a world that refuses to understand him? The play unravels questions about isolation, hidden truths, and the blurred lines between personal and professional life.About the artist:\u00a0 Somudranil Sarkar, a theatre maker from kolkata. He has over 25 years of experience in theatre and has had the privilege of training under some of the most respected names in the Bengali theatre circuit, including Rudraprasad Sengupta, Swatilekha Sengupta, Debshankar Halder, Sohini Sengupta, and Goutam Halder in Nandikar.

Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.This support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.The support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

    "description": "Beyond and within the familiar confines of our home, a vibrant, bustling ecosystem thrives, often unnoticed, but always present. This book is an exploration of that hidden world, a journey into the lives of the animals, birds and insects that share our dwellings and the spaces immediately surrounding them. Some are beneficial, acting as natural pest control, while others can be perceived as nuisances, challenging our sense of control and cleanliness. Yet, they all contribute to the rich tapestry of life that surrounds us, each with wonderous stories of survival, adaptation, and interaction.This book aims to illuminate these often-overlooked, invisible housemates, to bridge the gap between our human-centric perspective and the fascinating world they occupy. I delve into the natural history of 13 amazing creatures, exploring their behaviours, life cycles, and ecological roles. I examine the intricate relationships they have with each other and with us, the humans who share their space. How do our actions, our habits, and the very architecture of our homes influence their lives? How do they, in turn, impact our own? After reading this book, I hope that readers can develop a more appreciative eye for these marvellous creatures, even the ones that incite fear, gain a richer understanding of the natural world and our place within it.",

    "name": "Awakening : Freedom From Suffering",
    "description": "Awakening\u00a0has been the basis of most of the ancient practices and texts, like Yoga or Zen. In Ancient times, It was the most obvious process to aspire for. Somehow in the modern times, it has been either mystified and shown as an extraordinary thing (limited to a few people) or something which is taken as a myth and not real. In this gathering, we will explore \"Awakening\" from all perspectives. We will unwrap the wrappers of religion and spirituality and go to the core of Awakening.\u200bWe will also discuss if there is a path to awakening or is it pathless.\u200bThis session will definitely show you a way towards liberation from suffering.\u200b\u00a0This is also an AMA with Ashwin about Awakening.\u200bThe event joining fee is Rs.. 499 only. Collected mainly to make this event sustainable and self-sufficient.\u200bIn case you can\u2019t afford it and still want to join, pls message us and we will give you a scholarship.\u200bAbout the Guide:\u200bAshwin writes and speaks about breaking free from the shackles of suffering that arise from our identification with the psychological self. He points to the recognition of our natural state, which is inherently peaceful and joyful, and available to everyone. His own journey has been one of intense suffering and eventual freedom. Along the way, he encountered many great teachers, but more importantly, he undertook numerous silent sabbaticals, deep inquiries, and personal experiments to discover the truth through direct experience.",

E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter.
