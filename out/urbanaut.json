During a session, the participant typically lies down in a relaxed state while the practitioner plays the instruments in a rhythmic and intentional manner. The sounds are often rhythmic and repetitive, inducing a meditative or trance-like state that allows the participant to journey inward. This altered state of consciousness is where healing is said to occur, as the sounds help to align the mind, body, and spirit.",
