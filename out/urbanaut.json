Join us on a 'darshan' of the many temples and other religious institutes that dot this area as we narrate to you its origins and about the celebrities/personalities who called it their 'home'. Also on this walk learn more about the Maratha connection to this neighborhood as well as how a philanthropist not only helped renovate the Kadu Malleswara temple but also helped create an entire lake in the days gone by.See how Kadu Malleswara turned into a \"Mall-e-swarm\" and is fast losing not only it's heritage structures but also its local culture. In between all the bytes of history we take bites from an iconic eatery in the this area.So join us on this walk next and get to know Malleswaram in a completely new light.",

He has built mossant into the best craft kombucha brand in the city, but what few know about him is that he is a trained Chef and self-taught burger scholar who delivered burgers to people during the lockdown post which he sold out at several pop-ups in the city. Adi excels in styles like the Nashville Chicken, Smash Buff/Lamb classics, and Asian-inspired burgers using ingredients like kimchi and miso.Chef Suby is all about chasing the ULTIMATE BURGER DREAM. His obsession with achieving the perfect meat-to-fat ratio and that caramelised crust has led him to experiment with countless grinds and smashing techniques.\u00a0Chef Rohil brings an elegant touch to the veg side of our menu.
