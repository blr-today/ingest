The pieces presented are learned from Kalamandalam Chandrika, a direct disciple of Chinnammu Amma, and are carried through the embodied memories of two women dancers.Rooted in tradition yet deeply personal, this performance honors a forgotten lineage in Mohiniyattam. It brings visibility to Chinnammu Amma\u2019s legacy while also acknowledging the continued influence of Amith\u2019s teachers, Nirmala Paniker and Kalamandalam Chandrika. Through this recital, Amith opens a space to reflect on the form\u2019s history, memory, and transmission.Vocal: Rohith AneeshNattuvangam: Sreenima N P.Amith K.Amith K is a scholar, dancer, and choreographer with a PhD from Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. His work explores the intersections of caste, culture, and history in modern Kerala, with writings on gender, dance, and society. Through Mohiniyattam, he challenges hierarchies within the art world, blending scholarship and performance.",

Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), Samyoga is a celebration of both the shared roots and the distinctive aesthetics of these traditions. This presentation of Samyoga will be an unplugged, voice-only exploration, where two voices come together, accompanied by live tanpuras to create an immersive and meditative musical experience.Traversing the expanse of Indian music, the concert explores genres ranging from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotional depth of Bhakti Sangeet, and from the emotive beauty of Thumri and Jawali to the dramatic expressiveness of Natyasangeet. Each piece is carefully curated to highlight both the convergence and divergence in approach, structure, and emotion across the two systems.Through a seamless blend of performance and narration, Samyoga offers audiences more than just a concert\u2014it presents a musical journey, providing insights into the evolution, nuances, and interconnections between genres.\u00a0Interestingly, both Radhika and Manasi are alumni of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who chose to follow their hearts into the world of music. Today, they are recognised not only as accomplished performers but also as dedicated researchers in the field of Indian music.\u00a0",

Disconnect from devices for 3 hours of unplugged experience\u2014we'll have books, board games, music, crochet, and of course, food! But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours!",

    "description": "INDIGO TIE AND DYE WORKSHOPAn immersive, hands-on session for FamiliesUncover the timeless magic of indigo in this immersive, hands-on workshop that blends art, craft, culture, and sustainability. Indigo is more than just a color - it's a centuries-old dye with deep roots in textile traditions from India, Japan, Africa, and beyond. Known for its rich, deep blue hues, indigo has been used to tell stories, mark identities, and dye fabrics in both everyday life and ceremonial settings.When: Saturday, 9 August, 11 am onwardsWhere: Ambara Store, BangaloreAge group: 10 and aboveIn this workshop, participants will be introduced to the natural indigo dyeing process, understanding how leaves from the indigofera plant are transformed into a vibrant blue pigment through fermentation and oxidation. You'll learn how traditional indigo vats are prepared and witness the magical moment when fabric pulled from the dye appears green and then slowly turns blue before your eyes - a fascinating chemical transformation that's as meditative as it is beautiful.The experience will guide you through various shibori-inspired tie-dye techniques - folding, binding, stitching, clamping, and knotting - to resist dye and create striking, organic patterns. Whether you prefer structured designs or free-flowing experimentation, you\u2019ll have the space and guidance to express your creativity.What to expect:A brief history and cultural background of indigo across different culturesAn introduction to natural dyeing and sustainable textile practicesBrief explanation on preparing and maintaining an indigo vatHands-on experimentation with tie-dye techniquesMindful, sensory engagement with fabric, color, and processThe joy of slow making and crafting something uniquely your ownSuitable for all ages and experience levels, the workshop is a fun, creative, and sensory-rich experience suitable for all skill levels. It is a wonderful way to reconnect with traditional crafts, engage in a tactile learning experience, and walk away with your own hand-dyed bandana.",
