It\u2019s something more. A gathering where strangers come together to write, not to people they know, but to someone they\u2019ve just met. Through gentle prompts, you\u2019ll write reflections, memories, questions or thoughts you didn\u2019t know needed saying. And somewhere in the silence, something shifts.It is a 2 hour guided experience that includes:Guided writing circle with thoughtful prompts. No pressure, just presenceTime to read or exchange letters with fellow participantsA warm, analogue space \u2014 no digital distractions, just pen, paper, and presenceWhy AttendA space to slow down and reconnect with yourselfAn opportunity to express without judgment or performanceA meaningful way to meet others through shared reflectionWhether you're an introvert, a deep feeler, or simply curious, come as you are. Write what you didn\u2019t know you needed to say. Leave with something you didn\u2019t expect to find.",

Imagine walking into a busy cafe and seeing not a single phone, no one taking selfies, and no one around you scrolling. Disconnect from devices for 3 hours of unplugged experience\u2014we'll have books, board games, music, crochet, and of course, food! But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter! Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones). We will not be using our phones for social media during the event; instead, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, iPads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours.",

It\u2019s a practice of presence, patience, and surrender\u2014a balance to the fast pace of daily life.This workshop is perfect for anyone curious about slowing down, cultivating resilience, and discovering how stillness can be as transformative as movement. \ud83c\udf19About the teacher: Yashaswini is a yoga teacher trained in Hatha, Vinyasa, Yin, Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga, Aerial Yoga, and Sound Meditation.

    "description": "Women have a complicated relationship with money.And it starts early.Many families shield their daughters from anything related to \u2018finance\u2019, but this well-meaning protection ends up being a disservice. When these young women step into the real world, they lack the confidence to make financial decisions -\u00a0not because they\u2019re incapable, but because they were never given information on budgeting, savings, and investments.Later in life, many continue to rely on their partners for investment decisions. This dependency on others will only stop when they have the right information and toolkit to take back control.That\u2019s where we come in.After two 'In Her Interest' pilots, we've realised what women need is a safe, private space to talk money - where no question is too small or too basic.In our 5th In Her Interest session on September 20th in Bangalore, we will focus on two topics:How to create and build passive income and how to save for your retirement.The session is at the Samagata Foundation, on St. Mark's Road, Bangalore.Sushmitha Shetty - Home maker and trader who makes 60k as passive incomeDr. Sagneet Kaur - Financial Behaviour Scientist, PGIM - Asset Management, with a focus on retirement.The key areas we cover are:The foundations of incomeWhy passive income matters, especially for women?Case study of a personal story on how the speaker built and grew passive income.How to start looking for passive income?How can your hobby make money and drive financial freedom?How can your social network help you earn?Starting small, the importance of consistency, and how to scale.How to achieve a happy and fulfilling retirement?Worksheets to get you started on both topicsSession goalsSimplify money conceptsBust common financial mythsBuild your confidence in making financial decisionsNo jargon, just real talk.Note: Each session is theme-based. This session is about 'Creating and Building Passive Income and Saving for Retirement' - we are not talking stocks and shares.",

No expectations, no judgment\u2014just a gentle space to reflect, share, and listen.We\u2019re excited to introduce Sober Sanctuary\u2014a regular meetup for those on the sober journey, designed to be more intimate and intentional. While we\u2019re committed to curating larger sober events that are lively and fun, Sober Sanctuary offers something different: a quieter space to connect with like-minded people, build community, and explore what life beyond alcohol can look like.Each session invites you to slow down, share experiences, and spend time in quiet reflection, while also exploring the small shifts in daily habits that can spark lasting change. You\u2019ll be joined by Sarah, a certified habits and lifestyle coach, who will help guide the flow and hold space for meaningful conversations.*This isn\u2019t a formal or structured rehab program, but rather a welcoming circle where you can listen, reflect, and grow alongside others. Whether you\u2019re sober, sober curious, or simply looking for deeper, more intentional connections, you\u2019ll find a supportive home here.",
