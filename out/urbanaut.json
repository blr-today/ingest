The pieces presented are learned from Kalamandalam Chandrika, a direct disciple of Chinnammu Amma, and are carried through the embodied memories of two women dancers.Rooted in tradition yet deeply personal, this performance honors a forgotten lineage in Mohiniyattam. It brings visibility to Chinnammu Amma\u2019s legacy while also acknowledging the continued influence of Amith\u2019s teachers, Nirmala Paniker and Kalamandalam Chandrika. Through this recital, Amith opens a space to reflect on the form\u2019s history, memory, and transmission.Vocal: Rohith AneeshNattuvangam: Sreenima N P.Amith K.Amith K is a scholar, dancer, and choreographer with a PhD from Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. His work explores the intersections of caste, culture, and history in modern Kerala, with writings on gender, dance, and society. Through Mohiniyattam, he challenges hierarchies within the art world, blending scholarship and performance.",

    "description": "Samyoga \u2013 Khayal Se Kriti TakA unique confluence of Hindustani and Carnatic musical traditionsSamyoga \u2013 meaning union or coming together \u2013 is an evocative musical production that intricately weaves together the rich threads of India\u2019s two great classical traditions: Hindustani and Carnatic music. Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), Samyoga is a celebration of both the shared roots and the distinctive aesthetics of these traditions. This presentation of Samyoga will be an unplugged, voice-only exploration, where two voices come together, accompanied by live tanpuras to create an immersive and meditative musical experience.Traversing the expanse of Indian music, the concert explores genres ranging from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotional depth of Bhakti Sangeet, and from the emotive beauty of Thumri and Jawali to the dramatic expressiveness of Natyasangeet. Each piece is carefully curated to highlight both the convergence and divergence in approach, structure, and emotion across the two systems.Through a seamless blend of performance and narration, Samyoga offers audiences more than just a concert\u2014it presents a musical journey, providing insights into the evolution, nuances, and interconnections between genres.\u00a0Interestingly, both Radhika and Manasi are alumni of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who chose to follow their hearts into the world of music. Today, they are recognised not only as accomplished performers but also as dedicated researchers in the field of Indian music.\u00a0",

    "description": "At different points in life, we often feel pulled in many directions.The desire for freedom and independence.The longing to belong and connect.The quiet inner nudge to grow, shift, or heal.In this reflective Zuva Life experience, guided by master practitioner Ragini Rao (Infinum Growth), we\u2019ll gently explore these three lifelong forces\u2014Autonomy, Homonomy, and Physis\u2014through Transactional Analysis.Ragini Rao is a Teaching and Supervising Transactional Analyst TSTA(P). She trains and supervises advanced training groups in Transactional Analysis to become Psychotherapists, Coaches and Trainers. With over 5000 hours of one-on-one and group counselling and therapy, over a span of 30 years, she has addressed problems pertaining to Relationships, Marital Issues, Depression, Grief, Low Self Esteem and Sexual, Verbal and Physical Abuse. Ragini is also a licensed workshop leader for the \u201cHeal your Life\u201d programs based on the philosophy of world renowned author Louise L. Hay. She conducts the Heal Your Life workshops in offline settings.Expect a mix of personal reflection, creative expression, group conversations, and playful tools that help you notice:When do I crave independence?Where do I feel most connected to others?What parts of me are ready to grow or change?This isn\u2019t about fixing or solving anything. It\u2019s about pausing, noticing, and gently mapping your own \u201ctug of three.\u201dNo prior experience with Transactional Analysis needed\u2014just bring your curiosity.",

No big reveal.We head toward a hidden speakeasy, a tucked-away dream of surreal art, shared plates, and first drinks on us.Think hidden doors, dreamy cocktails, and stories that unfold over Burmese plates. Just a slow circle of strangers turning into something more. If you know, you\u2019ll feel it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll want to.Picture this :\ud83c\udf75 Caf\u00e9 whispers\ud83c\udfa8 Hidden doors\ud83c\udf78 Dreamy cocktails\ud83e\udd62 Burmese bites\ud83c\udf00 And strangers who won\u2019t stay strangers for longThis is not just an event. It\u2019s an unfolding. A step into what travel could feel like, offline, unscripted, unforgettable. This isn\u2019t a party \u2014 it\u2019s a portal.",

    "description": "Just as we leave our footprints on its paths, the city where we live leaves an imprint on us. Its spaces shape our experience; its sights and sounds surround us; its food fuels us to keep going; its traffic stalls us in our tracks. In this generative writing workshop, participants are invited to map their unique experiences of life in Bengaluru through poetry. We\u2019ll read place-poems to consider various approaches to writing about the city, and engage in a series of activities to reflect on history and lore, memory, sensory experience, landscape, language, and the ways that our city has changed over time. Through guided writing exercises, mapmaking, reading, discussion, and recitation, we\u2019ll explore the many ways we interact with Bengaluru, writing to collectively remember and reimagine what our city means to us.This workshop is part of Luru Magazine's issue 02 launch at Sabha.About the facilitator:Devi Sastry (she/her) is a writer, teacher, and editor from Bengaluru. Her life and her work revolve around food, family, and multilingualism. She holds an MFA in poetry from New York University, and she has taught creative and critical writing at NYU and Montclair State University. Her writing has been published or is forthcoming in\u00a0Wasafiri, dhoop magazine, Poetry Northwest, Honey literary, and Bengaluru Review, among other publications.

But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours!",
