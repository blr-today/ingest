    "description": "Samyoga \u2013 Khayal Se Kriti TakA unique confluence of Hindustani and Carnatic musical traditionsSamyoga \u2013 meaning union or coming together \u2013 is an evocative musical production that intricately weaves together the rich threads of India\u2019s two great classical traditions: Hindustani and Carnatic music. Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), Samyoga is a celebration of both the shared roots and the distinctive aesthetics of these traditions. This presentation of Samyoga will be an unplugged, voice-only exploration, where two voices come together, accompanied by live tanpuras to create an immersive and meditative musical experience.Traversing the expanse of Indian music, the concert explores genres ranging from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotional depth of Bhakti Sangeet, and from the emotive beauty of Thumri and Jawali to the dramatic expressiveness of Natyasangeet. Each piece is carefully curated to highlight both the convergence and divergence in approach, structure, and emotion across the two systems.Through a seamless blend of performance and narration, Samyoga offers audiences more than just a concert\u2014it presents a musical journey, providing insights into the evolution, nuances, and interconnections between genres.\u00a0Interestingly, both Radhika and Manasi are alumni of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who chose to follow their hearts into the world of music. Today, they are recognised not only as accomplished performers but also as dedicated researchers in the field of Indian music.\u00a0",

Disconnect from devices for 3 hours of unplugged experience\u2014we'll have books, board games, music, crochet, and of course, food! But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation.This time, Doors, a homegrown social card game, will be featured! The game is designed to bring people together and enable meaningful conversation through play. Created as a response to our hyper-digital lives, it invites you to slow down and explore thoughtful questions, big ideas, and wholesome human connections. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter! Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones). We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event; we will only take photos with a camera. Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours!",

    "description": "Welcome to Coro Commons!A new kind of community gathering. A slower kind of bazaar.Coro Commons is our way of opening up the Coro spirit to everyone with a vibrant, one-day gathering where stalls, stories, and shared experiences come together under one roof. While it may look like a market, it\u2019s more than that. This is a space to create, connect, and be, with hands-on experiences for both kids and adults, playful interactions, creative expressions, and yes, some beautiful things to take home too.We\u2019re thrilled to be hosting Merchants of Happiness - India\u2019s first-ever child-led pop-up - built on the belief that children are not just the future, but the present. Over the past two years, MOH has worked with over 600 children across schools and NGOs, co-creating joyful, inclusive spaces where children aged 7 to 21 lead their own stalls, offering everything from food and books to pre-loved toys, DIY stations, and delightful performances.Though Coro is a space that celebrates parents and families, Coro Commons is for everyone. Whether you\u2019re coming with a little one in tow, on your own, or with a friend, you\u2019ll find something that sparks joy, curiosity, or a new connection. And in the spirit of truly welcoming families, all kids walk in free - no age limits, no exceptions.We\u2019re not here to sell stuff. We\u2019re here to gather with purpose\u2014to make space for mess, meaning, and a little magic.This isn\u2019t just a bazaar. This is Coro Commons. Let\u2019s gather differently.At Coro, we also care deeply about sustainability. In that spirit, we gently encourage you to take public transport where possible. While we don\u2019t have dedicated parking, there\u2019s ample space to park on the street if you choose to drive in.",

Join us for a gathering where sound becomes memory, and memory becomes a quest.",
