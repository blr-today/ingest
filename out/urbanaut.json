The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter! Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones). We will not be using our phones for social media during the event; instead, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, iPads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours.",

Email us at sillyhands.shibari@gmail.comWelcome to Queer Cuddle Salon!Silly Hands Shibari is hosting an evening for LGBTQIA+ folks to pause, rest and gently explore platonic or sensual intimacy in an affirming space. We\u2019re opening this space to take a break from the burning world, chronic pain and life in general to engage in consensual touching, cuddles and soft kink\u2026and ofcourse, to let people eat cake.\u00a0Our cozy little house is open all evening for you to drop by, meet and relax amongst other queer people. There will be dedicated areas for cuddling and enjoying touch. You can give or get a massage. Engage in soft, slow kink (think biting, playing footsie, rope play, sensory play, etc) Or you can sit and watch. Draw or colour. No pressure. At all. The Kitchen is reserved for water breaks, coffee, tea and snacks, to chat. It is a no-play zone and free from h*rny vibes.And for the first time, we\u2019re exploring a concept called \u201cSweet Carolina\u201d, a human platter centerpiece aka YOU. What does that mean?For the adventurous, exhibitionist folks, an optional \u201cliving platter\u201d table invites volunteers (opt-in only) to recline on the dining table and be decorated with cake, fruit, candy or syrup that is artfully placed for others to graze, eat from. All our events hold consent at the top of our practice and will continue to be our responsibility as facilitator and yours as an attendee to negotiate your terms before engaging. This is not a s*x or a play party but a playful community event at the intersection of queerness & kink. We\u2019re not allowing n*dity or g3nital play. Every ticket allows you + one buddy to attend the event. (You can bring you may bring a friend, partner, or chosen family member)More Info:The doors open at 5 pm sharp and stays open until 8 pm. Entry will not be allowed post 8 pm.At 5:30 we will have a round of introductions to those who are new to the space and others. As well as the rules, space and event.\u00a0What to Bring:Yourself, Your BuddyA pair of comfy clothes to change into.Fav. Blanket A towel, if things get messy.Dress Code: Soft and Cozy (Loungewear, Leggings, Pajamas, Boxers, Hoodies\u2026)",

    "description": "Women have a complicated relationship with money.And it starts early.Many families shield their daughters from anything related to \u2018finance\u2019, but this well-meaning protection ends up being a disservice. When these young women step into the real world, they lack the confidence to make financial decisions -\u00a0not because they\u2019re incapable, but because they were never given information on budgeting, savings, and investments.Later in life, many continue to rely on their partners for investment decisions. This dependency on others will only stop when they have the right information and toolkit to take back control.That\u2019s where we come in.After two 'In Her Interest' pilots, we've realised what women need is a safe, private space to talk money - where no question is too small or too basic.In our 5th In Her Interest session on September 20th in Bangalore, we will focus on two topics:How to create and build passive income and how to save for your retirement.The session is at the Samagata Foundation, on St. Mark's Road, Bangalore.Sushmitha Shetty - Home maker and trader who makes 60k as passive incomeDr. Sagneet Kaur - Financial Behaviour Scientist, PGIM - Asset Management, with a focus on retirement.The key areas we cover are:The foundations of incomeWhy passive income matters, especially for women?Case study of a personal story on how the speaker built and grew passive income.How to start looking for passive income?How can your hobby make money and drive financial freedom?How can your social network help you earn?Starting small, the importance of consistency, and how to scale.How to achieve a happy and fulfilling retirement?Worksheets to get you started on both topicsSession goalsSimplify money conceptsBust common financial mythsBuild your confidence in making financial decisionsNo jargon, just real talk.Note: Each session is theme-based. This session is about 'Creating and Building Passive Income and Saving for Retirement' - we are not talking stocks and shares.",

This one\u2019s special: part lecture, part workshop on visual thinking. Kaustubh will show how doodling and drawing can transform into tools for clarity, creativity, and sharper articulation, and even help ideas stick in memory for longer. All of this, over Geist beer on tap at Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar.What to Expect:A 60-minute lecture-workshop on visual thinking and its everyday applications15\u201320 minutes of interactive Q&AOne Geist beer on tap included with your ticketA lively mixer to share what you drew, see how others mapped their insights, and take home a new perspectiveThis isn\u2019t an art class or a drawing workshop. Through Kaustubh\u2019s lived experience, we\u2019ll explore the science of visual thinking and its real-world uses: from mind maps and graphs to teaching tools and even investor pitch decks. All in the chill vibe of a pub lecture, over a drink and some grub.Event Details:\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, 21st September | 4 PM \u2013 6 PM\ud83d\udccd Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar\ud83c\udfab Limited to 60 attendees only\ud83d\udcb0 Early bird pricing available for the first 10 ticketsAbout the LecturerKaustubh Khare believes that everyone can draw and that drawing is less about talent and more about how we think. His lecture-workshops transform doodling into a powerful tool for clarity, creativity, and collaboration. He has worked with governments, universities, startups, and nonprofits on diverse projects, including designing visual pedagogical tools now used by over half a million government school teachers in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. A graduate of IIT Kharagpur, Ashoka University, and the University of Tartu, he is currently exploring how India's heritage can be brought alive through visual storytelling.About Pint of ViewInspired by the successful Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., Pint of View brings this format to India for the first time. It\u2019s where big ideas meet bar tables, and where you enjoy a drink in hand, walking out with a new way of seeing the world.Book now & develop your own pint of view! \ud83c\udf7b",
