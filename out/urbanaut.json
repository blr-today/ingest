    "description": "Madhuragati - Every step in Odissi resounds with the sweetness of a cultural aesthetic formed over centuries of aspiration for a higher goal.. To celebrate the beauty of this exquisite dance form arising from the life and beliefs of the people of forgone times till now.\u00a0Anoushka will perform dance works that showcase a range of possibilities highlighting the sculptural and expressive qualities of the Odissi style.The performance features pieces that are seamlessly connected by brief introductory interludes. This carefully crafted format offers an engaging experience for the audience, guiding them through the beauty of the Odissi classical dance form. Originally a sacred ritual dedicated to the gods, Odissi is one of the oldest dance traditions in the world. Odissi speaks of love and union, between the human and divine, transporting viewers to enchanted worlds of magic and spirituality. Its sensuous and lyrical grace reflects both the motifs of Odisha temple sculpture as well as the poetry from the deep wellsprings of Odia music.Anoushka Rahman, disciple of Guru Surupa Sen, is the new soloist and emerging star of The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.She started her Odissi journey with Smt.Dona Ganguly in Kolkata and holds a Sangeet Bhaskar in Odissi dance and a postgraduate degree in Mathematics.Her association with Nrityagram began in 2018 through a Summer Workshop, which paved the way for advanced training under the guidance of Surupa Sen and Pavithra Reddy.\u00a0Recognised for her talent and dedication, she was awarded the Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship. She has performed with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble across India, the US, Canada and Sri Lanka and was presented in a solo debut performance in November 2024.\u00a0At present, Anoushka is a dancer with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.ChoreographyGuru Kelucharan Mohapatra (Sun Maiyy\u0101)Surupa SenMusic CompositionPt.

Usiru Breathwork guides you to re-train your nervous system using breath, scientific, somatic, and meditative tools so you can heal anxiety, calm your mind, and restore inner peace.Under the guidance of Raanika D. Kararia, an experienced breath master and healer, this session integrates breathwork, meditation, energy release, and guided healing techniques to support deep relaxation and enhance resilience and adaptability. We conduct an HRV coherence assessment before and after the breathwork session to measure shifts in autonomic balance. The change in coherence and variability reflects how effectively the practice activates the parasympathetic system. A simple Nervous System Score is also provided to indicate emotional regulation and overall well-being.",

    "description": "In an era where Gen Zs and millennials seek meaning through experiences rather than possessions, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle \u2013 Stories of Friendships & Adventures in Nature offers exactly the kind of soulful escape today\u2019s young adventurers crave. For those who live for spontaneous road trips, mountain treks, beach escapades, and serendipitous conversations with strangers\u2014and secretly nurture the hope of finding love and companionship along the way\u2014Priyanka Kumar\u2019s latest collection is a deeply relatable read. With its mix of short stories and memoir-style reflections, this book resonates with those who believe that real connection and personal discovery often happen far away from the familiar.The newest installment in Priyanka\u2019s celebrated People\u2019s Kafe series, Whispers from the Lighthouse of Galle brings together heartfelt stories and travel-infused memories that capture the healing magic of nature and the unspoken bonds we form with people and places. Though it\u2019s not a travelogue in the conventional sense, the book reads like one\u2014with vivid glimpses into landscapes and emotions that stay with the reader long after they turn the final page.And yet, the book is as much about the people as it is about the places. There are tales of peacocks who roamed her childhood garden like kin, strangers-turned-friends on spontaneous journeys, and even encounters that subtly hint at love blossoming when least expected. The presence of love\u2014gentle, unforced, and organic\u2014is a quiet undercurrent in a couple of these stories, offering a warm, relatable thread for every romantic dreamer who has ever looked out of a train window and wondered, what if?",

Memories of Isaac Alb\u00e9niz\u2019 Asturias. Chick Corea\u2019s Spain and Bill Evans\u2019 harmonic explorations in Blue in Green.Perhaps you might remember the lines \u201cWe are stardust, we are golden, billion year old carbon\u2026\" Or, Craig Santos Perez\u2019s riff on Pablo Neruda\u2019s Sonnet XVII \u201cI love you like this because we'll only survive / in the nitrogen rich compost of our embrace, / so close that your emissions of carbon are mine, / so close that your sea rises with my heat.\u201dPerhaps the darkness of carbon can awaken new mysteries for us.\"Felt blessed indeed for being privy to this ~ letting Kuki's music & musicality wash over us with such finesse & intricacy ~\" - Parveen Sikand\"Thank you Kuki for your generosity and magic. The songs were personal, you let us into your process of creation, into your mind and its glorious journeys. Still humming a couple of tunes.\" - Rajeev Ravindranathan\"It was a magical and sublime experience. Love, creativity, and music flowed into the entire space and enveloped us.\"- Leenatha Reddy",

    "name": "My Life Closed Twice: Book Launch",
    "description": "Author Subhashini Kaligotla launches her new poetry collection My Life Closed Twice (Copper Coin, 2025), with Jeet Thayil.In My Life Closed Twice, Subhashini Kaligotla charts the long aftermath of grief, and its recursive, obsessive cadences. Drawing on premodern India\u2019s art, literature, and history, through invented forms and received ones, in fragments, litanies, lists, and queries, the poems in this spare volume embody the psychological terrain of the grieving. Two premature deaths are at the heart of the book. Kaligotla writes of their immediate aftereffects and their enduring impact. She braids her voice with voices from India\u2019s past\u2014from the unknown bards of the Sanskrit epics who counsel equanimity in the face of catastrophe to the laments of Ashoka, Bilhana, and Jahangir.Author BioSubhashini Kaligotla is a poet and an art historian of ancient and medieval South Asia. She is author of the poetry collection Bird of the Indian Subcontinent and the monograph Shiva\u2019s Waterfront Temples. She teaches at Columbia, dividing her time between New York City and Hyderabad.Advance Praise for My Life Closed TwiceSubhashini Kaligotla\u2019s ingeniously fashioned poetic structures\u2014which are light, flexible, delicate yet possessed of remarkable tensile strength and architectural clarity and integrity\u2014aren\u2019t just beautiful in themselves. They\u2019re also vessels for deep imaginative feeling and thinking and wondering and longing. She has a unique, compelling lyric voice and a distinguished twenty-first century consciousness.-Vijay SeshadriAnger, denial, bargaining, despair, all the stages of grief except acceptance, each stage overlaid with the forensic precision generated by love when it has nowhere to go. These enraged, laceratingly plainspoken poems burn with the singular self-awareness that is the writer's curse, and the writer's gift. Two deaths enclose the book like 'two dates // enclosed / by parentheses'. It is impossible to read, say, 'Only Your Brother Will You Lose' \u2013 its fifty shards hammered into the flesh like fifty nine-inch nails \u2013 and come away unscathed. -Jeet Thayil",
