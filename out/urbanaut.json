A unique and compelling voice as a player and composer, he is part of the hugely successful supergroup Cross Currents led by Zakir Hussain and featuring stalwarts such as Dave Holland, Vinnie Colaiuta, Chris Potter, Eddie Daniels, Shankar Mahadevan and Louiz Banks. Through a luminous 35 year long career, Sanjay has worked with artists such as Angelique Kidjo, Carlos Santana, Michael McDonald, Fred Raulston, Dave Weckl, Louis Johnson, Dumazz and Sambaguru among others.He also collaborated with A.R. Rahman on the Danny Boyle movie \u201c127 Hours\u201d that won \u2018Best Original Score\u2019, the OST for the movie \u201cWoman on Top\u201d with Argentinian composer Luis Bacalov, Sanjay also scored for the movie \u2018Leela\u2019 by Somnath Sen which won a Special Jury Award at Toronto Reel World Film Festival.An alumnus (1989) from Musician\u2019s Institute (M.I) in Los Angeles, Sanjay continues to mentor and develop musicians all over the country. His students are not only guitar players, but composers, musicians and singers of all disciplines. Sanjay teaches private lessons and holds workshops to develop musicality and a well rounded aesthetic sensibility in musicians.\u00a0Sanjay Divecha on the music of 'Leela' :\" As a human being on this planet I\u2019ve always believed in the Oneness of all things in this universe. Going through life's bylanes and observing how events unfold and teach you the lessons to be learned, this belief of Oneness has only strengthened with time.\u00a0My work as an artist has primarily been to connect with my inner self, and express from a place\u00a0of honesty. The yearning to learn something new in my art and refine my skill set has been my constant companion.\u00a0After having written and performed music with various ensembles, I finally mustered up the courage to record a collection of music which was mainly written for solo guitar, and also mainly recorded on acoustic guitar. These songs are reflections of some of my journeys and inspirations, interpreted in a spontaneous and instinctive manner.\u00a0The title 'Leela' refers to the divine Leela - joyous and playful - yet a profound act of creation.\u00a0As I started the recording process I started to add a few layers to enhance the music and some guest artists came on board to\u00a0complete the\u00a0experience which was truly fulfilling for me as an artist. The organic nature of this work takes me back to my formative years as a guitar player and I\u2019m grateful to be sharing this work and for it to take its own journey.\u00a0\"SEATING ON FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS",

    "description": "Madhuragati - Every step in Odissi resounds with the sweetness of a cultural aesthetic formed over centuries of aspiration for a higher goal.. To celebrate the beauty of this exquisite dance form arising from the life and beliefs of the people of forgone times till now.\u00a0Anoushka will perform dance works that showcase a range of possibilities highlighting the sculptural and expressive qualities of the Odissi style.The performance features five pieces, seamlessly connected by brief introductory interludes. This carefully crafted format offers an engaging experience for the audience, guiding them through the beauty of the Odissi classical dance form. Originally a sacred ritual dedicated to the gods, Odissi is one of the oldest dance traditions in the world. Odissi speaks of love and union, between the human and divine, transporting viewers to enchanted worlds of magic and spirituality. Its sensuous and lyrical grace reflects both the motifs of Odisha temple sculpture as well as the poetry from the deep wellsprings of Odia music.Anoushka Rahman, disciple of Guru Surupa Sen, is the new soloist and emerging star of The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.She started her Odissi journey with Smt.Dona Ganguly in Kolkata and holds a Sangeet Bhaskar in Odissi dance and a postgraduate degree in Mathematics.Her association with Nrityagram began in 2018 through a Summer Workshop, which paved the way for advanced training under the guidance of Surupa Sen and Pavithra Reddy.\u00a0Recognised for her talent and dedication, she was awarded the Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship. She has performed with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble across India, the US, Canada and Sri Lanka and was presented in a solo debut performance in November 2024.\u00a0At present, Anoushka is a dancer with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.ChoreographyGuru Kelucharan Mohapatra (Sun Maiyy\u0101)Surupa SenMusic CompositionPt.

E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours.",

Over time, these roles shape how we move through the world. But they can also start to feel tight, tiring, or simply out of sync with who we\u2019re becoming.This lab is a pause point. A space to gently step back, trace the roles you've held, and ask: Which parts of me still feel true? Which roles do I want to carry forward, reshape, or shed? And what new ways of being might I want to try on?Guided by master practitioner Ragini Rao, this experience draws on Transactional Analysis (TA) to explore identity through the lens of role theory\u2014offering a mix of simple frameworks, shared stories, and playful reflection.What you\u2019ll experience:A guided mapping of the many roles you currently live\u2014professional, relational, socialSpace to notice which roles feel energising, and which feel heavy or outdatedAn introduction to core TA tools: Role Theory \u2013 how we perform, inherit, and outgrow roles Strokes \u2013 how we seek and give recognition Autonomy \u2013 the power to notice patterns and choose new onesOptional sharing, quiet reflection, and a sense of lightness in explorationIdeal for:People navigating change\u2014career shifts, caregiving transitions, or identity questionsThose holding multiple responsibilities and wondering who they are beyond themAnyone feeling \u201cin between\u201d roles and unsure what comes nextIndividuals curious about structured self-reflection without pressureWhat to bring:\ud83c\udfad A willingness to meet yourself where you are \ud83d\udcd3 A notebook or journal (optional) \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Curiosity, and maybe a little humour",

    "description": "For ages 16 and abovewhere you from:So tell me, where are you from, now that you're here?Are you from earth's kernels, or a childhood lane?Are you from a summer of love, or your innate politics?Are you from where they say you're from, or have you yet to find out?Where You From?About the show:This genre-defining show offers glimpses into the changing identities of a body in continued performance. Bringing cliff notes from a decade-long practice in creating works of words, Nupur Azadi - a slam poet who emerged from Singapore - shows what is possible when meditations in movement, voicework, spoken word, and theatrical traditions come together.-65-minute, devised-solo told in fours acts, without intermission.-Multi-disciplinary and multi-media show suitable for audiences 16+.-This show is part of the A Decade of Theatrical Poetry celebration and was first shown during BLR Hubba in December 2024. It was followed by Jagriti Theatre in February 2025 and Sabha BLR in June 2025.\u00a0About the artist:Nupur Azadi (she/her) is an international stage artist who creates works of words. She is a self-taught, multi-disciplinary artist who emerged from the close-knit slam poetry spaces of Singapore in 2015. Her work has been hailed as \u2018urgent\u2019 and \u2018engaging\u2019 by a global audience. In 2022 she conceptualized, wrote, produced, directed, and performed in a one-woman theatrical poetry show called \u2018Live. Love. Loaf. An investigation into who gets to loiter\u2019. Over 2022 and 2023 she performed the same across various venues in Bangalore and NALSAR, Hyderabad before taking it to Singapore and Cambodia. As a student of Voicework, and of literary pedagogies, and a continued participant in movement arts learnings, she labors over foraging a physicality to the previously textual genre of spoken word. She intertwines spoken word, theatre, music, and movement into an art form she christened Theatrical Poetry.Read reviews: \"When Nupur speaks, you listen. What a performance!\" -Vasu Dixit\u00a0\"Met so many women and their stories in one tonight\"\u00a0- Sal Yusuf\"Found a whole new genre in this show.\"\u00a0- Damini Gairola\"Azadi at her courageous best!\"\u00a0- Dipankar Panth",
