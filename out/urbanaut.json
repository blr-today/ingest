    "description": "We're bringing Studio Ghibli's magic to life at Bento Bento!Chef Anumitra of Edible Archives and Bento Bento, a lifelong fan of Studio Ghibli, has masterfully translated some beloved food scenes from Miyazaki's cherished films from the big screen to the plate. All fans of these movies and series are familiar with their iconic dishes, and Chef Anumitra, with her extensive travel and work experience in Japan, has the expertise needed to make these dishes authentic and delicious. Menu Highlights\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bacon and Eggs (Howl's Moving Castle) A skillet of fresh eggs cooked with thickly sliced bacon. While it won't be cooked with the help of a fire demon, it will still be done to perfection.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pancakes, Bacon, Sausage, and Tomato (Kiki's Delivery Service) This simple yet filling breakfast feast is delicious and demonstrates that breakfast can be an all-day meal.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ramen (Ponyo) This iconic scene features simple yet delicious ramen. Our versions include in-house ramen noodles in a shoyu broth, either as a vegetarian option, or with slices of ham and a half-boiled egg, replicating the home-style preparation in Japan.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Onigiri (Spirited Away) In the series, these rice balls help Chihiro escape with their hidden superpowers. Ours might not have magic powers, but they are definitely high on magical taste with surprise fillings.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Satsuki\u2019s Bento Box (My Neighbor Totoro) Totoro is one of the most iconic Ghibli films, loved worldwide. Our bento box stays true to the traditional offering in the series with minor variations.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mackerel Fry (Up on Poppy Hill) This butterflied mackerel dish is iconic in its scene and delicious in taste.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lupin III Spaghetti (The Castle of Cagliostro) This dish is featured in a memorable scene where Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III enjoys spaghetti with his friend Jigen. Although it seems unusual, it showcases how Japanese cuisine embraces Western dishes.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tomato Stew with Cheesy Bread (Tales from Earthsea) A simple, flavourful tomato soup perfect for the gloomy Bangalore weather.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rich Double Chocolate Cake (Kiki's Delivery Service) A cake fully approved by the young witch Kiki, making it the perfect way to end the meal.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anman\u00a0(Spirited Away) A steamed bun with red bean paste, it showcases traditional Japanese dessert flavours in an unusual profile for Indian palates.The dishes will be served \u00e0 la carte, over both lunch and dinner. Join us for a magical culinary journey as we bring the enchanting world of Studio Ghibli to life in Bangalore!",

    "description": "We're bringing Studio Ghibli's magic to life at Bento Bento!Chef Anumitra of Edible Archives and Bento Bento, a lifelong fan of Studio Ghibli, has masterfully translated some beloved food scenes from Miyazaki's cherished films from the big screen to the plate. All fans of these movies and series are familiar with their iconic dishes, and Chef Anumitra, with her extensive travel and work experience in Japan, has the expertise needed to make these dishes authentic and delicious. Menu Highlights\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bacon and Eggs (Howl's Moving Castle) A skillet of fresh eggs cooked with thickly sliced bacon. While it won't be cooked with the help of a fire demon, it will still be done to perfection.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pancakes, Bacon, Sausage, and Tomato (Kiki's Delivery Service) This simple yet filling breakfast feast is delicious and demonstrates that breakfast can be an all-day meal.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ramen (Ponyo) This iconic scene features simple yet delicious ramen. Our versions include in-house ramen noodles in a shoyu broth, either as a vegetarian option, or with slices of ham and a half-boiled egg, replicating the home-style preparation in Japan.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Onigiri (Spirited Away) In the series, these rice balls help Chihiro escape with their hidden superpowers. Ours might not have magic powers, but they are definitely high on magical taste with surprise fillings.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Satsuki\u2019s Bento Box (My Neighbor Totoro) Totoro is one of the most iconic Ghibli films, loved worldwide. Our bento box stays true to the traditional offering in the series with minor variations.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mackerel Fry (Up on Poppy Hill) This butterflied mackerel dish is iconic in its scene and delicious in taste.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lupin III Spaghetti (The Castle of Cagliostro) This dish is featured in a memorable scene where Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III enjoys spaghetti with his friend Jigen. Although it seems unusual, it showcases how Japanese cuisine embraces Western dishes.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tomato Stew with Cheesy Bread (Tales from Earthsea) A simple, flavourful tomato soup perfect for the gloomy Bangalore weather.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rich Double Chocolate Cake (Kiki's Delivery Service) A cake fully approved by the young witch Kiki, making it the perfect way to end the meal.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anman\u00a0(Spirited Away) A steamed bun with red bean paste, it showcases traditional Japanese dessert flavours in an unusual profile for Indian palates.The dishes will be served \u00e0 la carte, over both lunch and dinner.

    "description": "We're bringing Studio Ghibli's magic to life at Bento Bento!Chef Anumitra of Edible Archives and Bento Bento, a lifelong fan of Studio Ghibli, has masterfully translated some beloved food scenes from Miyazaki's cherished films from the big screen to the plate. All fans of these movies and series are familiar with their iconic dishes, and Chef Anumitra, with her extensive travel and work experience in Japan, has the expertise needed to make these dishes authentic and delicious. Menu Highlights\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bacon and Eggs (Howl's Moving Castle) A skillet of fresh eggs cooked with thickly sliced bacon. While it won't be cooked with the help of a fire demon, it will still be done to perfection.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pancakes, Bacon, Sausage, and Tomato (Kiki's Delivery Service) This simple yet filling breakfast feast is delicious and demonstrates that breakfast can be an all-day meal.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ramen (Ponyo) This iconic scene features simple yet delicious ramen. Our versions include in-house ramen noodles in a shoyu broth, either as a vegetarian option, or with slices of ham and a half-boiled egg, replicating the home-style preparation in Japan.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Onigiri (Spirited Away) In the series, these rice balls help Chihiro escape with their hidden superpowers. Ours might not have magic powers, but they are definitely high on magical taste with surprise fillings.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Satsuki\u2019s Bento Box (My Neighbor Totoro) Totoro is one of the most iconic Ghibli films, loved worldwide. Our bento box stays true to the traditional offering in the series with minor variations.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mackerel Fry (Up on Poppy Hill) This butterflied mackerel dish is iconic in its scene and delicious in taste.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lupin III Spaghetti (The Castle of Cagliostro) This dish is featured in a memorable scene where Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III enjoys spaghetti with his friend Jigen. Although it seems unusual, it showcases how Japanese cuisine embraces Western dishes.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tomato Stew with Cheesy Bread (Tales from Earthsea) A simple, flavourful tomato soup perfect for the gloomy Bangalore weather.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rich Double Chocolate Cake (Kiki's Delivery Service) A cake fully approved by the young witch Kiki, making it the perfect way to end the meal.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anman\u00a0(Spirited Away) A steamed bun with red bean paste, it showcases traditional Japanese dessert flavours in an unusual profile for Indian palates.The dishes will be served \u00e0 la carte, over both lunch and dinner.
