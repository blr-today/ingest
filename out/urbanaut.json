    "description": "Have You Ever Experienced Dining in a Traditional Bohra Thaal?If not, here\u2019s your chance to be part of an intimate and one-of-a-kind home dining experience. Hosted in the comfort of a warm, welcoming home, this gathering brings together like-minded individuals to share a meal, exchange stories, and turn strangers into friends\u2014all while indulging in the rich flavors of Bohra cuisine.Bohra cuisine originates from the Bohra Muslim community, with roots tracing back to Yemen before flourishing in India. Over the centuries, it has evolved into a delightful fusion of Middle Eastern, Mughlai, Gujarati, and Maharashtrian flavors, reflecting a legacy of migration, trade, and cultural influences.What makes Bohra dining truly special is its communal style\u2014meals are served in a giant \"Thaal\", where 4 to 6 guests dine together, fostering a deep sense of connection, warmth, and tradition.From Finance to Flavours: My Journey into Bohra CuisineAs a Chartered Accountant, I built a career in finance, working with esteemed firms like Avendus and ASK. While finance was my profession, my true passion lay in cooking.Back in Mumbai, my home-cooked meals were always a highlight among friends and colleagues.

    "description": "Sanjay Divecha is one of the most revered guitar players in India. A unique and compelling voice as a player and composer, he is part of the hugely successful supergroup Cross Currents led by Zakir Hussain and featuring stalwarts such as Dave Holland, Vinnie Colaiuta, Chris Potter, Eddie Daniels, Shankar Mahadevan and Louiz Banks. Through a luminous 35 year long career, Sanjay has worked with artists such as Angelique Kidjo, Carlos Santana, Michael McDonald, Fred Raulston, Dave Weckl, Louis Johnson, Dumazz and Sambaguru among others.He also collaborated with A.R. Rahman on the Danny Boyle movie \u201c127 Hours\u201d that won \u2018Best Original Score\u2019, the OST for the movie \u201cWoman on Top\u201d with Argentinian composer Luis Bacalov, Sanjay also scored for the movie \u2018Leela\u2019 by Somnath Sen which won a Special Jury Award at Toronto Reel World Film Festival.An alumnus (1989) from Musician\u2019s Institute (M.I) in Los Angeles, Sanjay continues to mentor and develop musicians all over the country. His students are not only guitar players, but composers, musicians and singers of all disciplines. Sanjay teaches private lessons and holds workshops to develop musicality and a well rounded aesthetic sensibility in musicians.\u00a0Sanjay Divecha on the music of 'Leela' :\" As a human being on this planet I\u2019ve always believed in the Oneness of all things in this universe. Going through life's bylanes and observing how events unfold and teach you the lessons to be learned, this belief of Oneness has only strengthened with time.\u00a0My work as an artist has primarily been to connect with my inner self, and express from a place\u00a0of honesty. The yearning to learn something new in my art and refine my skill set has been my constant companion.\u00a0After having written and performed music with various ensembles, I finally mustered up the courage to record a collection of music which was mainly written for solo guitar, and also mainly recorded on acoustic guitar. These songs are reflections of some of my journeys and inspirations, interpreted in a spontaneous and instinctive manner.\u00a0The title 'Leela' refers to the divine Leela - joyous and playful - yet a profound act of creation.\u00a0As I started the recording process I started to add a few layers to enhance the music and some guest artists came on board to\u00a0complete the\u00a0experience which was truly fulfilling for me as an artist. The organic nature of this work takes me back to my formative years as a guitar player and I\u2019m grateful to be sharing this work and for it to take its own journey.\u00a0\"SEATING ON FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS",

    "description": "Madhuragati - Every step in Odissi resounds with the sweetness of a cultural aesthetic formed over centuries of aspiration for a higher goal.. To celebrate the beauty of this exquisite dance form arising from the life and beliefs of the people of forgone times till now.\u00a0Anoushka will perform dance works that showcase a range of possibilities highlighting the sculptural and expressive qualities of the Odissi style.The performance features five pieces, seamlessly connected by brief introductory interludes. This carefully crafted format offers an engaging experience for the audience, guiding them through the beauty of the Odissi classical dance form. Originally a sacred ritual dedicated to the gods, Odissi is one of the oldest dance traditions in the world. Odissi speaks of love and union, between the human and divine, transporting viewers to enchanted worlds of magic and spirituality. Its sensuous and lyrical grace reflects both the motifs of Odisha temple sculpture as well as the poetry from the deep wellsprings of Odia music.Anoushka Rahman, disciple of Guru Surupa Sen, is the new soloist and emerging star of The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.She started her Odissi journey with Smt.Dona Ganguly in Kolkata and holds a Sangeet Bhaskar in Odissi dance and a postgraduate degree in Mathematics.Her association with Nrityagram began in 2018 through a Summer Workshop, which paved the way for advanced training under the guidance of Surupa Sen and Pavithra Reddy.\u00a0Recognised for her talent and dedication, she was awarded the Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship. She has performed with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble across India, the US, Canada and Sri Lanka and was presented in a solo debut performance in November 2024.\u00a0At present, Anoushka is a dancer with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.ChoreographyGuru Kelucharan Mohapatra (Sun Maiyy\u0101)Surupa SenMusic CompositionPt.

    "description": "This session is designed for those seeking legal clarity around personal rights, succession planning, and legacy\u2014without the stress of one-on-one consultations or complicated legalese.Led by a senior advocate and legal expert, the experience will gently walk you through key questions many of us avoid:\u2013 What happens if there is no will? \u2013 How are assets typically inherited or contested? \u2013 What\u2019s the difference between nomination and succession? \u2013 What kind of paperwork is good to have in place, and why?We often spend decades building lives, families, and futures\u2014but rarely pause to understand the systems that hold it all. This session creates space for that pause.You won\u2019t be asked to share personal details. This is not a therapy or legal advice session. It is a practical, high-level walkthrough to help you feel more informed and in control.Come if you're ready to: \u2013 Get your legal basics in place \u2013 Understand succession planning with more ease \u2013 Feel more confident about your next stepsThis is part of Zuva Life\u2019s wider effort to support individuals in navigating transitions\u2014gently, wisely, and with good information.",
