You could even swap a card with your tablemates and design one for each other.By the end, you\u2019ll have a one-of-a-kind deck and, at the very least, a great conversation starter the next time you play bluff (or any card game, really).As always, come as you are. Make, watch, chat, or just be.See you for a slow, creative start to the year \u2661About the clubWhat is the Eleven AM Club A space for slow, intentional gatherings where time stretches, stories unfold, and creativity finds room to breathe. At Eleven AM Club, we come together to write, draw, cook, read, play, or simply be\u2014no rush, no agenda, just a day well spent.",

No walk-ins.Each ticket gives you entry for 2 People i.e you + your rope partner. What is Shibari?Shibari is a contemporary form of rope bondage that was originated in Japan in the early 1200-1800's. Later popularized in the 21st century as a pleasure-craft. Shibari, despite its various styles, adheres to a certain aesthetic and exclusively uses ropes as a primary tool to build trust and connect with oneself and others.What to expect?3 hour weekly in-person hands-on lessons100% Vetted ParticipantsJapanese Asanawa (Hemp ropes) for the classFree access to Rope Jams1:1 Technical & Safety guidance throughout the programPost-course integration supportLimited Edition SHS MerchThis is a structured learning space that explores mind\u2013body engagement through rope. The course supports flexibility in awareness, communication, and embodied practice, using rope as a practical and intentional tool. Safety, consent, and consistency remain central to the learning process.We will cover the fundamental knots, frictions, patterns, harnesses, and introduces participants to important skills such as rope handling and tensioning. By the end of the course, participants should understand how to construct a short rope scene that brings together technical and playful elements.Further InformationDates: Every Saturday starting 24th January, 2 pm - 5 pm.Where: The Bangalore Local, Koramangala, Bengaluru.Who can Join :Adults 21+ with no prior experience but plenty interest, LGBTQIA+ solo or with a rope partner.The ticket gives you entry for 2 People i.e you + your rope partner.Participants who sign up solo are encouraged to partner up with another solo-participant to practice the ties on each other. If you don\u2019t want to switch (both tie and be tied), then we would recommend coming with a partner.About the Facilitator: Amiya Bhanushali (she/they) is a queer multidisciplinary artist, contemporary curator and creative strategist. Her work explores art, human connection and design across all disciplines, with a focus on Indian and South Asian narratives. They began to explore Shibari in 2022 as an extension of their art and research into kink-based practices. As their style naturally progressed beyond aesthetics alone, they began to discover interconnections between queerness, pleasure, trauma and neurodivergence.Questions?

    "name": "Federica Colangelo Acquaphonica presents \u201cForward\u201d",
    "description": "About Aquaphonica:Acquaphonica is a contemporary jazz project led by Italian pianist and composer Federica Colangelo, conceived as a long-term creative laboratory where composition, improvisation, and cross-cultural rhythmic research converge.The trio explores a personal musical language shaped by contemporary jazz, 20th-century Western music, and South Indian Carnatic rhythmic traditions, with a strong focus on form, texture, and collective interaction.The current project, Forward, expands the trio format through the special participation of Carnatic percussion master B.C. Manjunath, deepening the rhythmic dimension and opening new perspectives on groove, time, and improvisation.About the artists:FEDERICA COLANGELO: piano, compositionFederica Colangelo is an Italian pianist and composer born in Rome. After studying classical piano at the Royal School of London, she moved to the Netherlands in her early twenties, where she continued her studies in jazz piano and later in contemporary composition.During her years in the Netherlands, she founded Acquaphonica, a project conceived from the outset as a creative laboratory for her original music. With Acquaphonica she has released three albums of original compositions: Private Enemy (2012), Chiaroscuro (2016), and Endless Tail (2019). The fourth album, Forward, is forthcoming and will be presented in October 2025.Her work is characterized by continuous exploration and experimentation, drawing from jazz improvisation and compositional practices, 20th-century European and American music (including influences such as Charles Ives, Philip Glass, John Cage, and Igor Stravinsky), and the rich rhythmic traditions of South Indian Carnatic music. These elements form the basis of her distinctive compositional voice.Alongside Acquaphonica, Colangelo writes and arranges music for various ensembles. Notable works include Undecided (2010) for a 14-piece orchestra, composed during a close collaboration with Dutch composer Otto Ketting and later performed and recorded by the HKU Conservatory Youth Orchestra. In 2014 she arranged six traditional Bulgarian songs for string quintet, presented at the Apollonia Art Festival (Bulgaria). In 2016 she arranged her composition Graphic Work (from the album Chiaroscuro, Alfa Music) for the Civica Big Band, performed at Teatro Piccolo di Milano within the \u201cNew Generations\u201d series.In May 2024 she launched Advaita Crescendo, an international quintet formed in Amsterdam, bringing together Indian and Western musicians: veena virtuoso Dr. Suma Sudhindra, flutist and composer Ned McGowan, percussionist Karthik Mani, bassist Laurent Peckels, and Federica Colangelo on piano. The project blends European composition with Carnatic melodic, rhythmic, and improvisational concepts in the search for a shared musical language.She is also active in the duo Timelines with vocalist Giulia Cianca, currently working on an album inspired by the life and writings of Joyce Lussu.Since 2021, Federica Colangelo has been teaching Jazz Composition at the Conservatories of Campobasso and Udine.Throughout her career she has collaborated with numerous internationally active musicians and performed at festivals and venues across Europe and India.IGOR LEGARI \u2013 double bassIgor Legari is an Italian double bassist, improviser, and educator based in Rome since 2011, where he is an active presence in the jazz and improvised music scene.His trio ARBO, with Marco Colonna and Ermanno Baron, released its debut album in 2022 on Folderol Records, receiving widespread critical acclaim, including being cited among the best Italian jazz albums of the year. In March 2024 he recorded Something About It, the debut album of Fabrizio Sferra\u2019s new quartet featuring Francesco Bearzatti and Giovanni Guidi, to be released by Parco della Musica Records.Legari is a member of Ettore Fioravanti\u2019s Opus Magnum, with which he has released two albums (Opus Magnum, AlfaMusic 2019; Attraverso ogni confine, Parco della Musica Records 2022). He is also part of pianist Francesco Negro\u2019s trio, with whom he has recorded three albums between 2011 and 2022.He collaborates extensively with composer Teho Teardo, both for film and fashion soundtracks and for live multimedia productions. Together with Susanna Buffa, he created the project Quando l\u2019Anarchia Verr\u00e0, dedicated to libertarian songs of the 19th and 20th centuries, published in December 2024 by Kurumuny.A founding member of the trio LUZ, he has toured extensively across Europe and recorded two albums for Auand Records. He has also been a key figure in the Roman improvisation collective Franco Ferguson.Legari holds a diploma in Jazz Double Bass from the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome and a degree in Sociology. He has taught Jazz Ensemble at the Conservatorio \u201cF. Morlacchi\u201d of Perugia.GIOVANNI NARDIELLO \u2013 drumsBorn in 1995, Giovanni Nardiello began his musical journey at a young age, influenced by his father. He started his professional career at 16, performing in projects ranging from indie rock to pop, experiences that led him to open concerts for major Italian artists such as Marlene Kuntz, Thegiornalisti, and members of Afterhours.In parallel, he began studying jazz in 2015, focusing on improvisation and contemporary languages. He studied with leading figures of the international jazz scene, including Gregory Hutchinson, Ziv Ravitz, Jim Black, Stefano Battaglia, and Ralph Alessi.In 2021 he moved to Tallinn, where he studied Contemporary Improvisation at the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre and took part in masterclasses with artists such as Marc Ribot and Le Quan Ninh.He has been involved in several award-winning projects, including the Alessandro Pennino Trio, which won the Val d\u2019Agri Jazz Festival and recorded the album Memento (2019, WoW Records). His project Perspectives was a finalist at the Premio Isio Saba 2023.In 2022 he released Kairi with the trio Triologic, featuring guest trumpeter Ralph Alessi. Currently based in Siena, he is working on his first album as a leader while collaborating with numerous contemporary jazz and experimental ensembles.SPECIAL GUESTB.C. MANJUNATH \u2013 Carnatic percussionB.C. Manjunath is one of the leading exponents of South Indian Carnatic percussion of his generation. Trained within the traditional Carnatic system, he is internationally recognized for his mastery of mridangam and konnakol, as well as for his ability to engage in cross-cultural musical contexts.Active both in India and internationally, he has collaborated with leading figures of Indian classical music and with musicians from the jazz and contemporary music worlds. His work is distinguished by a deep rhythmic sophistication, precision, and a strong sense of musical dialogue.Within Acquaphonica \u2013 Forward, Manjunath\u2019s participation expands the trio\u2019s rhythmic framework, introducing Carnatic rhythmic concepts into an open improvisational context. His presence plays a central role in redefining time, groove, and interaction, contributing decisively to the project\u2019s sonic identity.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait.

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "Welcome to Naples. Well, almost. At Serious Slice, we take our Napoli roots very seriously. Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

Every dish, every process is driven by a deep obsession with Neapolitan pizza and the streets that shaped it, where time, fire, and simplicity do the heavy lifting.Our dough ferments for 72 hours before it ever meets the flame, creating crusts that are light, airy, and blistered just the way Napoli intended. The tomatoes are always San Marzano, bright and balanced. The mozzarella melts soft and gentle. Every pizza carries the soul of a city that takes its food personally.Whether you swear by the OG Margherita or chase bolder flavours, the craft always remains the constant.At our flagship on Cunningham Road, we\u2019ve kept things honest and unfussy. Walk through the blue doors and you enter a warm, intimate space \u2014 mosaic art on the walls with quiet nods to Naples, and the crackle of fire you hear instantly from our open kitchen. No backstage. Just dough, flame, and movement.With just 40 seats and an open kitchen, Serious Slice is intimate, warm, and always led by the food and the craft.Weekends are seriously special: Every weekend, we roll out two limited-edition pizzas that don\u2019t stick around for long. Tartufo-E-Fungi \u2013 with button mushrooms, capers, pecorino cheese, and a heady drizzle of truffle oil \u2014 earthy, bold, and seriously indulgent. Napoli Salsiccia \u2013 with Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, onion, red paprika, and button mushrooms \u2014 smoky, spicy, and unapologetically Napoli. Available only on weekends, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone.We\u2019re open every day from 12 PM to 11 PM \u2014 perfect for lazy lunches, late dinners, and everything in between. We also roll out frequent off-menu pizza and panuozzo drops \u2014 one-day-only creations that appear without warning and disappear just as fast, in limited quantities every time. Follow us so you never miss our flavour drops. We take loyalty seriously: Collect stamps on your Serious Passport and chase the flavour. Ask our staff to give you our loyalty card - to win free panuozzos and pizzas of your choosing. Please Note: We\u2019re a 40-seater, so reservations are recommended on weekends. Limited specials and collab menus are first-come, first-served. Panuozzos take a little extra time \u2014 they\u2019re worth the wait. Special events and collabs may run on timed seating.Serious Slice, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka.",

    "description": "BECAUSE GOOD GIRLS DON\u2019T CHANGE THE WORLD. For every woman who has been told she's \"too much,\" this is a memoir about becoming exactly who you're meant to be.Sangeeta Pillai was called a \"Bad Daughter\" for defying the rigid expectations placed on \"good Indian girls.\" But in her rebellion, she found her voice. From a harrowing childhood in a Mumbai slum-haunted by a violent father and the brutal murder of her mother-this is a story of resilience. With a fire in her belly, shebattled patriarchy, chased her dreams, and built a new life in London, creating a successful podcast to inspire other women. Yet, all her success couldn't outrun the past. Faced with debilitating mental health, she explored many healing avenues from psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, EMDR, acupuncture to Tantra. But to truly heal, she had to go back to her birthplace: tropical Kerala to confront her deep trauma. There, she experienced the most profound spiritual transformation in Kerala's ancient temples. Sangeeta's powerful, spiritual and deeply inspiring journey shows us that healing means finding your way back home to yourself. Bad Daughter is an inspirational feminist memoir for every woman who wants to break free. Ultimately, it's a reminder that the courage to be your authentic self can transform your own life - and the lives of those around you.Author Description:Sangeeta Pillai grew up in a Mumbai slum. Today, she is recognised as a leading voice for South Asian feminism globally. Award-winning podcaster, writer and feminist activist, Sangeeta is the creator of Masala Podcast (all about cultural taboos) which won 6 British Podcast Awards, 1 Audio Production Award & Spotify SoundUp 2018 award. She's also the founder of South Asian feminist network Soul Sutras. Sangeeta has been featured extensively in the press from BBC Radio, Guardian, Metro, Cosmopolitan, Evening Standard, Stylist, Eastern Eye to Huffington Post. As well as on giant billboards in New York, London, Dublin, Cardiff & Glasgow. She is also the creator of the Masala Monologues series of writing workshops & theatre shows in the UK & the US. Sangeeta is a regular speaker at WOW Festival, Podcast Show London, Shameless Festival, Primadonna Festival as well as being a regular speaker on innumerable panels and podcasts.",

He will talk about selected stories and engage informally with the audience. Signed copies of the book will be on sale.The following are sample extracts from reviews on Amazon globally and on Goodreads:\u2022 India: \u201cINDISHMAN reminded me of the lyrical beauty of Arundhati Roy, the vivid storytelling of Salman Rushdie, and the magic of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\u201d\u2022 UK: \u201cA lovely meander through the vagaries of human nature. Each story warms the heart like a good malt whisky. A very well-written book; I defy anyone not to enjoy it.\u201d\u2022 USA: \u201cIt (INDISHMAN) is hard to slot into a specific genre \u2013 the stories, reflections and gentle musings flit from rural Kerala to Nepal, from Southampton to the high seas with ease. They strike the perfect balance between being sharply observed and deeply memorable, yet light enough for an effortlessly enjoyable read, and never without a touch of humour and heart. Without a doubt, this has been the best six dollars and change I\u2019ve spent in a very long time.\u201d",

    "description": "Shaam-e-Baazgasht is an intimate, cosy, and immersive poetry experience drawn from Baazgasht \u2013 Echoes of Words & Silence, a bilingual Hindi\u2013English collection that journeys through unrequited love, longing, heartbreak, queerness, healing, and the quiet courage of letting go.More than a performance, it is a gathering that invites presence.Through selected poems from the Baazgasht series, the evening unfolds alongside the stories that birthed them \u2014 gentle, honest conversations with the poet on his own journey, interwoven with brief guided moments of breathing, mindfulness, and emotional reflection. Together, these elements create a space where words are not merely heard, but felt \u2014 allowing the audience to touch closure, clarity, and a softer, steadier kind of inner peace.Shaam-e-Baazgasht | Bengaluru Diaries offers an evening of listening, pausing, and returning \u2014 to oneself.

His work appears in numerous print and online platforms. This is his second book of poems.Babitha Marina Justin is a writer and visual artist who moves easily between a paintbrush and a pen. Her poetry lingers on memory, gender, and the small intimacies of everyday life, with a voice that can be tender one moment and uncompromising the next. She has written nine books, including three poetry collections, Of Fireflies, Guns and the Hills (2015), I Cook My Own Feast (2019), and Forty-Five Shades of Brown (2023). She also co-edited salt, pepper and silver linings: celebrating our grandmothers (2019), a tribute to resilience and inheritance.Salini Vineeth is a fiction writer and translator.

When was the last time you tried to explain why you like something?Not just \u201cit\u2019s good,\u201d but why it\u2019s good. Why this coffee works for you but another doesn\u2019t. Why a certain smell makes you feel at home. Why some flavours feel comforting and others feel like too much effort.Most of us realise, mid-sentence, that we don\u2019t quite have the language for it.That\u2019s because taste isn\u2019t just happening in the mouth. It\u2019s shaped by memory, by smell, by repetition, by culture, by the small habits we pick up without noticing. Flavour is something we learn, even when we think we haven\u2019t.What if we tell you that the next lecture will give you the framework to decode, understand and express taste and flavour like how you always wanted to. No more \u201cyummy\u201d, no more \u201cdelicious\u201d as you find ways to convey flavour in this lecture-cum-food-writing-workshop.This Sunday at Pint of View, we\u2019re spending an evening with someone who thinks about these things for a living.Your Speaker for the EveningShivani Unakar is a food researcher and creative practitioner based in Bangalore. Her work uses food as a way of thinking about people, place, and the systems that connect them.Over the past decade, she has worked across kitchens, farms, breweries, small businesses, FMCG brands, and food media platforms. Her practice is grounded in fieldwork, observation, and sensory exploration, and is driven by curiosity about how food carries memory and meaning.She brings this sensibility to A Matter of Taste, inviting us to pay attention to something we experience every day but rarely stop to examine.About the LectureFlavour isn't just in food, it's also in us.In the lecture A Matter of Taste, Shivani Unakar will unpack how we taste, describe, and design flavour.First, a look at the hidden art and science of tasting, from the way our brains perceive and interpret flavour through smell and memory, to how professionals in coffee, beer, wine and more train their senses to make the invisible visible.The lecture looks at flavour not as a fixed property of food, but as something shaped by perception, training, culture, and design. It moves from the inner workings of taste to the worlds that influence it, and asks how our understanding of flavour is changing.Event Details\ud83d\udccd 1st Floor, Atta Galatta, Indiranagar\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, 18th Jan, 4\u20136 pmSober drinks for the evening will be provided by Local Ferment Co..",

Inspired by the philosophy of John Muir Laws\u2014observation, curiosity, and wonder\u2014this session invites participants to look closely at everyday nature: backyard birds, leaves, flowers, insects, sounds, and fleeting moments that often go unnoticed.You don\u2019t need to be an artist or a writer. Nature journaling is not about perfection\u2014it\u2019s about paying attention. Through simple prompts, guided observation, and easy watercolor and drawing exercises, you\u2019ll learn how to record what you see, feel, and wonder about in your own sketchbook.This workshop is perfect if you want to:Slow down and be present in the momentBuild a regular nature journaling habitExplore watercolor and sketching in a relaxed, pressure-free wayReconnect with your curiosity and childlike sense of wonderUse art as a calming, mindful practiceBy the end of the session, you\u2019ll walk away with:A completed nature journal pageSimple tools and prompts you can reuse at homeIncreased confidence in observing and expressing natureA calmer, more grounded state of mindAll materials will be provided.About the FacilitatorThe workshop is facilitated by Charu Jain, a self-taught watercolor artist and illustrator with a deep love for storytelling and nature journaling.Charu\u2019s work is rooted in gentle observation, expressive lines, and a playful, hand-drawn watercolor style. She believes art is a way to slow down, listen deeply, and build a personal relationship with the natural world. Her practice combines illustration, journalling, and storytelling to make creativity feel accessible rather than intimidating.Through her workshops, Charu encourages participants to let go of \u201cgetting it right\u201d and instead focus on noticing, wondering, and enjoying the process. Her sessions are known for being warm, inclusive, and thoughtfully guided\u2014especially welcoming to beginners.",
