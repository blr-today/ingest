With an emphasis on process over outcome, the practice encourages a more intuitive way of working; embracing flow, experimentation, and quiet observation. Through repetition and gentle focus, it becomes as much a reflective practice as a creative one.

    "description": "What is Circular Connected Breathing (CCB)?Circular Connected Breathing is a simple yet profound practice where the inhale and exhale flow continuously without noticeable pauses. This rhythmic breath anchors you into the body\u2019s innate wisdom, calms the mind, and opens a gateway to emotional healing, deeper awareness, and self-integration. As the body relaxes into the breathing cycle, hidden memories, emotions, and insights can gently surface, offering a powerful space for transformation.About the Experience:There is a part of you that learned early to strive, survive, and stay strong but beneath it all, your inner child still carries the imprints of unmet needs, longings, and emotional wounds.In\u00a0Whispers Within, a Circular Connected Breathing Journey held in a nurturing and gentle space, we create a bridge between your wise adult self and the tender child within. The Flow of the Journey:We begin with a soft grounding practice to arrive into the body and gently preparing the nervous system.You'll be invited to set an inner intention for the journey.From there, we move into the Circular Connected Breathing session, allowing the breath to guide you into deeper layers of emotional memory, connection, and healing.We will close with a gentle meditation, a short reflective writing exercise and an optional sharing circle to help integrate your experience with care and tenderness.Through breath and loving presence, you\u2019ll be invited to:\u2728 Recognize the emotional patterns rooted in childhood experiences\u2728 Meet the needs of your inner child with compassion and understanding\u2728 Heal the push-pull between responsibility and emotional vulnerability\u2728 Reclaim spontaneity, softness, and emotional wholenessThis is not about fixing or forcing change.It\u2019s about listening, honouring, and gently negotiating between your inner child and adult self so you can walk forward in life with more freedom and authenticity.Please bring:A yoga mat and anything you need to feel cozy lying down (scarf, eye mask, shawl, etc.)About the Facilitator:Maria is an intuitive healer and guide who transitioned from a thriving corporate career to the healing arts.\u00a0With over 8 years of experience, she weaves Breathwork, Reiki, Tarot, Access Bars, Shadow Constellations, and psychotherapy-inspired methods into deeply grounding and expansive journeys. Her sessions create space for emotional, spiritual and energetic healing - inviting you to drop into your body, regulate your nervous system and return home to yourself.",

It\u2019s about tracing the moments that made us fall in love with cinema \u2014 and asking why certain films stay with us. Whether it`s the one that cracked you open emotionally, reshaped your politics, made you feel seen, or just stuck with you for reasons you still can`t explain... this session is where we bring those films into the room.What to expect :\u2013 A guided, open-format discussion where each person brings in a film that\u2019s meant something to them\u2013 Reflections on memory, identity, and how our personal histories shape our taste\u2013 Conversations that might be nostalgic, tender, surprising, even a little heated \u2014 because meaning is rarely neutral\u2013 A collective attempt to understand: Why do we watch? And what do these films do to us \u2014 culturally, emotionally, politically, psychologically?You don\u2019t need to be a \u201cfilm buff\u201d to show up \u2014 but if you`re someone who feels things deeply when you watch a film, or who`s ever been changed by one, you\u2019ll fit right in.We\u2019ll end the session with a short, collective viewing \u2014 a curated piece that ties into the theme \u2014 followed by closing thoughts.Come with a film in your heart. Come with something to say. Come with an open mind.Let\u2019s find out what happens when you put a group of people in a room and ask them to speak, not about film \u2014 but through it.Host - Venkatesh & Sri",
