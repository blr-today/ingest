Hosted by The LooRoo Club in collaboration with Coro, this 1-hour session provides a space for parents to unwind and explore hands-on art while their children immerse in sensory, nature-based, and open-ended creative activities.For Kids: Inspired by Sunu Sunu Snail (Age: 3 to 8 years)The children's session will begin with a storytelling session based on Sunu Sunu Snail by Ashok Rajagopalan, a charming tale that follows the journey of a little snail and his encounters with nature. Following the story, children will engage in sensory, art, and nature-based activities inspired by the book, offering them a hands-on, exploratory experience in true LooRoo style. The activities will be designed to reflect the themes of the story, bringing Sunu Sunu's world to life in a playful way.For Parents: A Creative Surprise!At The Art Caf\u00e9, we believe that the best creative experiences happen when we come less prepared and more open to exploration. Instead of listing the exact activities, we invite parents to step into the session with a sense of curiosity and playfulness. Think of this as a mini retreat for your mind, where you can explore materials, textures, and artistic expression in ways you might not expect. Without any pre-planned notions, you'll be free to create intuitively and experience art as a process rather than an outcome.Why Join?\u00a0A chance for parents to engage in mindful creativity while their children immerse in exploratory play.\u00a0Activities that encourage self-expression, nature connection, and sensory engagement for both adults and kids.\u00a0A relaxed and inspiring environment that fosters creativity and bonding\u2022",
