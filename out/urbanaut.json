    "description": "This is our walk in one of the oldest suburbs of the \"old Bangalore\". Join us on a 'darshan' of the many temples and other religious institutes that dot this area as we narrate to you its origins and about the celebrities/personalities who called it their 'home'. Also on this walk learn more about the Maratha connection to this neighborhood as well as how a philanthropist not only helped renovate the Kadu Malleswara temple but also helped create an entire lake in the days gone by.See how Kadu Malleswara turned into a \"Mall-e-swarm\" and is fast losing not only it's heritage structures but also its local culture. In between all the bytes of history we take bites from an iconic eatery in the this area.So join us on this walk next and get to know Malleswaram in a completely new light.",
