    "description": "Welcome to our Women's Embodied Retreat at the Studio.The aim of the event is to help us remember something that we often forget - that we are nature, we are the cycles, we are the different phases and seasons, and that we are connected with the world in deeply profound ways than we recognise. When we live in sync, harmony and connection with these inner cycles, we live in harmony with ourselves and the world around us.This Women\u2019s Day Weekend, reconnect with your innate cycles and rhythms through movement, reflection, and sisterhood. Our journey together will honour the profound connection between our bodies and nature\u2014embracing the seasons within us and celebrating the wisdom they bring.Event DescriptionThrough a dynamic empowerment flow led by Franzi and a deeply reflective women\u2019s circle facilitated by Sanjana, we create space for self-awareness, healing, and transformation. A special first bleed ceremony will honour our journeys, allowing us to shift the narrative from shame to celebration and embrace the wisdom we carry.The event will begin with a grounding meditation and intention-setting practice guided by Sanjana, helping us connect with the feminine and prepare for the experience ahead.Franziska will be guiding you through an Empowerment Flow, a dynamic practice blending yoga with self-expression to unlock deeper truths within you. This method moves beyond traditional poses, inviting you to use movement, writing, art, and dialogue to explore your inner landscape and promote self-discovery.Next a facilitated women\u2019s circle will provide a sacred space for shared experiences, journaling, and discussions on living in harmony with our natural cycles.Cacao Ceremony - Franziska invites you to a heart-opening cacao ceremony for women.
