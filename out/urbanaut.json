Instead of practiced introductions, you\u2019ll make something with your hands. Instead of awkward questions, there\u2019ll be art, shared silences, small jokes, and the comfort of being around kind people.Come alone. Leave with a page, a memory, or a feeling you can\u2019t quite explain yet.No pressure. No labels. Let art do the talking - the rest can happen between the lines.The space will be gently held and facilitated by Your Journal Project (Yukti).You\u2019ll get: all art materials & thoughtful curiosity-led promptsYou\u2019ll take: your artwork, a new third place to quietly call home, and maybe a date\u2026 or at the very least, a friend.NOTE: \u20b9200 cover fully redeemable on F&B at the venue.",

Different backgrounds, different stories, one shared meal. The crowd is balanced, open minded, and there by choice, not chance. No loud networking. No awkward icebreakers. Just good food, unforced conversations, and the kind of listening that rarely happens in daily life.The restaurants are carefully chosen. Comfortable, well loved spaces where you can settle in and talk without rushing. The focus is not on the menu alone, but on the atmosphere that allows connection to unfold naturally.Some nights are light and playful. Some go deeper than expected. Some surprise you quietly. That is the point.StepOut Dinners are not about dating or outcomes. They are about discovery. Showing up. Sitting down. Letting the table do its quiet work.Sometimes, all it takes is one seat at the right table for life to feel a little more open. For more information, visit www.stepout.world",

Natasha studies motherhood, mental load, and what actually makes healthy, long-term partnerships work. The playshop is based on Eve Rodsky\u2019s bestselling Fair Play book and method, a globally recognised system used by couples to re-balance household labour and reclaim time, creativity, and sanity.Natasha\u2019s approach is bold, evidence-informed, and deeply human. She believes navigating the mental load is a journey, not a judgment, and that conversations about shared labour are one of the most important and intimate forms of care. This playshop is a soft launch into that journey, and a powerful experience for couples who believe that romantic partnerships are sustained by more than candlelight dinners and Netflix and Chill. \ud83d\ude42",

Cannot stop tinkering. Paints, draws, makes prints, throws pots, now learning to knit - all self-taught, all slightly obsessive. Writes occasionally on Substack when thoughts refuse to leave.Duration: 3 hoursThe material for the workshop is included in the ticket. Age 12+",

    "description": "\u200bMany of us grew up learning to think of land as a resource; a resource to be managed. This way of thinking about land was seen as neutral and practical. We were taught by well-intentioned geography teachers to studiously mark out on political maps of India, where we might find coal, bauxite and iron with little triangles, circles and squares.\u200bBut what does that framing leave out?\u200bAcross many cultures and times, land has not been understood as inert or separate, but as alive, animate. In these understandings, humans were active participants in the conditions that allowed life to thrive in the lands they lived on. Research and lived histories increasingly suggest, for example, that the supposedly pristine, untouched Amazonian Rainforest was in fact shaped by humans over thousands of years. It is the same story closer to home with Adivasis and nomadic pastoralists having profoundly shaped landscapes that we see as wild.\u200bWhile such forms of intimacy with the land may feel distant for many of us with urban lives today, our disconnection from land, seeing it as object, seeing it as resource than living presence, is a very, very recent phenomenon in our long human story.\u200bWithout romanticizing realities we may never have known, this gathering invites us to explore connections we may have forgotten and longings that are waiting to be discovered.Because we have limited spots - please register only if you can really be there!",

    "description": "Designing a Life That Fits (Now) is a gentle, in-person guided reflection for women who feel ready to pause and listen inward. This is a quiet space to notice what no longer fits in your life and to explore, without pressure, what you may be ready to design differently.This is not a traditional workshop or class. There\u2019s nothing to fix, achieve, or perform. Instead, you\u2019ll be guided through reflective prompts and moments of stillness that invite honesty, clarity, and self-connection. In a small, supportive group setting, you\u2019ll have the chance to slow down, step out of daily noise, and reconnect with what feels true for you right now.You don\u2019t need prior experience, answers, or a plan\u2014just a willingness to show up as you are. You\u2019ll leave feeling grounded, clearer, and more attuned to what matters most, carrying insights you can return to in your own time.",
