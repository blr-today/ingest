This workshop explores how releasing tension in the psoas can free us from long-held patterns, both physical and mental, that stem from the past.Aligned with the Jivamukti Focus of the Month, \u201cWhat\u2019s Inside Memory,\u201d we\u2019ll reflect on how the body holds echoes of past experiences and explore how mindful psoas stretching and backbending can help dissolve those imprints. Through a combination of anatomical insight, guided movement, and breath work, you\u2019ll learn how to stabilize and expand into heart-opening backbends that cultivate liberation and presence.Join us for this journey to discover what lies within the psoas\u2014and how unlocking it can open the heart and release the memories that keep us tethered to the past.",

We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table**Tickets are for entry and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter.
