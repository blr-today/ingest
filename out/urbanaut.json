    "description": "Have You Ever Experienced Dining in a Traditional Bohra Thaal?If not, here\u2019s your chance to be part of an intimate and one-of-a-kind home dining experience. Hosted in the comfort of a warm, welcoming home, this gathering brings together like-minded individuals to share a meal, exchange stories, and turn strangers into friends\u2014all while indulging in the rich flavors of Bohra cuisine.Bohra cuisine originates from the Bohra Muslim community, with roots tracing back to Yemen before flourishing in India.

Disconnect from devices for 3 hours of unplugged experience\u2014we'll have books, board games, music, crochet, and of course, food! But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!Meet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).We will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.Embrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age! **Strictly no devices (no laptops, ipads, and you will be asked to keep your phone in a basket or in your bag- not in your pocket and no where on a table. E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter. Do not purchase a ticket if you are unwilling to surrender your devices for 3 hours.",

    "description": "For ages 16 and abovewhere you from:So tell me, where are you from, now that you're here?Are you from earth's kernels, or a childhood lane?Are you from a summer of love, or your innate politics?Are you from where they say you're from, or have you yet to find out?Where You From?About the show:This genre-defining show offers glimpses into the changing identities of a body in continued performance. Bringing cliff notes from a decade-long practice in creating works of words, Nupur Azadi - a slam poet who emerged from Singapore - shows what is possible when meditations in movement, voicework, spoken word, and theatrical traditions come together.-65-minute, devised-solo told in fours acts, without intermission.-Multi-disciplinary and multi-media show suitable for audiences 16+.-This show is part of the A Decade of Theatrical Poetry celebration and was first shown during BLR Hubba in December 2024. It was followed by Jagriti Theatre in February 2025 and Sabha BLR in June 2025.\u00a0About the artist:Nupur Azadi (she/her) is an international stage artist who creates works of words. She is a self-taught, multi-disciplinary artist who emerged from the close-knit slam poetry spaces of Singapore in 2015. Her work has been hailed as \u2018urgent\u2019 and \u2018engaging\u2019 by a global audience. In 2022 she conceptualized, wrote, produced, directed, and performed in a one-woman theatrical poetry show called \u2018Live. Love. Loaf. An investigation into who gets to loiter\u2019. Over 2022 and 2023 she performed the same across various venues in Bangalore and NALSAR, Hyderabad before taking it to Singapore and Cambodia. As a student of Voicework, and of literary pedagogies, and a continued participant in movement arts learnings, she labors over foraging a physicality to the previously textual genre of spoken word. She intertwines spoken word, theatre, music, and movement into an art form she christened Theatrical Poetry.Read reviews: \"When Nupur speaks, you listen. What a performance!\" -Vasu Dixit\u00a0\"Met so many women and their stories in one tonight\"\u00a0- Sal Yusuf\"Found a whole new genre in this show.\"\u00a0- Damini Gairola\"Azadi at her courageous best!\"\u00a0- Dipankar Panth",

Curated by the acclaimed Chef Anumitra Ghosh Dastidar, the menu explores four distinct ramen styles, each rooted in a specific part of Japan and its culinary philosophy.Expect a deep dive into process, purpose, and provenance \u2014 with bowls ranging from temple-inspired vegan ramen to the rich tonkotsu classics of Hakata. This is ramen as it's meant to be: soulful, seasonal, and full of stories.\ud83c\udf5c The Ramen Map is here.One night. Four bowls. Four journeys across Japan.Bento Bento presents an exclusive ramen experience curated by Chef Anumitra Ghosh Dastidar, known for her fearless and deeply researched East Asian cooking. From Kyoto\u2019s vegan temple cuisine to the street-smart brothless Mazemen, each bowl is rooted in regional tradition \u2014 and reinterpreted for the Bangalore monsoon.Each bowl on this special menu is inspired by a region of Japan and its unique ramen style. From temple kitchens to snowy alleys to post-war Tokyo innovations\u2014every dish has a story.1. Temple Ramen \u2013 Kyoto\u00a0(Vegan) 550 Rooted in the centuries-old traditions of\u00a0sh\u014djin ry\u014dri\u2014Buddhist temple cuisine\u2014this is a serene, vegan ramen crafted to reflect Kyoto\u2019s spiritual and seasonal sensitivity. The broth is layered with fermented elements, seaweed, and umami-rich ingredients, offering complexity without any animal products. A meditative, almost sacred bowl designed for Bangalore\u2019s vegetarian community.2. Tonkotsu Ramen \u2013 Hakata, Kyushu\u00a0(Pork) 550 From Japan\u2019s southern island comes the quintessential street ramen. The tonkotsu broth, slow-simmered for hours from pork bones, is intensely creamy and collagen-rich. Topped with chashu pork, black garlic oil, and thin Hakata-style noodles, this bowl is deeply satisfying and bold\u2014a nod to the high-energy ramen stalls of Fukuoka.3. Miso Ramen \u2013 Sapporo, Hokkaido\u00a0(Chicken) 550 Cold winters demand warm bowls. This ramen, inspired by Sapporo\u2019s classic miso version, is made with a chicken and soy base fortified with miso paste. Finished with charred corn, saut\u00e9ed bean sprouts, soft-boiled egg, and grilled chicken, this comforting bowl is perfect for monsoon days in Bangalore.4. Mazemen \u2013 Kyoto x Nagoya x Chef\u2019s Remix\u00a0(Brothless) 550 Mazemen is ramen without broth but with double the intensity. Thick noodles are tossed in soy tare, chili oil, pickled vegetables, and sharp aromatics. While inspired by Kyoto\u2019s simplicity and Nagoya\u2019s street-savvy flair, Chef Anumitra\u2019s version introduces her own cross-regional playfulness.

From Kyoto\u2019s vegan temple cuisine to the street-smart brothless Mazemen, each bowl is rooted in regional tradition \u2014 and reinterpreted for the Bangalore monsoon.Each bowl on this special menu is inspired by a region of Japan and its unique ramen style. From temple kitchens to snowy alleys to post-war Tokyo innovations\u2014every dish has a story.1.

The pieces presented are learned from Kalamandalam Chandrika, a direct disciple of Chinnammu Amma, and are carried through the embodied memories of two women dancers.Rooted in tradition yet deeply personal, this performance honors a forgotten lineage in Mohiniyattam. It brings visibility to Chinnammu Amma\u2019s legacy while also acknowledging the continued influence of Amith\u2019s teachers, Nirmala Paniker and Kalamandalam Chandrika. Through this recital, Amith opens a space to reflect on the form\u2019s history, memory, and transmission.Vocal: Rohith AneeshNattuvangam: Sreenima N P.Amith K.Amith K is a scholar, dancer, and choreographer with a PhD from Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. His work explores the intersections of caste, culture, and history in modern Kerala, with writings on gender, dance, and society.

    "description": "Samyoga \u2013 Khayal Se Kriti TakA unique confluence of Hindustani and Carnatic musical traditionsSamyoga \u2013 meaning union or coming together \u2013 is an evocative musical production that intricately weaves together the rich threads of India\u2019s two great classical traditions: Hindustani and Carnatic music. Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), Samyoga is a celebration of both the shared roots and the distinctive aesthetics of these traditions. This presentation of Samyoga will be an unplugged, voice-only exploration, where two voices come together, accompanied by live tanpuras to create an immersive and meditative musical experience.Traversing the expanse of Indian music, the concert explores genres ranging from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotional depth of Bhakti Sangeet, and from the emotive beauty of Thumri and Jawali to the dramatic expressiveness of Natyasangeet. Each piece is carefully curated to highlight both the convergence and divergence in approach, structure, and emotion across the two systems.Through a seamless blend of performance and narration, Samyoga offers audiences more than just a concert\u2014it presents a musical journey, providing insights into the evolution, nuances, and interconnections between genres.\u00a0Interestingly, both Radhika and Manasi are alumni of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who chose to follow their hearts into the world of music. Today, they are recognised not only as accomplished performers but also as dedicated researchers in the field of Indian music.\u00a0",

    "description": "At different points in life, we often feel pulled in many directions.The desire for freedom and independence.The longing to belong and connect.The quiet inner nudge to grow, shift, or heal.In this reflective Zuva Life experience, guided by master practitioner Ragini Rao (Infinum Growth), we\u2019ll gently explore these three lifelong forces\u2014Autonomy, Homonomy, and Physis\u2014through Transactional Analysis.Ragini Rao is a Teaching and Supervising Transactional Analyst TSTA(P). She trains and supervises advanced training groups in Transactional Analysis to become Psychotherapists, Coaches and Trainers. With over 5000 hours of one-on-one and group counselling and therapy, over a span of 30 years, she has addressed problems pertaining to Relationships, Marital Issues, Depression, Grief, Low Self Esteem and Sexual, Verbal and Physical Abuse. Ragini is also a licensed workshop leader for the \u201cHeal your Life\u201d programs based on the philosophy of world renowned author Louise L. Hay. She conducts the Heal Your Life workshops in offline settings.Expect a mix of personal reflection, creative expression, group conversations, and playful tools that help you notice:When do I crave independence?Where do I feel most connected to others?What parts of me are ready to grow or change?This isn\u2019t about fixing or solving anything. It\u2019s about pausing, noticing, and gently mapping your own \u201ctug of three.\u201dNo prior experience with Transactional Analysis needed\u2014just bring your curiosity.",

    "description": "Women have a complicated relationship with money.And it starts early.Many families shield their daughters from anything related to \u2018finance\u2019, but this well meaning protection ends up being a disservice. For when these young women step into the real world, they lack the confidence to make financial decisions -\u00a0not because they\u2019re incapable, but because they were never given information on budgeting, savings and investments.Later in life, many continue to rely on their partners for investment decisions. This dependency on others will only stop when they have the right information and toolkit to take back control.That\u2019s is where we come in.After two 'In Her Interest' pilots we've realised that what women need is a safe, private space to talk money - where no question is too small or too basic.We launch 'In Her Interest' on Saturday, July 26th in Bangalore and will focus on one core idea for the launch:Building financial security for women.The session at WeWork 37 Cunningham, will be led by two amazing experts who truly get it.Sonia Shenoy - Business news journalist and host of 'The Money Mindset'.Hansi Mehrotra - CFA and Founder of 'The Money Hans'This session is on Owning Your Money, and the key areas we cover are:Philosophy of Money - Understand the fundamentals of money and the importance of building security before building wealth.Investing 101 - How to grow your wealth through Investing. We deep dive into the different kinds of investments aswell - fixed income, mutual funds, equity, active and passive investing and asset allocation.Session goalsSimplify money conceptsBust common financial mythsBuild your confidence in making financial decisionsNo jargon, just real talk.Note: Each session is theme based, this session is about 'Owning Your Money' - we are not talking stocks and shares.",
