    "description": "Madhuragati - Every step in Odissi resounds with the sweetness of a cultural aesthetic formed over centuries of aspiration for a higher goal.. To celebrate the beauty of this exquisite dance form arising from the life and beliefs of the people of forgone times till now.\u00a0Anoushka will perform dance works that showcase a range of possibilities highlighting the sculptural and expressive qualities of the Odissi style.The performance features five pieces, seamlessly connected by brief introductory interludes. This carefully crafted format offers an engaging experience for the audience, guiding them through the beauty of the Odissi classical dance form. Originally a sacred ritual dedicated to the gods, Odissi is one of the oldest dance traditions in the world. Odissi speaks of love and union, between the human and divine, transporting viewers to enchanted worlds of magic and spirituality. Its sensuous and lyrical grace reflects both the motifs of Odisha temple sculpture as well as the poetry from the deep wellsprings of Odia music.Anoushka Rahman, disciple of Guru Surupa Sen, is the new soloist and emerging star of The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.She started her Odissi journey with Smt.Dona Ganguly in Kolkata and holds a Sangeet Bhaskar in Odissi dance and a postgraduate degree in Mathematics.Her association with Nrityagram began in 2018 through a Summer Workshop, which paved the way for advanced training under the guidance of Surupa Sen and Pavithra Reddy.\u00a0Recognised for her talent and dedication, she was awarded the Virendra Kumar Laroia Fellowship. She has performed with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble across India, the US, Canada and Sri Lanka and was presented in a solo debut performance in November 2024.\u00a0At present, Anoushka is a dancer with The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble.ChoreographyGuru Kelucharan Mohapatra (Sun Maiyy\u0101)Surupa SenMusic CompositionPt.

E-books are allowed)**Tickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter.

    "description": "For ages 16 and abovewhere you from:So tell me, where are you from, now that you're here?Are you from earth's kernels, or a childhood lane?Are you from a summer of love, or your innate politics?Are you from where they say you're from, or have you yet to find out?Where You From?About the show:This genre-defining show offers glimpses into the changing identities of a body in continued performance. Bringing cliff notes from a decade-long practice in creating works of words, Nupur Azadi - a slam poet who emerged from Singapore - shows what is possible when meditations in movement, voicework, spoken word, and theatrical traditions come together.-65-minute, devised-solo told in fours acts, without intermission.-Multi-disciplinary and multi-media show suitable for audiences 16+.-This show is part of the A Decade of Theatrical Poetry celebration and was first shown during BLR Hubba in December 2024. It was followed by Jagriti Theatre in February 2025 and Sabha BLR in June 2025.\u00a0About the artist:Nupur Azadi (she/her) is an international stage artist who creates works of words. She is a self-taught, multi-disciplinary artist who emerged from the close-knit slam poetry spaces of Singapore in 2015. Her work has been hailed as \u2018urgent\u2019 and \u2018engaging\u2019 by a global audience. In 2022 she conceptualized, wrote, produced, directed, and performed in a one-woman theatrical poetry show called \u2018Live. Love. Loaf. An investigation into who gets to loiter\u2019. Over 2022 and 2023 she performed the same across various venues in Bangalore and NALSAR, Hyderabad before taking it to Singapore and Cambodia. As a student of Voicework, and of literary pedagogies, and a continued participant in movement arts learnings, she labors over foraging a physicality to the previously textual genre of spoken word. She intertwines spoken word, theatre, music, and movement into an art form she christened Theatrical Poetry.Read reviews: \"When Nupur speaks, you listen. What a performance!\" -Vasu Dixit\u00a0\"Met so many women and their stories in one tonight\"\u00a0- Sal Yusuf\"Found a whole new genre in this show.\"\u00a0- Damini Gairola\"Azadi at her courageous best!\"\u00a0- Dipankar Panth",

    "description": "Bento Bento presents: The Ramen Map \u2013 A Regional Ramen Experience by Chef AnumitraJoin us on July 19th, as Bento Bento launches The Ramen Map \u2014 a limited-time ramen-led dining experience celebrating Japan\u2019s regional noodle culture. Curated by the acclaimed Chef Anumitra Ghosh Dastidar, the menu explores four distinct ramen styles, each rooted in a specific part of Japan and its culinary philosophy.Expect a deep dive into process, purpose, and provenance \u2014 with bowls ranging from temple-inspired vegan ramen to the rich tonkotsu classics of Hakata. This is ramen as it's meant to be: soulful, seasonal, and full of stories.\ud83c\udf5c The Ramen Map is here.One night. Four bowls. Four journeys across Japan.Bento Bento presents an exclusive ramen experience curated by Chef Anumitra Ghosh Dastidar, known for her fearless and deeply researched East Asian cooking. From Kyoto\u2019s vegan temple cuisine to the street-smart brothless Mazemen, each bowl is rooted in regional tradition \u2014 and reinterpreted for the Bangalore monsoon.Each bowl on this special menu is inspired by a region of Japan and its unique ramen style. From temple kitchens to snowy alleys to post-war Tokyo innovations\u2014every dish has a story.1. Temple Ramen \u2013 Kyoto\u00a0(Vegan) Rooted in the centuries-old traditions of\u00a0sh\u014djin ry\u014dri\u2014Buddhist temple cuisine\u2014this is a serene, vegan ramen crafted to reflect Kyoto\u2019s spiritual and seasonal sensitivity. The broth is layered with fermented elements, seaweed, and umami-rich ingredients, offering complexity without any animal products. A meditative, almost sacred bowl designed for Bangalore\u2019s vegetarian community.2. Tonkotsu Ramen \u2013 Hakata, Kyushu\u00a0(Pork) From Japan\u2019s southern island comes the quintessential street ramen. The tonkotsu broth, slow-simmered for hours from pork bones, is intensely creamy and collagen-rich. Topped with chashu pork, black garlic oil, and thin Hakata-style noodles, this bowl is deeply satisfying and bold\u2014a nod to the high-energy ramen stalls of Fukuoka.3. Miso Ramen \u2013 Sapporo, Hokkaido\u00a0(Chicken) Cold winters demand warm bowls. This ramen, inspired by Sapporo\u2019s classic miso version, is made with a chicken and soy base fortified with miso paste. Finished with charred corn, saut\u00e9ed bean sprouts, soft-boiled egg, and grilled chicken, this comforting bowl is perfect for monsoon days in Bangalore.4. Mazemen \u2013 Kyoto x Nagoya x Chef\u2019s Remix\u00a0(Brothless) Mazemen is ramen without broth but with double the intensity. Thick noodles are tossed in soy tare, chili oil, pickled vegetables, and sharp aromatics. While inspired by Kyoto\u2019s simplicity and Nagoya\u2019s street-savvy flair, Chef Anumitra\u2019s version introduces her own cross-regional playfulness. A dish for those who enjoy texture and punch.SIDES & ADD-ONSTo round off the meal, Bento Bento will also offer a line-up of Japanese small plates designed to accompany the ramen bowls:Vegetarian OptionsSunomono Salad (Vegan):\u00a0Cucumber, carrot, wakame seaweedCorn & Radish Leaf Onigiri:\u00a0Lightly grilled rice ballsAssorted Vegetable Tempura:\u00a0Served with tentsuyu dipping sauceNon-Vegetarian OptionsSunomono Salad (Seafood):\u00a0Crabsticks, wakame, cucumber, carrotPrawn Tempura:\u00a0Light and crisp with wasabi mayoChicken Nanban:\u00a0Fried chicken glazed in tangy sauce, served with tartarDessertDorayaki:\u00a0Classic Japanese pancake sandwich with sweet red bean filling\u2014a nostalgic Tokyo street snack WHY THIS MATTERS NOWAs Bangalore\u2019s food scene becomes increasingly global, ramen has emerged as a city-wide obsession. But few know the\u00a0regional soul\u00a0behind these bowls. The Ramen Map aims to offer context\u2014not just carbs. It\u2019s for eaters who care about origin, for diners seeking more than just trend.It\u2019s also a celebration of cross-cultural cooking\u2014of how Japanese food, when done right, can be soulful and satisfying in the Indian context.

From Kyoto\u2019s vegan temple cuisine to the street-smart brothless Mazemen, each bowl is rooted in regional tradition \u2014 and reinterpreted for the Bangalore monsoon.Each bowl on this special menu is inspired by a region of Japan and its unique ramen style. From temple kitchens to snowy alleys to post-war Tokyo innovations\u2014every dish has a story.1. Temple Ramen \u2013 Kyoto\u00a0(Vegan) Rooted in the centuries-old traditions of\u00a0sh\u014djin ry\u014dri\u2014Buddhist temple cuisine\u2014this is a serene, vegan ramen crafted to reflect Kyoto\u2019s spiritual and seasonal sensitivity. The broth is layered with fermented elements, seaweed, and umami-rich ingredients, offering complexity without any animal products. A meditative, almost sacred bowl designed for Bangalore\u2019s vegetarian community.2. Tonkotsu Ramen \u2013 Hakata, Kyushu\u00a0(Pork) From Japan\u2019s southern island comes the quintessential street ramen. The tonkotsu broth, slow-simmered for hours from pork bones, is intensely creamy and collagen-rich. Topped with chashu pork, black garlic oil, and thin Hakata-style noodles, this bowl is deeply satisfying and bold\u2014a nod to the high-energy ramen stalls of Fukuoka.3. Miso Ramen \u2013 Sapporo, Hokkaido\u00a0(Chicken) Cold winters demand warm bowls. This ramen, inspired by Sapporo\u2019s classic miso version, is made with a chicken and soy base fortified with miso paste. Finished with charred corn, saut\u00e9ed bean sprouts, soft-boiled egg, and grilled chicken, this comforting bowl is perfect for monsoon days in Bangalore.4. Mazemen \u2013 Kyoto x Nagoya x Chef\u2019s Remix\u00a0(Brothless) Mazemen is ramen without broth but with double the intensity. Thick noodles are tossed in soy tare, chili oil, pickled vegetables, and sharp aromatics. While inspired by Kyoto\u2019s simplicity and Nagoya\u2019s street-savvy flair, Chef Anumitra\u2019s version introduces her own cross-regional playfulness. A dish for those who enjoy texture and punch.SIDES & ADD-ONSTo round off the meal, Bento Bento will also offer a line-up of Japanese small plates designed to accompany the ramen bowls:Vegetarian OptionsSunomono Salad (Vegan):\u00a0Cucumber, carrot, wakame seaweedCorn & Radish Leaf Onigiri:\u00a0Lightly grilled rice ballsAssorted Vegetable Tempura:\u00a0Served with tentsuyu dipping sauceNon-Vegetarian OptionsSunomono Salad (Seafood):\u00a0Crabsticks, wakame, cucumber, carrotPrawn Tempura:\u00a0Light and crisp with wasabi mayoChicken Nanban:\u00a0Fried chicken glazed in tangy sauce, served with tartarDessertDorayaki:\u00a0Classic Japanese pancake sandwich with sweet red bean filling\u2014a nostalgic Tokyo street snack WHY THIS MATTERS NOWAs Bangalore\u2019s food scene becomes increasingly global, ramen has emerged as a city-wide obsession. But few know the\u00a0regional soul\u00a0behind these bowls. The Ramen Map aims to offer context\u2014not just carbs. It\u2019s for eaters who care about origin, for diners seeking more than just trend.It\u2019s also a celebration of cross-cultural cooking\u2014of how Japanese food, when done right, can be soulful and satisfying in the Indian context.

The pieces presented are learned from Kalamandalam Chandrika, a direct disciple of Chinnammu Amma, and are carried through the embodied memories of two women dancers.Rooted in tradition yet deeply personal, this performance honors a forgotten lineage in Mohiniyattam. It brings visibility to Chinnammu Amma\u2019s legacy while also acknowledging the continued influence of Amith\u2019s teachers, Nirmala Paniker and Kalamandalam Chandrika. Through this recital, Amith opens a space to reflect on the form\u2019s history, memory, and transmission.Vocal: Rohith AneeshNattuvangam: Sreenima N P.Amith K.Amith K is a scholar, dancer, and choreographer with a PhD from Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. His work explores the intersections of caste, culture, and history in modern Kerala, with writings on gender, dance, and society. Through Mohiniyattam, he challenges hierarchies within the art world, blending scholarship and performance.",

    "description": "Samyoga \u2013 Khayal Se Kriti TakA unique confluence of Hindustani and Carnatic musical traditionsSamyoga \u2013 meaning union or coming together \u2013 is an evocative musical production that intricately weaves together the rich threads of India\u2019s two great classical traditions: Hindustani and Carnatic music. Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), Samyoga is a celebration of both the shared roots and the distinctive aesthetics of these traditions. This presentation of Samyoga will be an unplugged, voice-only exploration, where two voices come together, accompanied by live tanpuras to create an immersive and meditative musical experience.Traversing the expanse of Indian music, the concert explores genres ranging from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotional depth of Bhakti Sangeet, and from the emotive beauty of Thumri and Jawali to the dramatic expressiveness of Natyasangeet. Each piece is carefully curated to highlight both the convergence and divergence in approach, structure, and emotion across the two systems.Through a seamless blend of performance and narration, Samyoga offers audiences more than just a concert\u2014it presents a musical journey, providing insights into the evolution, nuances, and interconnections between genres.\u00a0Interestingly, both Radhika and Manasi are alumni of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who chose to follow their hearts into the world of music. Today, they are recognised not only as accomplished performers but also as dedicated researchers in the field of Indian music.\u00a0",

She trains and supervises advanced training groups in Transactional Analysis to become Psychotherapists, Coaches and Trainers. With over 5000 hours of one-on-one and group counselling and therapy, over a span of 30 years, she has addressed problems pertaining to Relationships, Marital Issues, Depression, Grief, Low Self Esteem and Sexual, Verbal and Physical Abuse.

She conducts the Heal Your Life workshops in offline settings.Expect a mix of personal reflection, creative expression, group conversations, and playful tools that help you notice:When do I crave independence?Where do I feel most connected to others?What parts of me are ready to grow or change?This isn\u2019t about fixing or solving anything. It\u2019s about pausing, noticing, and gently mapping your own \u201ctug of three.\u201dNo prior experience with Transactional Analysis needed\u2014just bring your curiosity.",
