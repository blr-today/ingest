    "description": "Do you feel tired in your body, but unable to truly slow down?Tired & Wired is a 90-minute, slow and supportive experience designed for those moments when rest feels distant and the nervous system feels overstimulated. This workshop offers a gentle pause - to settle, ground, and reconnect with yourself.Through soft yoga movement, calming breath awareness, and reflective journaling, we\u2019ll create space for the body to unwind and the mind to soften. The session is slow-paced, choice-based, and beginner-friendly, with no pressure to perform or push.The intention is not to \u201cfix\u201d anything, but to listen, slow down, and leave feeling more settled and present.No prior yoga or journaling experience is required.You\u2019re welcome exactly as you are.

    "description": "About the showThis is an unscripted comedy show where you witness audience suggestions turn into fun, playful, and gripping stories live on stage.Watch performers use their sharp instincts to step into characters, evolve story arcs, and build worlds, often finding big laughs and unexpected emotional turns along the way. With no scripts and nothing planned, every show exists only once.The Extra // Ordinary show isn\u2019t just about exaggerating the ordinary. It\u2019s about letting the ordinary take up space, stretching it, sitting with it, and following it wherever it naturally leads. Sometimes that becomes funny, sometimes absurd, and sometimes extraordinarily human.Suitable for ages 13+. May include occasional strong language and mature themes. Parental guidance advised.About COOPCOOP (Council of Ordinary People) is a Bengaluru-grown troupe of improvisers that does not hesitate to push the boundaries of improv beyond punchlines. We are creating a space where we use improv for collective storytelling with more depth and narrative range. The members previously performed shows in Bengaluru across venues like Underground Comedy Club, Vyoma Artspace, Atta Galatta, Bloom Creative Zone, NID Bangalore, Drunkling",

Along the way, she learns to savour pleasure, sit with stillness, and open herself to love, all while discovering what it truly means to feel whole again.Equal parts comforting and introspective, it\u2019s a film about slowing down, listening inward, and allowing life to unfold, one meal, one moment, one place at a time.Paired with a thoughtfully prepared three-course dinner by Chef Rhea Aaron and wines from Wine in Progress, it\u2019s an easy, feel-good way to spend an evening outdoors, wrapped in food, film, and a little self-reflection.Terms and Conditions    The management is not responsible for any injury or damage that may occur during the event.

    "description": "About the play:The Prophet and the Poet is based on the exchange of letters and articles between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore over 25 years, with the Indian freedom struggle as the backdrop. The letters reveal how the two personalities differed significantly on the form and content of the freedom movement. The differences widened over the years. However, the depth of their personalities maintained genuine respect for each other in spite of deep differences on ideological grounds. It reflected the political maturity of those times in India. Bangalore Little Theatre was privileged to be invited to stage the opening shows of the play at the places hallowed by Gandhi and Tagore in their lifetime \u2013 Sabarmati Ashram, Santiniketan (Visva Bharati) and Jorasanko in Kolkata. The Kolkata performance was at the courtyard stage of Thakurbadi, the Tagore ancestral home, now a heritage site looked after by Rabindra Bharati University. On the occasion of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s birth anniversary, the play was staged at the Raj Bhavan, Bangalore, with the President of India in attendance. Later, the play was performed by invitation in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh, as part of the India-Bangladesh Joint Celebrations of Tagore\u2019s 150th birth anniversary. Prasar Bharati commissioned a tele-film of the play. The film was telecast several times over Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti. There have been about 130 performances of the play since its opening. The play has generated much interestoutside India as well. It has had two American productions, one in Houston and the other at the University of Iowa. Productions in UK and Ireland are also planned. A highly successful tour of Trinidad & Tobago was followed by performances in Singapore, co-hosted by Tagore Society and the Indian High Commission. The play was invited to Sydney for celebrations of Gandhi\u2019s 150th birth anniversary. An enriching experience ... Times of India, KolkataEnthralled ...

    "name": "In the Morning Light feat. Navya & Karthik",
    "description": "In the Morning Light is a concert series hosted at Ram\u2019s Musique Experience, designed for unhurried listening in the quiet hours of the day. Curated as morning performances, the series invites audiences to experience music with attention, calm, and presence \u2014 before the noise of the day sets in.This edition of In the Morning Light features sitar artist Navya Rudrappa, accompanied by Karthik Bhat.Navya Rudrappa is known for her thoughtful, grounded approach to the sitar, drawing from Indian classical traditions while allowing space for reflection and subtle exploration. Her performances emphasise patience, tonal depth, and the natural unfolding of musical ideas \u2014 making her work especially resonant in an intimate morning setting.Accompanied by Karthik Bhat, the concert is shaped as a dialogue rather than a display \u2014 allowing rhythm, silence, and resonance to coexist. The focus remains on attentive listening, where the music is given time to breathe and settle.In the Morning Light is not about spectacle or volume. It is about beginning the day with intention \u2014 through music that unfolds slowly and stays with you.",
