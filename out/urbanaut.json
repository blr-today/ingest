    "description": "\u2018Without our breath nothing else would have any importance whatsoever; in fact we would not even exist.\u2019 \u2013 FM AlexanderIn this workshop, we will explore theories and practices of breathing from the Alexander Technique and the Oxygen Advantage\u00ae Method. Breathing is normally an automatic process but by learning to bring conscious awareness and direction to it, we can promote greater ease and expansion throughout the breath and life processes.Some of the lenses we will explore include biomechanics (where in your body you breathe from/with), biochemistry (how your breath changes the internal organization of your body) and biorhythms (different patterns and rates of breathing and how they affect you). Using light movements, various postures and awareness-based practices, you will be guided to explore new ways of breathing and sensing yourself. The more possibilities we create in our frameworks, the more our breathing becomes effortless integrated and aligned with our everyday needs.This workshop will offer you simple tools that you can bring into your life for a fuller and livelier breathing experience. Join us for a gentle and exploratory journey into your breath and bodily patterns.Note: Practices will be done both seated and lying down. If you have any mobility restrictions, please let us know so that we can accommodate you.About your facilitators:Dayita Nereyeth is an Alexander Technique teacher dancer and editor.

The story follows Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung), two neighbors who discover that their spouses are having an affair with each other. As they spend time together, they form a deep and complex bond, trying to understand their own feelings while maintaining propriety in a conservative society.Despite their growing affection, they decide not to act on their emotions, fearing to become like their unfaithful partners. The film is a masterful exploration of love, longing, and missed opportunities, beautifully captured through lush cinematography, atmospheric music, and the lingering tension between two people bound by circumstance yet separated by societal norms and personal restraint.3-Course Dinner MenuCourse 1: Veggie rice paper rolls with peanut sauceCourse 2: (Veg) Cantonese soy sauce fried noodles served with sauteed bok choy, oyster mushroom and broccoli(Non Veg) Cantonese soy sauce fried noodles served with 5 spice roast chickenCourse 3:Coconut pannacotta with passion fruit______Terms and Conditions:The management is not responsible for any injury or damage that may occur during the event.No liability or claims arising from the consumption or intake of any food or drink will be entertained by the management.Parking near the event premises is at the risk of the vehicle owner.Valet service is available at a charge of Rs. 200 per vehicle.Photographs and videos of ticket holders may be uploaded to social media.
