By consciously connecting the inhale and exhale without pause, practitioners tap into the body's innate wisdom, unlocking stored emotions and releasing tension held within the subconscious mind.Here's Maria's message:\" In this Breathwork journey we'll open our hearts and reconnect with joy, fun, and happiness. As we step into the final two months of the year, we\u2019ll take a moment to acknowledge all we've been through and prepare ourselves for the most festive season ahead. Together, we'll create space to give and receive love, and embrace the remaining months with renewed energy and joy! We'll end with a powerful visualization meditation to call forth the best that this year still has to offer. \"",
