The pieces presented are learned from Kalamandalam Chandrika, a direct disciple of Chinnammu Amma, and are carried through the embodied memories of two women dancers.Rooted in tradition yet deeply personal, this performance honors a forgotten lineage in Mohiniyattam. It brings visibility to Chinnammu Amma\u2019s legacy while also acknowledging the continued influence of Amith\u2019s teachers, Nirmala Paniker and Kalamandalam Chandrika. Through this recital, Amith opens a space to reflect on the form\u2019s history, memory, and transmission.Vocal: Rohith AneeshNattuvangam: Sreenima N P.Amith K.Amith K is a scholar, dancer, and choreographer with a PhD from Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady.

Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), Samyoga is a celebration of both the shared roots and the distinctive aesthetics of these traditions. This presentation of Samyoga will be an unplugged, voice-only exploration, where two voices come together, accompanied by live tanpuras to create an immersive and meditative musical experience.Traversing the expanse of Indian music, the concert explores genres ranging from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotional depth of Bhakti Sangeet, and from the emotive beauty of Thumri and Jawali to the dramatic expressiveness of Natyasangeet. Each piece is carefully curated to highlight both the convergence and divergence in approach, structure, and emotion across the two systems.Through a seamless blend of performance and narration, Samyoga offers audiences more than just a concert\u2014it presents a musical journey, providing insights into the evolution, nuances, and interconnections between genres.\u00a0Interestingly, both Radhika and Manasi are alumni of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, who chose to follow their hearts into the world of music. Today, they are recognised not only as accomplished performers but also as dedicated researchers in the field of Indian music.\u00a0",

No big reveal.We head toward a hidden speakeasy, a tucked-away dream of surreal art, shared plates, and first drinks on us.Think hidden doors, dreamy cocktails, and stories that unfold over Burmese plates. Just a slow circle of strangers turning into something more. If you know, you\u2019ll feel it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll want to.Picture this :\ud83c\udf75 Caf\u00e9 whispers\ud83c\udfa8 Hidden doors\ud83c\udf78 Dreamy cocktails\ud83e\udd62 Burmese bites\ud83c\udf00 And strangers who won\u2019t stay strangers for longThis is not just an event.
