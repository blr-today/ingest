She\u2019s lived out of hostels, taken long detours, and found meaning in volunteering along the way. Her journeys are guided more by conversations than checklists. To her, travel is about finding the shared essence in the unfamiliar and returning with a deeper connection to the familiar.About the venueDialogues Cafe, Koramangala is known for creating spaces that enable meaningful conversations and a seamless experience. With several events hosted regularly, you\u2019ll have no trouble being guided to the beautiful glass house on the rooftop, where our gathering will take place. See you there! \ud83d\ude42",

It\u2019s not a workshop. And no one\u2019s going to ask you to \u201copen up\u201d if you don\u2019t want to.It\u2019s just a room full of guys who get it\u2014who\u2019ve also felt lost, burnt out, unsure of who they are outside of work or relationships, or just plain tired of pretending to have it all together.We\u2019ll talk about the stuff that doesn\u2019t usually come up\u2014pressure, failure, identity, and what it actually means to be a man right now. You can speak, or just listen. You\u2019ll leave feeling a little less alone, and maybe even a little lighter.No fixing. No judgement.

This is evident not only in the didactic approach, but also in the whole slowness, in the quantity of respect and in the enormous, insolent security of the work. That a director in 1990 could be so strong, so serious, so moral and so hopeful, is already beautiful.\" - Donald RichieAn episodic adventure from Akira Kurosawa following eight dream-y vignettes of a \"surrogate Kurosawa\", spanning across various themes internalized by the director. A cognitive rendition of Kurosawa's own dreams and memories, the anthology film bleeds from one dream segment to another creating a universe of its own.",

    "description": "Take a pause from the rush of life and enter a space of quiet presence with our Silent Hours, happening every alternate Tuesday. This is your invitation to retreat from the noise, slow down, and reconnect with yourself in a gentle, mindful way.In our cozy, peaceful studio, you\u2019re welcome to embrace stillness in a way that feels right for you, whether it\u2019s meditating, reading, journaling, breathing deeply, stretching on your mat, crocheting, or simply sitting in quiet reflection. Let this be a moment to unplug from screens and distractions, creating a shared atmosphere of calm where every breath and movement holds intention.If you wish to, you can extend this practice into a silent, mindful dinner in our dining space. Eating in silence offers a beautiful way to slow down, savour each bite with full awareness, and deepen your connection to the present moment. Whether you dine solo or share this experience with a loved one, it\u2019s a grounding and peaceful close to your evening.The Silent Hour then gently transitions into a sharing circle, where we come together to reflect, express, and connect before we part ways.Come as you are, and allow yourself this simple yet profound gift of presence. \ud83d\udc9bKindly note, its mandatory for participants need to handover the phone and any other multi-media gadgets to one of us. This is to support and nurture one's own mindfulness.",
