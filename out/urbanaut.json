Assigned to a chaotic school once led by the mysteriously absent Salma Khatoon, Samiran's efforts to restore order only lead him deeper into unsettling events. From a water shortage to a snake in his room, his attempts to connect with the eccentric villagers only intensify his isolation. But behind it all, Samiran harbors a secret\u2014someone named Vrindaban. Why does he hide this figure? Is it the only refuge in a world that refuses to understand him? The play unravels questions about isolation, hidden truths, and the blurred lines between personal and professional life.About the artist:\u00a0 Somudranil Sarkar, a theatre maker from kolkata. He has over 25 years of experience in theatre and has had the privilege of training under some of the most respected names in the Bengali theatre circuit, including Rudraprasad Sengupta, Swatilekha Sengupta, Debshankar Halder, Sohini Sengupta, and Goutam Halder in Nandikar.

Loneliness is an intensely painful state which arises out of lack of intimacy and connectedness. People from every walk of life, even those with social contacts or pursuing successful careers can experience sadness from absence of belongingness. This painful experience is felt in a myriad of contexts such as breakups, disagreeing families, fear of rejection, unrelatability, shyness and so on.This support group has been constituted to bring people struggling with disconnectedness in various contexts together for a shared experience of comfort, belongingness, laughter, guidance and above all to break the cycle of sustained loneliness.The support is being organized and moderated by Nimesh George Mphil PhD who is a practicing psychologist based in Bangalore. This session will be co-moderated by Nimesh George & Gokul R, who are both practising psychologists in Bangalore.",

Ya Watchin? screening you shouldn\u2019t miss, it\u2019s a horror film.\u00a0After hosting several Halloween special screenings, including a special premiere of Longlegs with PVR in Bangalore last year, she\u2019s back with a cult classic this month, Rec (Spanish).\u00a0The special evening includes the screening of this 73-minute nail-biter (with an unpredictable ending \ud83d\udc40) and will be followed by a special performance by DJ Rishi Sippy, with the perfect tunes to boogie the scares away. Expect a custom cocktail menu, pass around snacks and more. So show up in your best Halloween costume, enjoy a movie & end your Sunday evening with a dance party! Note: Gates open at 7pm and the screening will begin at 7:30pm. We request all our guests to arrive on time for us to begin the screening as planned. The dance party will start at 9:45pm post the screening and mixer.Boo! Ya Watchin?, the brainchild of Mahima. V is a Bangalore-based film screening series that turns cult classics and hidden gems into shared, immersive experiences.\u00a0\u00a0REC (2007) is a Spanish found-footage horror film directed by Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Paco Plaza. The story follows TV reporter \u00c1ngela Vidal and her cameraman as they cover a routine night shift at a fire station\u2014until a call to an apartment building turns their night into a nightmare. Shot in real-time with a claustrophobic, handheld style, REC delivers relentless tension and scares across its tight 75-minute runtime. While its intensity may not resonate with everyone, it\u2019s widely regarded as one of the most terrifying found-footage horrors ever made.Rishi Sippy is a Bangalore-based DJ and is the brain behind beloved dance IPs in the city like Jackfruit Dance Party & Freak Opera. Rishi's performances are dynamic and immersive, fluid journeys that blend hypnotic minimalism with raw, driving energy.\u00a0At Urbanaut, we're building unique and niche experiences in collaboration with our ever-present partners. Invite yourself to one \u2014 or three \u2014 or hit us up with ideas and collaborations!Ladies Who Loiter is a celebration inspired by leisure, love and art.

    "description": "Slow down for a few mindful hours with us as we explore the meditative practice of mandala art. In this guided session, you\u2019ll learn to draw your own intricate, balanced patterns \u2014 one line at a time \u2014 and experience the quiet focus that comes with this beautiful, rhythmic process.Each participant will create a set of small mandalas that can be transformed into charming bookmarks, gift tags, or luggage ties \u2014 tiny tokens of calm you can carry with you.The session will be led by Usha Murthy, who has been practicing and teaching this art form for nearly a decade. Usha has conducted Dottin Mandala workshops in the U.S., and her work beautifully bridges the ancient roots of this practice \u2014 from Australian Aboriginal dot art to the Buddhist and Indian traditions of circular mandalas symbolizing life and harmony. To get a glimpse of her work, find her on Instagram @dottinmandalas.Her teaching style is gentle, step-by-step, and highly visual \u2014 a truly sensory experience. The workshop will be conducted in English, with Hindi support if needed.No prior art experience is required \u2014 just bring your curiosity and a willingness to slow down. All materials will be provided.Join us for a peaceful morning of art, conversation, and mindfulness \u2014 right in the cozy corners of our bookstore caf\u00e9.",

    "description": "India, circa 11th century. A shoemaker writes about the difficulty of changing society. A weaver ruminates on the value of work. A burglar rhymes about identifying the true jewels in life. A sex-worker writes searing lines about caste, as an offering to her 'shameless' deity... Kayaka ('work') is a musical ensemble that blends ancient progressive poems and writings with contemporary music. Led by renowned Bangalore musicians MD Pallavi and Bruce Lee Mani, the material for this acoustic concert is drawn mainly from the Vachanas. Winner of the prestigious 'Vachanasri Award', Pallavi has been working with this material for a long time. Adding Bruce's guitar, compositional skills and genre-fluid approach results in a stirring collaboration - where Western acoustic folk, blues, world music and jazz mingle freely with Indian folk and classical styles - all with hard-hitting,\u00a0lyrics that have lost none of their power, even after 800 years!",
