They are the tongue in cheek beacon of hope blending their hyper-caustic pogo punk with timeless pop bangers. \u2018Their guitars are crunchy, their drums are bullying and their basslines knit it all together like a middle child hatching a plan.\u2019 With their first EP Candyflip, the band explored different variants in style and challenged the genre locked norms of today's scene, breeding a caustic hyper-saturated concoction of Punk Pop and Indie. Hot Press Magazine cited them as \u201cPure off the bone punkadelic pleasure!\u201d In a review of their Single \u2018The Picky Eater\u2019. After gigging extensively around the country and beyond, the guys put their heads down again, worked on new songs, and headed back to the studio with the finished creation being their EP",
