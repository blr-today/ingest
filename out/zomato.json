And that’s precisely why we need an alternative to Goa, one which is away from the humdrum of life, one which brings peace and serenity for the weekend.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what Gokarna offers. If you are looking for a place for an escapade, to take a break after the week-long 9-5 office hours, and are tired of glancing at pictures of breath-taking beaches on your monitor, go ahead and pack your bags already.",

Once the capital city of the Vijayanagara Empire, it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site with over 500 ruins and monuments. Many consider Hampi to be the second largest city of its time, following only Beijing. Situated on the banks of the Tungabhadra River, Hampi boasts ancient India's grandeur with its intricate architecture, brilliant engineering, and breathtaking scenery. The most significant structure is the Virupaksha Temple, which is dedicated to the empire's patron deity. But don't be fooled into thinking that Hampi is only about history! The town blends history and modernity, with aesthetic cafes, cultural performances, and a variety of cuisines from around the world in the nearby Hippie Town.",
