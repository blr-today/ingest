    "description": "In this session of The Forum, we focus on the critical intersection of gender, urban spaces, and security. As cities expand and evolve, the safety and inclusivity of women within these spaces remain essential concerns. This discussion will center around the challenges women face in navigating urban environments, whether due to inadequate infrastructure, social norms, or policy shortcomings. \nPublic spaces\u2014whether transportation hubs, parks, or streets\u2014should be accessible to all, but many women experience these spaces as fraught with danger or restrictions. In this session, we aim to dissect these issues while also looking at how socio-economic backgrounds can further shape a woman\u2019s experience of urban life.\u00a0The role of law enforcement and public policy in addressing gender-based violence is another important focus.\u00a0Finally, this session will consider how the ability to move freely and confidently through the city is linked to broader issues of mobility and access. By engaging with these topics, we hope to generate ideas for creating cities that prioritise safety for all, especially women. \nThis is the second of our sessions titled,\u00a0The Forum,\u00a0a series of engaging discussions held at the BIC Library. Our goal is to bring together individuals from all walks of life,\u00a0ages 15 to 50, to discuss topics of importance in a setting that is both informed and informal. Whether you\u2019re passionate about current events, social issues, or cultural topics,\u00a0The Forum\u00a0provides a platform for open dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas.\u00a0Inspired by the ancient Roman forums, where citizens gathered to discuss and debate the issues of the day, these sessions aim to revive this tradition of community dialogue. \n",

As the film unfolds, a chorus of characters creates a tapestry of the Palestinian experience of this city and the trauma left by the massacre and expulsion, while vivid animations envision an alternate reality where the same characters live free from the trauma of the past and the violence of the present. Using never-before-seen archival footage of the Israeli soldiers who carried out the massacre and expulsion, the personified city explains that these events were so devastating that they fractured reality, and now there are two Lyds \u2013 one occupied and one free. As the film cuts between fantastical and documentary realities, it ultimately leaves the viewer questioning which future should prevail. Lyd dares to ask the question: what would the city be like had the Israeli occupation of Lyd never happened? \nLink to the trailer \nBye Bye Tiberias \nDocumentary Feature | French, Palestinian Arabic with English subtitles | France, Palestine, Belgium, Qatar | Lina Soualem | 2023 \nIn her early twenties, Hiam Abbass (Emmy-nominated for Succession) left her native Palestinian village to follow her dream of becoming an actress in Europe, leaving behind her mother, grandmother, and seven sisters. Thirty years later, her filmmaker daughter Lina returns with her to the village and questions for the first time her mother\u2019s bold choices, her chosen exile and the way the women in their family influenced both their lives. Set between past and present, BYE BYE TIBERIAS pieces together images of today, family footage from the nineties and historical archives to portray four generations of daring Palestinian women who keep their story and legacy alive through the strength of their bonds, despite exile, dispossession, and heartbreak. Palestine\u2019s entry for Best International Feature in the 2024 Academy Awards, this second feature from Lina Soualem premiered at Venice, won the Grierson Award at the BFI London Film Festival, had its North American Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, and won the shared jury prize at the Marrakech International Film Festival. An important film that beautifully portrays the complexity of Arab women\u2019s lives. \nLink to the trailer \nIn collaboration with \n \n",

    "description": "90 Minutes | Hindi (Tukaram abhangs will be sung in Marathi) | Ages 16 years + \nThis play is an adaptation of the seminal Marathi novel \u2018Anandowari\u2019 written by D.B. Mokashi in 1974. \nAnandowari (English translation: \u2018The Verandah of Bliss\u2019) looks at 17th-century saint poet Tukaram\u2019s story through his younger brother Kanha\u2019s perspective. Tukaram has gone missing again. This time, though, the hints seem ominous. We travel through those 3 days of Kanha\u2019s frantic search for Tuka and his many realisations about his brother. \nIn reminiscing about Tukaram, Kanha tries to grapple with Tuka\u2019s many identities: Tuka his brother, the son, the householder, the creative genius, a saint, a reformer, a rebel. \nThis act of reminiscence becomes an act of grappling with what and who he has lost, in the process giving us a great psychological insight into the events (personal, social and political) and impulses that shaped Tukaram\u2019s consciousness and made him who he was: one of the most beloved Bhakti saint poets of Maharashtra, as tender as he was fierce, as compassionate as he was unforgivingly harsh, as much a reformist as he was a transcendentalist. \nOur adaptation focuses on the search that lies at the heart of the text: a devotee in search of God, a man in search of his brother, a writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nCredits: \nOriginal Novel Anandowari by D.B Mokashi\nAdaptation and Direction: Gerish Khemani\nHindi Translation: Dr Jaya Dayal\nPerformed by: Varad Salvekar, Hrishabh Kanti\nBackground Score: Ruturaj Bhosle\nAbhang Composition: Keshav Kudale\nLight Design: Sachin Lele\nLights Operation: Prerana\nPoster and Creatives: Robin Patel \nDirector\u2019s Note: \nWhat interested me personally was the question of the creative consciousness of the saint poet Tukaram, the source of his poetry, his metaphysical preoccupations, his social rebellion, his love for his beloved God Vitthal. I was interested in finding a device through which I could approach this text. And then it struck me: what would happen if the writer stepped into his own story? His character has found salvation, what about the writer? How will he? It is an investigation into that search\u2026 A devotee in search of God. A man in search of his brother. A writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nThrough two texts \u2013 D. B Mokashi\u2019s original Anandowari and my text where Tuka meets Vithal and Mokashi enters his own story \u2013 multiple confrontations are imagined. Confrontation between Mokashi (writer) and Kanha (character), confrontation between Tuka (devotee) and Vitthal (God). Creator and creation? One writer (Mokashi) searching for another (Tuka)? And then the question prevails: Who gives meaning to the other? Both depend on each other for meaning. For identity. Can there be a God without a devotee? Can there be a writer without her creation? Each validates the other. And each has the power to cancel each other out. \nBut then what if they exchange roles? Or what if this duality itself is the biggest illusion? And so these two texts came to be juxtaposed, hoping to interpenetrate and illuminate each other. \nOur adaptation of Anandowari reeks of tremendous longing for the absolute and the madness, pain of creative consciousness and its concomitant search for meaning embodied in the existential desperation of the protagonists. \nWith Support From \n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "60 Minutes | Tamil | Suitable for all ages \nThe play \u201cNadapaavaadai\u201d centers on a woman who is forced to conduct burial rites for her entire village after the passing of her family member, who previously performed these duties.\u00a0 \nDue to social inequality and prevailing customs, women are rarely permitted to even enter the crematorium. The characters in the play question the lady\u2019s access to the crematorium and her role in carrying out those rituals that are traditionally associated with men. \n\u00a0The charismatic lady performs the rites by taking the center stage, with only men allowed to visit the crematorium. She leads the burial rites in full face of the public \u2013 which many would be reluctant to undertake or would not be allowed to do.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u201cNadapaavaadai\u201d attempts to initiate an engaging dialogue about her role in diverse social and cultural contexts and its implications.

    "description": "Darya Mosenzon\u00a0is a pianist and composer specializing in North African music. She began playing the piano and composing at a young age and studied classical music throughout her childhood, but was drawn since adolescence to other genres of music as well, culminating in her choice to pursue\u00a0Moroccan and Algerian music. \nDarya will present a solo piano recital featuring original and traditional North African music, infused with a classical-Jazzy twist. This intimate acoustic experience will blend the evocative rhythms of the Maghreb with soulful melodies, culminating in a vibrant instrumental dance party. As Haaretz aptly described, her performance is \u201ca blend of meticulous restraint and exhilarating passion.\u201d \nIn collaboration with: \n \nPhoto credit:\u00a0Ronen Goldman \n",

    "description": "Every day we hear something unusual. A fire here, a flood there, a storm surge, a cloudburst. These events affect all of us, our well-being, our health, our family, our work. Their frequency and intensity are increasing. Fortunately, however, we no longer lack explanations for these events. We know fossil fuels and the destruction of Nature by us humans are the primary reasons for the alarming acceleration in global warming. \nAwareness is the first step towards change, and Rajan Mehta\u2019s\u00a0Backstage Climate\u00a0is an attempt to make you aware of global warming and climate change in a simple and interesting manner. It demystifies this grim reality\u2014the science, the politics and the economics behind climate change. It also gives you a glimpse of the policies, technology and solutions that can help save the planet and ensure our survival. \nGoing slightly beyond mere awareness, the attempt is to help the reader connect the dots and develop a perspective on the reasons, impact and solutions that can help us avoid a climate crisis. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Rajan Mehta is in conversation with Prem Panicker. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in September 2024. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!

The politics of the time, the many characters who strode the stage of History. They speak to us through their original letters which will take the reader to the very core of the story and give a ring side view of the events over a nearly three year period\u2026 \nA talk by Uday S Kulkarni will be followed by a conversation with\u00a0Amit Paranjape and a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

Our primary goal is to curate sessions that cater to the diverse interests and ages within our library community. Through this programming we wish for the library to become a dynamic space that goes beyond traditional book-related activities. \nWe also aim to provide a platform for members of the community to sometimes host these events we curate. If you have event ideas that align with our vision, please reach out to us at collab@bangaloreinternationalcentre.org \n",
