    "description": "Ever wondered what it feels like to step into a 500-year-old theatrical tradition? Immerse yourself in the vibrant world of Yakshagana, the ancient theatrical art form from coastal Karnataka. This programme combines live performance, interactive demonstrations, and cultural education to bring you closer to one of India\u2019s most dynamic traditional art forms. \nBegin your journey in our foyer (6pm), where master artists demonstrate the intricate makeup techniques that transform performers into mythological characters. You can also get a close look at the authentic costumes and ornate headgear used in the performances. \nThe main program (6:30pm) takes you through the complete journey of a Yakshagana performance, from the sacred Chowki Pooje ritual to a captivating final act. Watch as artists demonstrate the art of transformation through costume and makeup, learn about the powerful musical traditions with live demonstrations of the Chende and Maddale, and even try your hand at basic Abhinaya (expressions) alongside seasoned performers. \nThe evening culminates in a spellbinding 30-minute Yakshagana performance, the perfect blend of music, dance, dialogue, and costume in this centuries-old storytelling tradition. Throughout the event, the\u00a0Sutradar (narrator) guides you through each element (in English and Kannada), offering insights into the cultural significance and artistic nuances of this magnificent art form. \nWhether you\u2019re a cultural enthusiast, performing arts lover, or simply curious about Indian traditional theater, this immersive experience offers a rare glimpse into the heart of Yakshagana, where tradition meets interaction, and ancient stories come alive through spectacular performance. \nThis is the first performance of our new series\u00a0BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka\u2019s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression.\u00a0Through demonstrations, performances, and academic discussions, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

It\u2019s been two years since his father Ambuli had been gored to death by this same beast.

    "description": "Maag reimagines Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth as a dystopian tale set in the ancient settlement of Burzohm, deeply embedded within the rich cultural tapestry of Kashmir. This opera unfolds in lyrical Kashmiri verse, seamlessly blending the traditional folk theatre of Bhaand Pather with avant-garde, post-postmodern performance art. Conceived by the Theatre for Kashmir team, Maag pushes the boundaries of theatrical expression through daring performance design and innovative storytelling techniques that challenge conventional norms. \nThe opera\u2019s minimalist cast underscores its experimental ethos, with each performer inhabiting multiple roles, shifting identities with effortless precision. This approach not only highlights the versatility of the actors but also reflects the opera\u2019s exploration of fractured identities and the fluidity of power. Central to the narrative are three enigmatic shamans\u2014personified as a Cat, Hyena, and Raven\u2014whose striking physicality and symbolic costumes evoke ancient archetypes, each embodying a distinct facet of influence, manipulation, and fate. Their presence weaves an otherworldly thread through the story, amplifying the opera\u2019s dark, atmospheric undertones while anchoring it in the mythic and the timeless. \nComplementing Maag is a special musical performance, Dastaan-e-Sama, presented by the ensemble\u2019s Sufiyana musicians. Dastaan-e-Sama is a captivating journey through the mystical traditions of Kashmir, blending rich storytelling, soul-stirring music, and evocative raqs (sacred dance). Together, Maag and Dastaan-e-Sama offer a profound exploration of Kashmir\u2019s cultural and spiritual heritage, inviting audiences into a space where ancient traditions meet contemporary artistic innovation. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

A good meal can collapse the distance between my past and my present, ferry me to faraway family, or bring me closer to my inner child. For writers, food is an especially potent means to delve into memory, notions of home, heritage, and relationships. \nIn this workshop, open to writers in all genres, we will consider the plate as a portal, reaching through sensorium and memory to explore what food can offer to our practice. We will read prose and poetry about food together and discuss the role that food plays as a cultural signifier, as a love language in the domestic space, as a carrier for history, and more. \nThrough guided generative work, participants will be invited to consider the food that has nourished them in its fullness \u2013 where it comes from, what historical and personal narratives it holds, what language it allows them to access, how it might have changed over time. We\u2019ll read, write, and share, working together to discover the ways in which the theme of food can nourish our writing. \nWhile the workshop will be conducted in English, and we\u2019ll be reading primarily English-language texts, writers are welcome to make use of any language(s) they wish to. \n",

A celebrated passenger Indian, Mohandas Gandhi, went to Natal in 1893. A decade later, an undistinguished passenger Indian, Mohanlal, the great-grandfather of author Amrita Shah, arrived in Natal. As a child growing up in India, she was fascinated by the mystery surrounding her ancestor\u2019s journey. Why had he gone there? What was the name of the woman he met along the way, who gave birth to her grandmother? And did he know Gandhi? \nThere were no clues at home\u2014no reminiscences, letters, documents, memorabilia, not even a photograph. She embarked on a search for her wandering forefather with limited expectations, but doors opened serendipitously, and a paper trail emerged, strewn across archives in South Africa, Mauritius, the UK, and India. This search provided answers but also revealed the immense value in researching a seemingly ordinary man\u2019s history. \nAmrita Shah, author of The Other Mohan: In Britain\u2019s Indian Ocean Empire, will be in conversation with Ramjee Chandran to discuss the book\u2019s findings, including new revelations about Gandhi\u2019s Satyagraha campaign.

    "description": "60 mins | English \nSpiralling into Desire\u00a0traces a woman\u2019s descent into her deep body to access and retrieve her true autonomy. \nThe sharing draws parallels from the first epic poem The Descent of Innana\u00a0and is set at the intersection of the arts, psychology and spirituality. \nInspired by artist\u2019s practice of authentic movement and natural dreamwork, the performance builds on both \u2013 the creative process and the witnessing process, as it explores the question, \u2018How do we hold desire in our bodies?\u2019 \nCredits:\nConcept, Research & Performance: Brinda Jacob-Janvrin\nDramaturgy: Diya Naidu\nSound: Deepthi Bhaskar\nVideo Art: Zero Rules\nDirection: Roohi Dixit\nCinematography: Preetha Jayaraman\nEditor & Music Supervisor: Ziba Bhagwagar\nOutside Eye & Ear: Vinod Susheela\nDesign (Costume & Set): Swathi Shetty\nDesign (Video Art & Projection): Sourav Bhahmachari\nPublicity Design & Execution: Monica Gangoly\nProduction: Tia Ann \nPhase 1 of this project was supported by:\nVinod Ravindran (Voice Coach)\nPriyabrat Panigrahi (Movement Coach) \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "This is not a solo |\u00a023 min |\u00a0Vanessa Vieira da Cunha\n(De)construction. The hidden. The exposed. What is. What was. What it no longer is but could be again. Antagonistic relationships create space for a gray place, the place that inhabits what is not yet one thing or the other. This is not a solo aims to research and deepen issues related to identity, the exposure of the self, the importance we attribute to the set of qualities and particularities that we think define us, the place of confrontation with the vision of the another, the dizzying sensation of detaching ourselves from what is known and comfortable to reveal inner layers that remain inaccessible to others.\n \nEgo | Echo |\u00a015 min |\u00a0Indrek Kornel\nA dialogue between self and surroundings, Ego | Echo explores the interplay of reflection an resonance. Hyper-aware of the textures, sounds, tastes, and rhythms of the here and now, the performer navigates the constant feedback loop between their body and the world around them. How does the echo of their presence alter the ego of their being? In this improvised journey, they let each moment reshape them\u2014a push and pull between intention and instinct, order and chaos, heaven and hell. It is a movement through the shifting landscapes of self and space, where the only constant is the present. \nFloating Clouds |\u00a015 min |\u00a0Abhilash Ningappa\nFloating Clouds is a contemplative performance that examines the complexities of life through the lens of artistic expression. It reflects on the universal challenges, aspirations, and fleeting triumphs that shape the human experience The piece combines expressive dance, spoken word, and symbolic gestures to create a rich tapestry of movement and meaning. The choreography, marked by fluidity and grace, evokes the transient beauty of clouds, offering a metaphor for the impermanence of life. Spoken text serves as a bridge, drawing the audience into the narrative and fostering a shared space of reflection. Through its interplay of movement and language. Floating Clouds invites audiences to engage with themes of transformation, resilience, and the ephemeral nature of existence.\n \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "\u2018There may be a time, Guardian, when it doesn\u2019t matter whether our peace is founded on the truth or a lie. All that matters is that there be peace. Would you consider the possibility that that time is now?\u2019 \nAn impoverished young man, Jagat, is found guilty of murder. For his crime, he is sentenced to the highest form of punishment\u2014the sleep of death for a century, with the promise of revival should his innocence ever be proven. \nBut his act sparks violence in the great city of Peruma, with the Commune, an anarchist collective of workers, revolting against the Council, which has ruled Peruma for four hundred years. Drained by endless conflict, Council and Commune negotiate a hundred-year treaty that is to be enforced by an impartial body: the guardians of the Confederation. \nAnd now, a century later, the Charter is a week away from lapsing. Tensions run high in Peruma. As an uncertain future looms, Nila, a young guardian, is approached by a mysterious woman who insists that Jagat\u2019s case be reopened before it\u2019s too late. Drawn by the prospect of undoing a possible historical injustice, Nila agrees. But as she begins to unearth the past, forces, known and unknown, thwart her at every turn. \nWhat secrets does the city hold? Who is working in the shadows against her\u2014and why? What is the price of resurrecting a martyr? Gautam Bhatia\u2019s\u00a0The Sentence\u00a0raises questions about justice, rights and ethics that will echo in your mind long after you\u2019ve turned the last page.\u00a0It is about how the fate of many rests on the decision of one person\u2014a decision that might tear a city into two. \nGautam Bhatia will be in conversation with Shrabonti Bagchi.\u00a0An audience Q&A session will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Of all regions of India, the Deccan has the most diverse architectural traditions, nowhere better shown than in the variety of stone temples sponsored under a succession of dynasties which ruled peninsular India over some 700 years. To illustrate this unique diversity, Michell explores religious monuments at lesser-known sites. He begins with Early Chalukya temples overlooking the Tungabhadra river at Alampur, and ends with the imposing Kakatiya monument at the out of the way village of Palampet, both in Telangana. In between, he discusses the Nolamaba period shrines at Nandi and Shravana Belgola, and those of the Later Chalukyas at Sudi, Kuruvatti and Lakkundi, all in Karnataka. He concludes with the little visited Hoysala period shrines at Belavadi, Mosale and Agraha Bachhahalli. \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A Session with the audience. \nImage credit \u2013 Surendra Kumar \nIn collaboration with:\n\u00a0 \n",
