It vividly illustrates the rich cultural diversity, economic prosperity, spiritual and religious intensity of the region. \nIn the late thirteenth century, Marco Polo, along with his father and uncle, travelled from Venice to the court of Kublai Khan before heading south to India. There, he documented the thriving Pandya Kingdom in Thanjavur, known for its pearl trade, well-structured society, and beautiful temples, as well as the spice-laden markets of Kerala and the bustling port of Cambay in Gujarat, Western India. \nFast-forward over a century, and we have Niccol\u00f2 de\u2019 Conti, who provided a detailed account of India\u2019s Deccan region. He admired the fortified beauty of Vijayanagara, celebrated the vibrant festivals like Deepavali and Maha Navami, and acknowledged the cultural richness of Cambay in Gujarat, Western India and Mylapore in Tamil Nadu, an early centre of Christianity. \nThrough their first-hand observations, this documentary highlights a medieval India characterised by thriving trade, religious tolerance, and architectural beauty, showcasing the lasting impact of these travellers\u2019 encounters with a vibrant and complex civilisation. \nThe documentary, realised by MINDIA films, was entirely conceived and produced by the Consulate General of Italy in Bengaluru, under the aegis of the Karnataka Department of Tourism and the Archaeological Survey of India, and with the support of Baldota Group. \nPresented by: \n \nCreated by: \n \nIn Association with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "This session offers a deep and reflective exploration of India\u2019s journey toward self-reliance in defence research and development, inspired by the DRDO publication \u201cEndeavours in Self-Reliance: Defence Research 1983\u20132018\u201d, by KG Narayanan. The book captures a critical period of transformation in India\u2019s defence landscape, chronicling key achievements, institutional efforts, and the steady march toward technological autonomy over three and a half decades. \nThe session will open with a keynote presentation by Mr. Narayanan, who will outline the central themes and insights drawn from the book. This includes the evolution of DRDO\u2019s role, the emergence of indigenous capabilities, and the broader strategic imperative of self-reliance in defence. The presentation will set the stage for a nuanced conversation about the motivations, challenges, and breakthroughs that have defined India\u2019s R&D efforts in the defence sector. \nFollowing the keynote, a high-level panel discussion will bring together eminent voices who have been closely involved in shaping this journey. Dr Samir V. Kamat, Chairman DRDO and Secretary, Department of Defence R&D; Dr S. Christopher, former Chairman DRDO; and Dr Anantha Krishnan M, senior defence journalist and author, will engage in a dynamic exchange of perspectives. The discussion will be moderated by Air Marshal (Retd.) P. Rajkumar, providing context and continuity across decades of institutional memory and technological evolution. \nTogether, the panel will reflect not only on past achievements but also on the pressing needs and strategic directions for the future, offering valuable insights into what it will take to secure and sustain a truly self-reliant defence ecosystem in India. \n",

Indira and A. V. Arunkumar). \nThe book addresses one of the most urgent challenges of our time \u2013 sustainable development. Across the globe economies are grappling with the combined pressures of climate change, inequality, and unsustainable growth. Basic needs remain unmet for large sections of the population, prompting a growing recognition that we must rethink how we define and pursue development. Sustainability is no longer a peripheral concern\u2014it is central, complex, and evolving, requiring new approaches and frameworks. \nThe book brings together diverse perspectives on the critical drivers of sustainable development, namely, governance through institutions, readiness through technology and accessibility to finance. While technology is often seen as a key enabler, its transformative potential depends deeply on the institutional and policy environment in which it is embedded. Institutions\u2014formal and informal\u2014shape development outcomes, and public policy plays a crucial role in aligning these efforts with sustainability goals. \nFocusing on the Indian context, the book event will have eminent panel members exploring the three interconnected themes of (1) Institutions and Development; (2) Technology and Innovation; and (3) Policy and Governance. \nWe look forward to an engaging conversation as we reflect on the ideas in the volume and their relevance for policy, research, and practice. \n",

    "description": "How do we each feel a Raga? While Western classical music often associates major scales with happiness and minor scales with sadness, Indian Ragas evoke a wide spectrum of emotions\u2014unique to each listener. Could a Raga that brings joy to one person stir a different emotion in another? \nIs there hidden information in the space between two notes? While the twelve notes of the well-tempered scale were standardized only in the 18th century, Indian classical music has long embraced microtones\u2014subtle pitches between the familiar notes. Can the human mind truly perceive these shades of sound? \nAnd must we always stay within the bounds of musical grammar? What happens when we take a set of notes and let them breathe, transform, and find their own flow? \nThis World Music Day, join us for Insta-Ragam\u2014an immersive exploration of Raga structures, followed by a live session where you get to make music with the artists. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "In the 1940s, a rebellious teenager tore through the bustling lanes of Surat\u2019s Dawoodi Bohra mohalla on his rickety bicycle, noisily jangling his rusty bell. Obsessed with cricket, mischief and pranks, nobody could have predicted then that young Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi would one day stride across the glittering halls of the Rashtrapati Bhavan to swear in as the third Muslim Chief Justice of India. \nThis is the story of Justice A.M. Ahmadi \u201426th Chief Justice of India \u2014 who served during some of India\u2019s most turbulent political and legal moments. From his powerful dissent in the Babri Masjid case as he withstood immense political pressures, the fight for federalism in S R Bommai to his extraordinary courage in the unforgettable General Vaidya assassination case, his legacy is remembered for safeguarding democracy and the social fabric of our nation.\u00a0 \nBut beyond the courtroom, his story is also one of personal struggles and conviction\u2014navigating a world often hostile to religious minorities, protecting others from the same, or confronting difficult questions of identity and dissent within his own community. For Justice Ahmadi, secularism wasn\u2019t just a legal principle\u2014it was a way of life. \nPart biography, part legal history, and part family memoir\u2014 this book, written by Justice Ahmadi\u2019s granddaughter, is a journey through the corridors of power and an unflinching portrait of a man who dared to speak truth to power no matter the consequences.\u00a0 \nIn this session, author and journalist Insiyah Vahanvaty speaks with senior advocate and legal scholar Aditya Sondhi about her deeply personal and powerfully political biography,\u00a0The Fearless Judge:The Life and Times of Justice A M Ahmadi. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India\u2019s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of \u2018direct benefits\u2019 which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session, Louise Tillin, the author of the book, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "45 minutes |\u00a0English, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi with English subtitles | 2004 \nAs part of BIC\u2019s Pride Programs, this session will include a screening of T Jayashree\u2019s Many People, Many Desires, followed by a panel discussion with T Jayashree, Mira Brunner and Siddharth Narrain. \nMany People, Many Desires is centered around the interviews of many members of the LGBTQ community in Bangalore at the time. The film was shot entirely in a MiniDV tape format. Starting from an exploration of sexuality and human rights, it allows the viewer to hear the first-person narratives of some of those who were engaged with the sexuality movement of the time \u2013 whose work is instrumental for the fight for legal rights for queer people in India. \nUsing legal discrimination against sexual minorities as its starting point, the film explores the relationship between class, sexuality, and gender. The film captures early years in the movement against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial law which criminalized homosexual behavior and has now, through efforts which included some of those interviewed in the film, been read down. \nThe panel will talk about what has changed, what has remained the same, and QAMRA\u2019s (the Queer Archive of Memory, Reflection, and Activism) attempts to preserve this history. They will discuss their perspectives on archiving queer material and the responsibilities of preserving what is still in living memory. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis year, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is \u2014 unconforming, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression.

It is not just a set of swaras/notes but a flow of melodic content, defined by certain contours which gives each ragas unique flavor. \nUnique relationships exist between the notes. While individual notes define a swara position, the reflection of the swara relationship expounds the melodic variations. \nHence it is essential to understand these relationships and how they flower into a raaga. While manodharma (creativity) has a big part in it, our huge repository of compositions plays an important role in providing a framework for this exploration. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "The evening will see two Contemporary dance performances. \nMetamorphosis \nThe dancers explore the reactions of what happens when one goes through the process of transformation. How does one\u2019s body\u2019s senses and feelings react through this unending loop between creation of new patterns, destruction, and recreation of one another. Metamorphosis dives deep into the question of how a pattern impacts the body? And during the period of transition when old patterns are fading away and the new self is finding its expression in the world, what is then your relationship to the changed self, and how does your body respond to this change? In this duet movement piece, the\u00a0choreographer emphasizes the transformation of a personality from one to another. What is this new self? Is it an add-on to the old pattern or a breakaway into something new? \nLost in Oscillation \nThis piece dives deep into the strange and shifting world of self-doubt.\u00a0The dancer embodies ethereal beings caught in a surreal dreamscape, where self-doubt manifests as a physical entity. This intangible force envelops the dancer, distorting their movements and warping their perception of self. The stage transforms into a shifting labyrinth of reflective surfaces, reflecting fragmented images that mirror the dancers\u2019 internal struggle.\u00a0Expect sharp angles, sudden gestures, and moments that swing between chaos and calm. With abstract visuals and a haunting soundscape, this piece pulls you into a surreal inner world where nothing feels certain, not even your own reflection. \nSupported by: \n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Around 15 years ago, the then UPA government had launched an all-out offensive (commonly known as \u2018Operation Greenhunt\u2019) targeting the armed cadres of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (also known as Naxalites) across the \u2018Red Corridor\u2019 which consisted of Naxal-affected districts spanning Central and Eastern India and spilling into Southern India as well. According to reports at the time, Naxal cadres were active (to varying degrees) in at least 165 districts across this corridor which was also coterminous with the most backward, primarily tribal and the most resource rich parts of the country. The BJP government, which came to power in 2014, continued this policy of an all-out offensive against the Naxalites extending this to target the urban activists/ sympathisers of the CPI (Maoist) as well.\u00a0 \nThere has been a marked decline in Naxalite activity since then with the number of affected districts falling to 70 in 2021 and newer reports suggesting that the Naxalite presence is restricted to fewer than 50 districts now. In a strong policy statement, Home Minister Amit stated that \u201cNaxalism will be completely eliminated by 2026.\u201d Human rights activists have questioned the state\u2019s all-out approach of using overwhelming force to quash Naxalism as this method is not addressing the fundamental grievances of the residents of these tribal parts which is of their displacement and exploitation of the rich natural resources by large corporations. Several Naxalites have surrendered over the past two decades but questions have also been raised on the efficacy and sincerity of the surrender policy.\u00a0 \nKarnataka was also impacted by the wave of Naxalism and, commencing in the 1980s, cadres were recruited for this cause in the State as well. In the 1990s, it seemed like the movement was spreading its base in Karnataka aggressively but a series of encounters including that of Saketh Rajan, the charismatic Naxal leader, in 2005, ensured that the movement did not become widespread in Karnataka. There was also intense churn among a section of the cadres of the CPI (Maoist) in Karnataka after this as well with one group exiting the party as it had ideological differences with the central leadership of the party. Over the two decades since that time, the Naxalite movement has ebbed in Karnataka with several Naxalites also surrendering. Early in 2025, with the \u201csurrender\u201d of the last group of Naxalites in Karnataka, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah declared the state to be Naxal-free. The Karnataka model presents a template of how Naxalism, in its violent form, can be ended. By all accounts, the Karnataka model is unique for the manner in which former Naxalites joined the mainstream of activism. The role of the mature civil society in Karnataka that played a crucial role in facilitating this process is also important. \nThe discussion proposes to dwell on the trajectory of Naxalism in Karnataka from its inception in the 1980s till early 2025, and whether the state is willing to seriously engage with the grievances of marginalised people who became Naxals. Is the state empathetic to the concerns of the Naxalites who came overground? The discussion proposes to dwell on all these aspects while broadly focussing on the success of the Karnataka model of mainstreaming Left-Wing Extremists.  \n",

    "description": "Tarana and Thillana\u2014two strikingly vibrant forms in Hindustani and Carnatic classical traditions\u2014share more than just syllabic play and rhythmic flair. Yet, they are often misunderstood, conflated, or heard in isolation. \nThis workshop invites participants to explore the shared pulse and divergent expressions of these two forms. Through live demonstrations, guided listening, and cross-cultural comparison, we will experience the same raga unfold as a Tarana and a Thillana, tracing how it transforms in structure, tempo, and mood across styles. \nThe session will introduce key rhythmic devices like layakari, jatis, and tihais, explore improvisation techniques in each tradition, and unpack the role of these forms in both concert and dance settings. Alongside a deep listening experience, participants will also gain a historical understanding of how Tarana and Thillana evolved and how they continue to be shaped by performance and pedagogy today. \nLed by expert practitioners from both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions, this workshop is designed for listeners, learners, dancers, and musicians alike\u2014anyone curious to hear, feel, and understand rhythm as language and lineage. \n",
