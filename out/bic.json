Indira and A. V. Arunkumar). \nThe book addresses one of the most urgent challenges of our time \u2013 sustainable development. Across the globe economies are grappling with the combined pressures of climate change, inequality, and unsustainable growth. Basic needs remain unmet for large sections of the population, prompting a growing recognition that we must rethink how we define and pursue development. Sustainability is no longer a peripheral concern\u2014it is central, complex, and evolving, requiring new approaches and frameworks. \nThe book brings together diverse perspectives on the critical drivers of sustainable development, namely, governance through institutions, readiness through technology and accessibility to finance. While technology is often seen as a key enabler, its transformative potential depends deeply on the institutional and policy environment in which it is embedded. Institutions\u2014formal and informal\u2014shape development outcomes, and public policy plays a crucial role in aligning these efforts with sustainability goals. \nFocusing on the Indian context, the book event will have eminent panel members exploring the three interconnected themes of (1) Institutions and Development; (2) Technology and Innovation; and (3) Policy and Governance. \nWe look forward to an engaging conversation as we reflect on the ideas in the volume and their relevance for policy, research, and practice. \n",

    "description": "The years between ages 10 and 19 are marked by intense physiological, psychological, and social change. Adding to the challenges of this already turbulent phase are mobile devices and social media. These platforms often exploit insecurities, creating echo chambers and negative feedback loops. While digital life can connect us, it also has the power to isolate. The TV series Adolescence highlights the potentially dangerous consequences of these overlapping forces. \nIn this conversation, a panel of experts, drawing from both professional knowledge and lived experience, explores what adolescence looks like in the age of social media, particularly in urban India. Taking the TV show as a starting point, the discussion will look at the realities young people face today and consider how parents, schools, and other adults can help support individual and collective well-being. \n",

    "description": "Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India\u2019s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of \u2018direct benefits\u2019 which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session, Louise Tillin, the author of the book, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Abhang is a genre of\u00a0classical\u00a0music from Maharashtra, primarily sung in praise of\u00a0Sri\u00a0Vitthala of Pandharpur. The term Abhang means no ending or no interruption. Over 10,000 Abhangs were composed by various Sants of Maharashtra, including Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Eknath, Sant Tukaram, Sant Namdev, and Sant Janabhai. Emerging from the Bhakti Sampradaya in the 12th century, Abhangs have become integral to Concerts and Bhajans. Varkaris (devotees of Sri Vitthala) sing Abhangs while walking towards Pandharpur. Sri.\u00a0Purandaradasa adopted the name \u2018Purandara Vitthala\u2019 as his ankitanama, as \u2018Vitthala\u2019 was his Ishta Murti, while the name \u2018Purandara\u2019 was bestowed upon him by his guru, Sri Vyasa Raya. \nUma Kumar, Carnatic Singer from Switzerland, and\u00a0the ensemble\u00a0will perform 12 Abhangs composed by 10 composers, set in 12 different Hindustani ragas and presented in both on-beat and off-beat rhythms.\u00a0She\u00a0will render these Abhangs in the Carnatic style, accompanied by Violin and Mridangam,\u00a0while complementing the sound with\u00a0Tabla and\u00a0Manjira to fully express these divine compositions\u2019 deep emotions. \nAbhang Mela aims to create a musical symphony, blending the bhava from singing, the nada from the Violin, the laya from the Tabla and Mridangam, and the high-pitched rhythms from the Manjira, alongside the melodious sound of the Tanpura. Music lovers are invited to enjoy this unique musical experience. \nPresented by: \nUma Kumar \n",

    "description": "How do we each feel a Raga? While Western classical music often associates major scales with happiness and minor scales with sadness, Indian Ragas evoke a wide spectrum of emotions\u2014unique to each listener. Could a Raga that brings joy to one person stir a different emotion in another? \nIs there hidden information in the space between two notes? While the twelve notes of the well-tempered scale were standardized only in the 18th century, Indian classical music has long embraced microtones\u2014subtle pitches between the familiar notes. Can the human mind truly perceive these shades of sound? \nAnd must we always stay within the bounds of musical grammar? What happens when we take a set of notes and let them breathe, transform, and find their own flow? \nThis World Music Day, join us for Insta-Ragam\u2014an immersive exploration of Raga structures, followed by a live session where you get to make music with the artists. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Raaga music is the core essence of Indian classical music. It is not just a set of swaras/notes but a flow of melodic content, defined by certain contours which gives each raga s unique flavor. \nUnique relationships exist between the notes. While individual notes define a swara position, the reflection of the swara relationship expounds the melodic variations. \nHence it is essential to understand these relationships and how they flower into a raaga. While manodharma (creativity) has a big part in it, our huge repository of compositions plays an important role in providing a framework for this exploration. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "What would justice look like if it spoke in a queer voice? How might legal judgments shift if they were written through the lived experiences and realities of LGBTQIA+ individuals? \nIn this session, we explore the bold and imaginative work of The Queer Judgments Project,\u00a0an initiative that seeks to re-think, re-write, and re-invent legal judgments through queer and complementary perspectives. Emerging from a series of conversations among scholars, activists, and legal thinkers, the project asks a vital question: how could legal decisions involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics be expressed differently, more inclusively, more justly? \nAt the heart of the discussion is the project\u2019s first major output: an edited collection that offers 26 re-imagined judgments and commentaries from across the globe. Through this collection, contributors bring their diverse disciplinary backgrounds and personal insights to bear on the law, queering traditional frameworks and imagining alternative approaches to legal reasoning. \nThis session will engage with the creative, critical, and deeply personal work that underpins these re-written judgments. It will reflect on how the project aims not just to critique existing legal structures but to open up new possibilities for justice that better reflect the experiences of LGBTQIA+ and other minoritized communities. \nThis year, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is \u2014 unconforming, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression.
