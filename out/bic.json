Weaver, mystic, poet, Shah Hussain kept away from \u2018peeri\u2019, \u2018meeri\u2019, all kinds of high sounding titles, he lives in our hearts as \u2018faqeer nimaana\u2019 (the lowly faqeer). \nMela Chiraaga\u2019an Urs is celebrated every year in remembrance of this poet faqeer Shah Hussain and his beloved disciple, a Hindu Brahmin boy Madho Lal, as they lie buried in their twin graves near Lahore. So inextricably connected, Shah Husain is also remembered as Madho Lal Hussain. 2024 marks Madho lal Hussain\u2019s 436th Urs, his death anniversary, a celebration of the final union with the beloved divine ( \u2018Urus\u2019 in Arabic is a wedding) \nThis Mela, a confluence of his poetry, woven with music and narrative, is his journey as a Julaaha (weaver), a \u2018malaamati\u2019, as Faqeer Nimaana, the lowly faqeer. It celebrates Punjab\u2019s common cultural landscape, the common poetry, the language, the voice, which remains one despite the border that separates us. \nSupported by:\n \n",

How does one unlearn societal norms and expectations to build relationships that are authentic, nurturing, and filled with love still? \nWe meet these 3 couples near what they think is the end of their (love) stories. \nBut is it, really, The End? \nCredits: \nDesign & Direction: Nikhita Singh \nWriters: Nikhita Singh, Mitali Kalagi, Sambita De \nCast: Mitali Kalagi, Rituparna Sanyal, Kaustav Sinha, Aditya Kashyap \nMovement Director: Babusha Jain \nMusic: Hashparker (Harsh Choudhary) \nLyrics & Poetry: Madhumoy Satpathy \nAssistant Director: Rituparna Sanyal \nProduction Manager & Photographer: Divyansh Thada \nProduction Assistant: Sambita De \nCostume Design: Simran Jagdale \nSet Design: Nikhita Singh, Rituparna Sanyal, Vivek Jadhav \nLight Design: Nikhita Singh, Rahul Kumar \nPoster Design: Vighnesh Kharadkar, Debosmita Mazumdar \nSocial Media Design: Tanya Vaghela \nSocial Media Planning & Strategy: Divya Sundrani \nMarketing & Publicity: Dheeraj Dubey \nCreative Director for Visual Promos: Omkar Phatak \nOutreach & Brand Advocacy Partner: Centre for Contemporary Folklore \nSupported by Tamaasha Studio Foundation\u2019s UsPaar Residency. \n\u00a0 \nThis is a BIC Elsewhere Event. \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences.
