    "description": "As the Supreme Court of India completes seventy-five years, how do we understand its role in shaping the country\u2019s institutions and democratic ideals?

The discussion features Justice S. Muralidhar, Justice N.

    "description": "Tat-Tvam Asi is a meditative dance production that explores the essence of surrender as a path to self-realisation, through the lives of Andal, Radha, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu\u2014each a yogi in their own right. Drawing from the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna says, \u201cAs all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly, \u201d this work reflects the multiple ways one can find the divine: through devotion, knowledge, or selfless action. The production unfolds as a series of \u00a0vignettes\u2014Andal\u2019s karmic service, Radha\u2019s longing rooted in bhakti, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu\u2019s ecstatic sankeertana\u2014interwoven with Krishna \u2019s own voice as the sutradhar (narrator). From the chariot of Jagannatha in Puri to the quiet sanctum of a temple, the narrative reveals the beauty of total surrender, dissolving the ego in divine love. Blending classical dance traditions such as Bharatnatyam and Gaudiya Nritya with original music and poetic texts, Tat-Tvam Asi is a journey into Krishna Tattvam\u2014the omnipresence of the divine within and around us. \nThe depth of this timeless message and wisdom (familiar to many Vedantic scholars and Indians) was explored by Neha through the many coloured hues of devotion (bhakti) found in ancient lores and cultures. Neha chose the beloved pastoral God Krishna as the focus of bhakti of the devotee. Neha\u2019s approach to Tat Tvam Asi is episodic. Fragments from Andal, Radha and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were revisited and evoked with compelling conviction through her intense abhinaya. Neha Mondal has conceptualized Tat-Tvam Asi after years of deep reflection on the nature of devotion and surrender. Her creative process involved studying scriptures, poetry, and the lives of Andal, Radha, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to understand their spiritual journeys. She collaborated closely with scholars, musicians, and writers to shape a narrative that is both intimate and universal. As a dancer rooted in tradition yet open to exploration, Neha wove together movement, music, and storytelling to evoke the transformative power of bhakti. This production is a culmination of her artistic introspection and spiritual inquiry, brought to life through dance. \nCredits \nConcept & Choreography: Neha Mondal \nScript: Smt.

    "description": "Insider accounts from political aides, bureaucrats, and diplomats have long illuminated the workings of power\u2014but even more enigmatic were the lobbyists. Operating in the shadows, often invisible to public scrutiny, they were intimately privy to clandestine negotiations, back-channel discussions, and subtle bureaucratic skirmishes. In his new roman-\u00e0-clef\u00a0For No Reason At All, Ramjee Chandran shines a light on this hidden world. \nChandran\u2014well\u2011known in Bangalore as a journalist, publisher, and podcaster\u2014has, until now, remained silent about his time as a lobbyist in 1980s New Delhi, a pivotal era just before major economic reforms took hold. \nDrawing from real events, the novel charts the journey of a young lobbyist caught in a high-stakes conflict over silicon metal\u2014a material deemed strategically vital. Central to the drama is Metkem Silicon, which, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, devoted 17 years to developing indigenous silicon metal technology. Yet their efforts collided with a rival scheme spearheaded by the Department of Electronics, which wanted to bypass local innovation and import U.S. technology. \nWhat ensued was a four\u2011year bureaucratic war: media leaks, secret memorandums, and the covert involvement of the Soviets and other intelligence agencies\u2014culminating in a final decision placed in the hands of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. \nSet against the backdrop of Cold War Delhi on the cusp of liberalisation, the novel paints a vivid portrait of a nation\u2014and capital\u2014torn between ideologies and ambitions. The Soviet Union may have vanished, lobbyists have receded from public corridors, and few can claim first\u2011hand knowledge of that era. \nIn\u00a0Confessions of a Lobbyist, Siddharth Raja\u2014a lawyer, historian, and bibliophile\u2014sits down with Ramjee Chandran to peel back the layers of this story, offering an insider\u2019s glimpse into a world that feels at once distant and disarmingly relevant. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks,\u00a0Ramjee Chandran will be in conversation with Siddharth Raja. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in Aug 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favourite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Overcast, Audible, and Amazon Music. \n",
