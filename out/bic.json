    "description": "Midlife is a phase when we find ourselves pulled in multiple directions\u2014across work, home, health, friendships, and hobbies. \nIn this session, Ravi Venkatesan delves into themes from Deepak Jayaraman\u2019s recent book, Play to Potential. The book offers a nuanced exploration of how to unlock human potential\u2014not just professionally but holistically\u2014by embracing life\u2019s highs and lows. Drawing from his acclaimed Play to Potential podcast and his experiences as a coach, Deepak introduces the FLAVOUR framework, a practical guide to navigating the intricate interplay of family, aspirations, values, and relationships. \nDeepak emphasises that life is a team sport, with family serving as an essential support system. He argues that personal growth and achievement are deeply intertwined with our family contexts, a perspective often overlooked in self-help literature, particularly in cultures where family plays a central role. \nA key insight of the book is the recognition that life unfolds in seasons, shaped by transitions\u2014some intentional, others unexpected. Using real-life examples and case studies, Deepak illustrates how navigating these transitions thoughtfully is vital to realising our potential. \nThis discussion will resonate with anyone in their 30s to 60s, offering valuable strategies to lead a multi-dimensional, purposeful life. \n",

    "description": "Being immune to the charms of poetry is a crime that is its own punishment, the Sanskritic tradition tells us. Join us as we discover the allure of Sanskrit and Prakrit love poetry and the travails of translating doe-eyes and elephant-thighs into English with Anusha Rao and Suhas Mahesh, co-translators of the verse anthology, How to Love in Sanskrit (HarperCollins 2024). \nHow to Love in Sanskrit is a poetic exploration of the maze of modern dating: flirting, daydreaming, yearning, and breaking up, through the eyes of Kalidasa, Bana, Vidya, and many other, often anonymous gifted poets. \nModerated by Radhika Chadha, the translators will discuss their inspiration for the book, their approach to translation, misconceptions about Sanskrit poetry, and the challenges of translating pre-modern poetry, drawing from both classic and forgotten texts to paint a picture of what love feels like in Sanskrit. The session will conclude with a reading of their favourite verses from the book. \n",

    "description": "The lecture will explore efforts to engage the public in conserving India\u2019s extraordinary plant diversity. This diversity forms the foundation of our diverse ecosystems, nourishes us, sustains our health, mitigates climate change, and offers spiritual, recreational, and other invaluable benefits. Vijay Thiruvady utilized botanical gardens like Lalbagh to showcase India\u2019s plant wealth and inspire the public to contribute to safeguarding our natural heritage. Professor Bawa will highlight\u00a0 ATREE\u2019s recent, innovative initiatives aimed at connecting scientists, students, and the general public to the world of plants. These efforts could promote deeper interactions with nature and continue Vijay Thiruvady\u2019s enduring legacy. \n \nWith this programme, the Bangalore International Centre remembers the contributions of our member Vijay Thiruvady in three landmark lectures that he gave at the BIC, on the \u201cGreening of Bangalore\u201d with Girish Karnad and Capt. Prabhala (2015), on \u201cBotanical Illustrations\u201d with Nirupa Rao (2019), and on \u201cWhy Lalbagh Matters\u201d (2021). \nVijay Thiruvady was always interested in various aspects of nature and more specifically horticulture. Among the accounts of our city, his book Lalbagh \u2013 Sultans\u2019 Garden to Public Park presents the most comprehensive history of Lalbagh written to date. Ranging across five centuries, it draws on various archives and on his own intimate knowledge of Lalbagh having conducted inspiring nature walks for over 18 years that were attended by over 15,000 walkers. In addition to the Green Heritage Walks in Lalbagh, he conducted Imperial Colonial Walks in Cubbon Park and Military Heritage Walks at the MEG&C, and participated in the various activities of Bangalore Environment Trust as a Trustee. These have included the publishing of notable books on Heritage Trees in and around Bangalore and on Devarakadus and Gundutopus in the vicinity of Bangalore. \nThiruvady spent his early years in Delhi. His academic interests were pursued at St. Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi and School of Architecture, Ahmedabad. When in Delhi, he had exposure to the world of nature and environment through association with a number of distinguished people in the field and institutions. \nIn his later years, he gave talks on Bangalore, its environment and history at many institutions. A gifted raconteur, his encyclopedic knowledge of trees and of Bangalore\u2019s history were conveyed through stories that kindled a love of nature and made his walks, lectures and books memorable, connecting with young and old from around the world, from experts in the field to school children.\u00a0His passing in August 2023 was a profound loss to the city. \nVijay Thiruvady\u2019s talk on Lalbagh at the BIC, which has been widely viewed as an introduction to the botanical garden and to Bangalore and its history, is available here. \nHis short essays on trees are available here. \nAn article about him in Frontline magazine is available here. \nImage Captions \nThumbnail and Poster: Impatiens species from the Himalaya \nHeader and Instastory: Rhododendron arboreum in the Himalaya\u00a0 \nJoseph Hooker, the British botanist, on his plant collecting expedition in the Himalaya (1847-1851) gathered over twenty-five species of Rhododendron and wrote The Rhododendrons of Sikkim-Himalaya. He was also fascinated by the diversity of Impatiens (balsams or poor man\u2019s orchids) there and wrote to Charles Darwin about this incredible diversity. More than 100 species have been added from India since Hooker\u2019s account of Impatiens, and many remain to be discovered. \n\u00a0 \nTea will be served at 11 am. \n",

The research offers insights into patronage, methodologies, emergent technologies, and construction techniques and also sheds light on how the humane and social aspects of architecture characterized by participatory frameworks are being approached by practitioners today. It attempts to highlight modes of engagement as well as transgressions and synergies between disparate cultures, ways of representation, and knowledge accumulation and production. The first edition of the exhibition was shown at the India International Centre, New Delhi in December 2023, followed by the first travel edition at the Alliance Francaise, Chennai in August 2024. \nThe exhibition is part of the research project \u2013 State of Architecture in South Asia, which aims to collectively ask, across South Asia, the question: Does Architecture matter in a state of transition? In the region, numerous transitions, and uncertainties, encompassing climate change, political transformations, and socio-economic shifts, manifest in a heightened form within the daily existence of its populace. \u00a0A project initiated by the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University \u00a0and the Architecture Foundation, \u00a0visit https://www.soasouthasia.com for more details on the project. \nThe Travelling exhibition is produced by Prakriti Foundation and the Architecture Foundation \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Ancient Sanskrit literature mentions the veena as the instrument used to accompany vedic chants, very much like the organ that was used in the Roman catholic church for the Gregorian chants. The earliest instruments used grass reeds and animal guts as strings for plucking and the joke is that the musicians still use \u201cGrass\u201d. As music developed from folk to classical, desi and Marg Sangeeth, as described in ancient texts like Natya Shastra of\u00a0 Bharata Muni of the 3rd Century AD, and later Sarangadeva of the 11th Century, the sophistication of playing techniques has advanced. \nIn today\u2019s musical presentation , the audience will witness the use of hybrid electronic veenas as a part of this sophistication and progress, without watering down the gravity and authenticity of the musical form as described in voluminous texts on Indian classical music. \nArtists: \nShanthi Rao and Neeraja Krishnamurthy :Veena\nK.N.Uma Maheshwari :Keyboard\nN.Vasudeva : Mridangam\nSubba Rao :\u00a0Ghatam \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "2023 | 80 mins | English with subtitles \nLink to the trailer. \nOver half a century ago, India embarked on a pioneering journey to safeguard its tigers. Since then, the world has lost two-thirds of its wildlife, and India\u2019s human population has surged to 1.4 billion. Yet, India\u2019s tiger population has more than doubled, and the country is now home to approximately 70% of the world\u2019s last wild tigers. \nHowever, the path to this extraordinary achievement has been far from straightforward. This film takes you into the backstage of India\u2019s biggest and most ambitious wildlife conservation journey, narrating some untold stories that formed their legacy. But this is more than just a story of conservation. It\u2019s a tale of hope, resilience, and the bond between nature and the Indians. \nThe film showcases how the project has evolved over five decades, highlighting not only the triumphs but also the setbacks, controversies, and compromises made along the way. With an in-depth look at the complexities of tiger conservation, right from political challenges to poaching pressures, you will gain a deeper understanding of the immense efforts required to protect this iconic species. The film also sheds light on the steps needed to ensure that tigers continue to roam freely in India\u2019s forests for generations to come. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A session with the film\u2019s producer, Kalyan Varma. \n",

    "description": "The Constitution came into force on 26 January 1950. This session of The Forum asks, has the Constitution succeeded (so far)? \nEminent Senior Advocate Arvind Datar would say yes. In a recent talk celebrating the \u201cIndian Constitution @ 75 Years\u201d, he reminded us that most fledgling post-colonial states saw their experiments with democracy fail. By contrast, India\u2019s \u201cimprobable democracy\u201d survived the 20th Century, even in the face of existential threats. \nThen, how are we to make sense of India\u2019s current backsliding on global democracy rankings? How are we to respond to those who tell us that our fundamental rights and democratic institutions are in decline? We might worry that the Constitution is no longer fit for purpose. Yet, equally, we might see the Constitution as the only thing standing between us and tyranny. In short,\u00a0is the Constitution failing us? Or, are we failing the Constitution? \nIn this session, we will engage with these questions both by examining contemporary constitutional controversies and attempting to place them in the historical context of India\u2019s founding. \nNo prior knowledge of constitutional law is required.  \nThis is the third of our sessions titled,\u00a0The Forum,\u00a0a series of engaging discussions held at the BIC Library. Our goal is to bring together individuals from all walks of life,\u00a0ages 15 to 50, to discuss topics of importance in a setting that is both informed and informal. Whether you\u2019re passionate about current events, social issues, or cultural topics,\u00a0The Forum\u00a0provides a platform for open dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas.\u00a0Inspired by the ancient Roman forums, where citizens gathered to discuss and debate the issues of the day, these sessions aim to revive this tradition of community dialogue. \n",

A journey, through the Guru-Shishya landscape as it formed and evolved over the years. Get an inside glimpse into the world of Prabhaji\u2019s approach to the fascinating process of musical creativity and development of the artistic temperament, which cemented her position as one of the foremost exponents in the world of Hindustani Classical Music. \nThis concert is held in remembrance of Dr. Prabha Atre, marking one year since her passing on January 13, 2024. \nSupported by: \n \n",
