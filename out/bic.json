    "description": "This session\u00a0presents an enthralling journey through the rich history of the sitar, beginning with its origins and evolution across centuries. The performance explores the sitar\u2019s creation from natural elements, merging Persian and Indian musical traditions to symbolize its sacred and timeless nature. As the sitar travels through royal courts, it becomes a symbol of refinement and cultural prestige, before eventually establishing itself as a central instrument in Indian classical music. This concert highlights the transformation, showcasing the sitar\u2019s rise as a solo instrument and its deep connection to Indian music. \nHonoring the contributions of legendary sitarists like Ustad Vilayat Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar, this performance will illustrate their groundbreaking innovations that shaped the sitar\u2019s modern identity and global influence. From classical Indian ragas to cross-cultural experiments, the sitar\u2019s role in contemporary music will be explored, demonstrating its versatility and ongoing relevance in world music. Through a blend of storytelling and music, this performance celebrates the instrument\u2019s enduring legacy and its profound impact on both classical and global music. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Some industrial chimneys belch smoke while others have\u00a0trees growing out of them. This is the landscape of West Bengal\u2019s 165-year-old jute industry, which\u00a0once produced the ubiquitous gunny bags, rope, and jute textiles used by trade and commerce\u00a0around the world. Almost all of these functions have been largely replaced by plastic, which is\u00a0perhaps more durable but certainly environmentally disastrous. \nNearly forgotten, the jute industry is attracting renewed interest in the golden fibre due to its eco-friendly qualities. At the same time, the jute industry is in turmoil. A few mills remain in operation,\u00a0with frequent shutdowns and lockouts to replace workers with precision machines. Can\u00a0environmental concern recuperate a future for jute and for jute workers while there is still time? \nThe\u00a0Golden Thread contemplates itself as a product of an encounter between jute workers, early industrial machines, and jute fibre. What was an unwanted fibre for 50 years is now being hailed as\u00a0the \u2018fibre of the future\u2019. The act of filming is an act of archiving \u2013documenting a past that has\u00a0continued into the future, fade away. \nFilmmaker Nishtha Jain will be in conversation with Gautam Sonti after the screening.

This session delves into the starkly different roles played by the military in the political landscapes of India and Pakistan, and how these choices have shaped the democratic trajectories of both nations. While Pakistan\u2019s history is marked by frequent military interventions that have hindered its democratic development, India\u2019s military has remained notably apolitical, even in moments of crisis such as the 1962 Sino-Indian War, the Emergency, and Operation Blue Star. \nExplore the critical moments where India\u2019s military could have intervened but chose to uphold democratic principles, contrasting with Pakistan\u2019s history of military dominance in politics. The discussion will also include insights into Bangladesh\u2019s unique experiments with democracy and military rule. This session offers a rare opportunity to understand how the military\u2019s influence\u2014or restraint\u2014can define a nation\u2019s political destiny. \nThe author, Aditya Sondhi will be in conversation with Journalist, Aunohita Mojumdar.

Do you crave connection, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends\u2026 Yet, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together, drifting apart, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise\u2026 \nThis is an adaptation of \u201cBh\u016bmikampa \u2013 Das Erdbeben\u201d which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n\u201cMira and Sameer find themselves on a bench, surrounded by unspoken words. \u2018The Earthquake\u2019 delves into the essence of human relationships\u2014our connections, routines, distances, and all the spaces in between. It asks us what it means to be truly seen or heard. What happens when we finally face the unspoken truths in our interpersonal relationships?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0 \nCredits: \nPlaywrights: Marvin Krause and Samragni Dasgupta\nDirector: Samragni Dasgupta \nCast: \nMira: Yamuna Kali\nSameer: Naman Roy \nThe Earthquake received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt M\u00fcnchen Kulturreferat (City of Munich). \nProduced by\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nWith Support from \n\n \n\n",

    "description": "Bengaluru, India\u2019s economic engine, is a water-starved city. The Cauvery river, its lifeline, is\u00a0drying up and severely polluted, while the Western Ghats forests, where its waters originate, are rapidly degrading. Yet, the government continues to push for unsound projects like the\u00a0Mekedatu Dam and Yettinahole Drinking Water project, further damaging the rivers and forests\u00a0that sustain us. Amid this, the city remains disconnected from its rivers, yet perpetually thirsty. \nThis session will begin with a discussion followed by songs about rivers sung by children and an English adaptation of Komal\u00a0Swaminathan\u2019s 1980 satirical Tamil play Thaneer Thaneer. Set in a drought-ridden village in Tamil Nadu, the play follows a stranger who helps the villagers harness water against political and natural challenges, showing the power of a community deeply connected to its water sources. \nPaani.Earth, a citizen-led think tank, is dedicated to river conservation. The team will share\u00a0their efforts to protect the rivers that sustain us. Through this session, they aim to foster a deep\u00a0understanding and compassion for rivers \u2014 crucial for meaningful change. \n",
