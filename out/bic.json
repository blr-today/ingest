    "description": "Mandala, is a journey through the themes of Shringara (love), Viraha (separation), Maya (illusion), and Aikya (dissolution). It is a dialogue between the dancer and the singer, using poetry from saint poets of India, including Kabir, Annamacharya, Kshettraya and Kanakadasa. \nA recurring message of all saint-poets across time, is the reminder that enjoyment, pain, delight, struggle are all fleeting- this too shall pass. They remind us to savour the world, be fully present in it, while simultaneously remembering that nothing is permanent. How does one save oneself from the web of Maya- the entrapment of the illusion? The saints offer an answer to this as well. Bhakti- devotion. \nAnd where is the divine in whom we must have faith? In the mosques? In the temples? East? Or West? The divine is within each of us. \nIt is a poetic journey that traces the path from the outer circle of love to separation, to disillusionment, to the ultimate realization that we are one at the core. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Surely not. How did they nurture prosperity? What were the economic models that enabled them to leave the world awestruck? \nSriram Balasubramanian\u2019s sequel to the pathbreaking Kautilyanomics answers these questions by examining Common Era empires and kingdoms ranging from the Cholas, Pallavas, Pandyas and Vijayanagara to Southeast Asian kingdoms. Balasubramanian audaciously puts forward a novel, indigenous and sustainable framework called Dharmanomics\u2014a function of Kautilyan Dharmic capitalism, of a Dharmic ecosystem driven by temples and Sreni (corporate guilds) Dharma\u2014that spans thousands of years. It was put into practice much before the likes of Adam Smith and modern economic thinkers.\u00a0Dharmanomics seeks to present a coherent and structured economic framework based on the idea of Dharma for at least 1500 years. \nIn the session, Sriram Balasubramanian will share the key aspects from his book.

He was an early proponent of economic planning and rapid, large-scale industrialization, which he believed were essential for national development.\u00a0 \nYet he has remained an enigmatic figure. Despite his legendary status, little is known about the man, his strengths and foibles, the conflicts and negotiations involved in his career. How do we assess his technical achievements against those of his professional contemporaries? What were the intellectual and professional influences that shaped him? In what ways did his background as an engineer mould his conception of economic development? How were his essentially technocratic views received in his lifetime, and what do we make of them today? \nThese are some of the key questions that Aparajith Ramnath explores in Engineering a Nation. Based on in-depth archival research, field visits, and interviews, the book provides a vivid portrait of Visvesvaraya\u2019s eight-decade-long public career. Throughout, it highlights the historical context in which he worked. To explore Visvesvaraya\u2019s life, the book argues, is to understand the emergence of the Indian nation itself. \nThe author will be in conversation with Dr. Jahnavi Phalkey, followed by an audience Q&A. \n",

    "description": "Sanjay Mittal\u2019s presentation begins with an intriguing comparison of how air flows around projectiles in various sports, from the spinning flight of a soccer ball to the subtle aerodynamics of a golf ball. Drawing on data from experiments conducted at IIT Kanpur\u2019s National Wind Tunnel Facility, he takes the audience on a journey across the fields and courts of sports like baseball, cricket, tennis, volleyball, and badminton. \nIn professional badminton, players prefer duck-feather shuttlecocks for their unique feel and flight characteristics. However, these shuttlecocks are fragile and costly, so nylon substitutes are common in recreational play. Prof. Mittal will explore how these synthetic shuttlecocks differ aerodynamically from the traditional feathered ones, illuminating the role of fluid-structure interactions that make them fly\u2014and feel\u2014so differently in the air. \nCricket fans can look forward to a deep dive into the mysteries of swing and reverse swing. Can a new cricket ball actually reverse swing? Prof. Mittal answers this question by presenting results from wind-tunnel experiments and Large Eddy Simulations. He\u2019ll explain why cricketers shine one side of the ball and how the roughness on one hemisphere affects the ball\u2019s trajectory, enabling \u201ccontrast-swing.\u201d With data from carefully conducted experiments on both new and worn balls, he\u2019ll show how different surface textures create distinct swing behaviors that bowlers use to baffle batters. \nProf. Mittal then shifts focus to the \u201cknuckleball,\u201d which has gained attention in cricket, though he notes it\u2019s a bit of a misnomer. Borrowing insights from baseball, he proposes a model to capture the peculiar movement of a true knuckleball, dissecting the optimal seam angle, speed, and spin rate at release that make this delivery so elusive for batters. \nTo wrap up, he will delve into the aerodynamics of a frisbee. With every flick and spin, the frisbee dances on a layer of air, a perfect example of how the subtle interaction of shape and flow can lead to graceful, unpredictable motion. \nProf. Mittal\u2019s lecture will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. Mr. Srinath will offer his comments at the end. \nHigh Tea will be served before the event from 10:30am onwards. \nThis lecture is a part of RRI\u2019s Vignyana Kathegalu, a series of popular talks on science. \nPresented by:\u00a0Raman Research Institute, Bangalore \n \n",

    "description": "Indian healthcare is at a critical crossroads. \nThere has been significant improvement in the control of morbidity due to communicable diseases. On the other hand, non-communicable diseases have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Simple community based interventions like sanitation, clean water supply, vector eradication and vaccination under nationwide program initiatives helped control communicable diseases. Similar strategies do not exist for non-communicable diseases, where the prevailing paradigm is the reactive use of expensive curative services. To some extent, the burden on patients who paid for such services out of pocket has been reduced by increase in capacity and supply of curative services under schemes like Ayushman Bharat. \nHowever, in a system where providers control the levers of consumption, for-profit providers are incentivized to artificially stoke consumption until demand once again catches up with supply, setting up a vicious spiral of inflation in healthcare costs. Scaling up such a supply led healthcare system, in order to make healthcare universally accessible, is a recipe for unsustainable increases in healthcare costs. \nThe book Mission Possible takes a hard look at the realities of Indian healthcare and provides a way out of the unsustainable trajectory it finds itself in. Instead of considering the pieces of healthcare in isolation, it promotes a systemwide analysis of the problems. Based on their analysis, the authors have not hesitated to propose radical structural changes in the current system, while providing commentary on why these changes are necessary and how they could be realized. \nA panel discussion with the authors\u00a0Swami Subramaniam and Aparajithan Srivathsan along with Meena Ganesh (Founder, Portea), Ashok Vellodi (Paediatrician) and Arvind Kasturi (Professor, Community Health, St\u00a0Johns\u00a0Medical College) will be followed by a Q&A Session. \nTea/ Coffee will be served from 5:30pm onwards. \nIn collaboration with the UHC Dialogues \n \n",
