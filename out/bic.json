This talk will feature in-depth analysis of short films and excerpts from longer essay films in different genres that include actuality, observational documentary, found-footage film and autobiography, to look at the complex ways in which film\u2019s formal elements come together to create meaning while drawing on our lived experience. \nDay 2\n24 August | Saturday \n10:30 am\nScreening: Night and Fog\nAlain Resnais | 1956 | 32 mins\nThis poignant and harrowing documentary reflects on the horrors of Nazi concentration camps, blending historical footage with contemporary observations to evoke the stark reality of genocide and the importance of remembering its lessons. \nScreening: La Jet\u00e9e\nChris Marker | 1962 | 28 mins\nIn a post-apocalyptic future, a man is sent back in time to explore the past and find a way to save humanity, but his journey leads him to an unexpected and haunting conclusion. This innovative sci-fi short film is told almost entirely through still photographs.\n \n12:15 pm\nDigital Afterlives of Films\nTalks by\u00a0Chlo\u00e9 Galibert-La\u00een\u00e9 and\u00a0Ritika Kaushik\nChlo\u00e9 Galibert-La\u00een\u00e9:\u00a0In this deeply personal video diary, a young researcher tries to make sense of her fascination for the film \u201cThe Pain of Others\u201d by Penny Lane. A deep dive into the discomforting world of YouTube and online conspiracies, that challenges traditional notions of what documentary cinema is or should be.\nRitika Kaushik:\u00a0Ritika Kaushik will consider the video essay as a form for examining the digital afterlives of films from the past. Kaushik\u2019s talk will take us through her formal experiments with online and desktop interactions and how they can enliven archival and contemporary digital materials to bring out new configurations of film historiography. She will specifically discuss the \u2018reaction video\u2019 as an essayistic technique for creating an embodied and affective engagement with pre-existing audiovisual media. \n2:30 pm\nThe making of an Essay Film \u2013 Impetus and Discovery\nA Talk by Sameera Jain\nStemming from a practitioner\u2019s perspective, the session looks at some recent short films and traces their journeys of making. We find that the form appears through a search for a relationship with image, sound, time, meaning and affect, a pursuit that is not governed by existing formulations, but by the creative processes in practice. The talk will attempt to unpack phases in these navigations and present how the cinema essay is \u2018found\u2019, reflecting on the openness, expanse, fluidity and inclusivity of the form. In addition, referencing contemporary and historical cinema, we explore facets of the essay film, walking through with some examples. \n4:30 pm\nScreening: Films from the Creative Documentary Course, SACAC, New Delhi\n\u2022 I Am Yet to See Delhi by Humaira Bilkis | 2014 | 19 mins\n\u2022 Jamnapaar by Abhinava Bhattacharyya | 2017 | 24 mins\n\u2022 Chadariya by Nimisha Srivastava | 2022 | 25 mins \n6:30 pm\nScreening:\u00a0Tales from Planet Kolkata\nRuchir Joshi | 1993 | 38 mins\nTales from Planet Kolkata anticipates the period Calcutta was approaching in the early 90s: the wasteland of violent traffic, the orgy of rampant construction, the severing of old traditions, the rise of cynical politics, the strange, once again subservient relationship with the west. Seeing it today, it\u2019s startling how much of it still resonates with the city Calcutta/Kolkata has become. Part fiction, part spoof, part essay, part documentary, the film weaves together disparate strands: a critique of Western media\u2019s construction, from the 1960s to the 1990s; of Calcutta as \u2018the black hole\u2019 and \u2018the worst place in the world\u2019; an \u2018elegy\u2019 to Deepak Majumdar, one of\u00a0 Calcutta\u2019s great intellectual mavericks, a teacher and friend to Joshi and many others, who died while the film was being made; and the images and song of a patua \u2013 a traditional Bengali scroll-painter. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with the director, Ruchir Joshi. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nDay 3\n25 August | Sunday \n10:30 am\nScreening: Looking for Horses\nStefan Pavlovic | 2021 | 88 mins\nTravelling to Bosnia in search of his origins, filmmaker Stefan Pavlovic\u0301 meets a solitary fisherman. One man has language impairment, the other lost his hearing during the war. Camera in hand, the director films the onset of this improbable and profound friendship. \n12:15 pm\nEat your Mother and Father\nA Talk by Yashaswini Raghunandan\nIn this session we will look at how filmmakers weave in their families and themselves to expand the conversations around identity, alienation and political histories. Through the films \u2018Looking for Horses\u2019 by Stefan Pavlovic, \u2018Will you look at me?\u2019 by Shuli Huang and \u2018A picture of you\u2019 by Ajay Naronha, we will look at how the essay is constructed through the making of the film, revealing an intimate side of filmmaking. All three filmmakers use filmmaking as a method to ask difficult questions and to re-connect, allowing for some form of catharsis. \n2:30 pm\nEssay Film and the Voice\nA Talk by Matthew Barrington\nIn this session we explore the complexities of voice as both a narrative device and a vehicle for personal expression, as we examine its transformative power in shaping cinematic discourse. From subjective introspection to objective analysis, we unpack how the voice navigates the intricate intersections of truth, perspective, and interpretation within the essay film landscape. The voice as subjective \u2013 departing from a dominant, authoritative narrator. \n4:30 pm\nNon-Narratives with Conceptual Extensions\nA Talk by Vasanthi Mariadass\nVisual essays are noted for non-narrative style. A re-editing to re-narrate stories untold or less told. I engage with works by Ursula Biemann, and Harun Farocki, to examine their theoretical insertions through the visual form.\u00a0 I would not just call them visual essays but an unfolding of visual theory.\u00a0 Images collide or they are quietly juxtaposed, despite the events and topics coming from different spaces, times, and seemingly unrelated topics/images, hence refreshing found images and concepts. Conceptual works by Biemann relate to Environmental concerns and Farocki\u2019s concept examines an already established idea such as the enlightenment but rethinks and retells other not-so-visible concepts such as perfection and precision that silently negotiate the development of scientific and technological production. \n6:30 pm\nScreening:\u00a0Night and Fear (Raati O Bhaya)\nLipika Singh Darai | 2023 | 28 mins\nThe residuals of recorded material generated by the filmmaker over a decade of filmmaking practice, with the passing of time, have acquired new meaning. With a range of experiences \u2013 from a local witch hunt to a meeting with a stunning waterfall \u2013 the past, the present, the fear and the intuitive self, have found shelter in the characters and spaces from the world captured through image and sound which have aged just enough to correlate and run a parallel narrative. Having a twofold interior, Night and Fear is a personal essay addressed to the filmmaker\u2019s late grand aunt, but also a reflection on the impact of making films \u2013 on the filmmaker herself and the society. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by Q&A with the Director. \nScreening: Letter From Your Far-Off Country\nSuneil Sanzgiri | 2020 | 18 mins\nShot with 16mm film stock that expired in 2002\u2014the same year as the state-sponsored anti-Muslim genocide in Gujarat\u2014and filmed amid the anti-CAA protests in Delhi, the filmmaker traces lines and lineages of ancestral memory, poetry, history, songs, and ruins from his birth in 1989. \nScreening: Golden Jubilee\nSuneil Sanzgiri | 2021 | 19 mins\nWhat is liberation when so much has already been taken? Who has come for more? \u2018Golden Jubilee\u2019, takes as its starting point scenes of the filmmaker\u2019s father navigating a virtual rendering of their ancestral home in Goa, India, created using the same technologies of surveillance that mining companies use to map locations for iron ore in the region. A tool for extraction and exploitation becomes a method for preservation. The father, sparked by a memory of an encounter as a child, inhabits the voice of a spirit known locally as Devchar, whose task is to protect the workers, farmers, and the once communal lands of Goa. Protection from what the filmmaker asks. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n",

Alongside accounts of the plight of the vulnerable and the transformative power of mass-based grassroot social movements, her recollections are marked with stories of resilient individuals and communities and their extraordinary resistance to oppression.\u00a0Roy recounts a powerful lesson learnt from her extraordinary life: that every issue, whether it is poverty, discrimination, inequality or corruption, has personal as well as political ramifications. It is only by connecting the personal and the political, Roy says, that each one of us can make a difference. \nIn this session,\u00a0Aruna Roy will be in conversation with Aakar Patel, alongside TM Krishna, Deepa Ganesh and Gautam Bhan.

    "description": "In the early 1970s, India was experiencing severe poverty and hunger due to the great droughts of the previous decade. Although the Green Revolution was starting, agriculture and rural issues were largely ignored by urban residents and the media. Reports on monsoons, crops, and prices were seldom highlighted, lacking the appeal for widespread attention. Significant studies like those by V M Dandekar and Nilkanth Rath on poverty were published in specialised journals and went unnoticed by the general public. As a result, rural despair, evident then as now, remained hidden from mainstream discussion. \nFast forward to the third decade of the twenty-first century, and rural India, or Bharat, significantly lags behind urban areas in terms of income, infrastructure, governance, education, and healthcare. This gap has widened, especially since India\u2019s economic growth accelerated over the last thirty years. Numerous initiatives over the past seven decades by the government, private sector, and civil organisations aimed at rural development have had mixed results, often falling short of expectations. While there have been significant achievements, they are isolated instances rather than widespread improvements. Additionally, resource scarcity, particularly water, has become a critical issue, yet remains largely ignored. \nThe pressing challenge is to connect these isolated successes, despite the difficult conditions, to create a more prosperous rural landscape. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Prof. Shreekant Sambrani, delves deeper into these issues to explore potential solutions. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in July 2024. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!

    "description": "Violinists Trina Basu and Arun Ramamurthy present their debut album, Nakshatra. This lush and spiritual collaboration bridges traditions and defies genres, blending South Indian classical music, Western chamber music, and jazz improvisation. The album\u2019s title, a Sanskrit word for constellations and interconnectedness, encapsulates its expansive sound, created by two violins in sublime harmony. \nNakshatra\u00a0is a cinematic work that conveys a sense of two souls conversing across centuries. Rooted in diverse musical traditions, Trina and Arun reimagine the potential of string chamber music with a unique sound described by The New Yorker as \u201cfree-flowing and globe-spanning,\u201d and by The Guardian as resonating \u201cwith the power of an ancient drone, revivified by a fearless, contemporary spirit.\u201d This album, five years in the making, is a testament to the duo\u2019s fluency in improvisation, offering a deeply intimate yet grand musical experience. Join us for an evening that promises to be both introspective and expansive, celebrating the intricate interplay of two violinists. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "This talk by Dr Charan Singh will explore the recent Union Budget, a crucial point in India\u2019s financial evolution. This first budget from the current administration highlights Youth, Farmers, Women, and the Poor, with a focus on employment, skill development, MSMEs, and the middle class. \nThe budget\u2019s nine key areas include agriculture, employment and skilling, social justice, manufacturing and services, urban development, energy security, infrastructure, innovation, and next-gen reforms.

A vision document for the financial sector has been introduced to guide future developments. \nThe talk will be followed by a fireside chat with Prof Narendar Pani and a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "What went wrong with capitalism? Ruchir Sharma\u2019s account is not like any you will have heard before. He says progressives are right, in part, when they mock modern capitalism as \u201csocialism for the rich.\u201d For a century, governments have expanded in just about every measurable dimension, from spending to regulation and the scale of financial rescues when the economy wobbles. The result is expensive state guarantees for everyone\u2014bailouts for the rich, entitlements for the middle class, welfare for the poor. \nTaking you back to the 19th century, Sharma shows how completely the reflexes of government have changed: from hands-off to hands-on, from doing too little to help anyone in hard times to today trying to prevent anyone suffering any economic pain, ever. Trading sins of omission and indifference for excesses of spending and meddling, governments from the United States to Europe and Japan have pumped so much money into their economies that financial markets can no longer invest all that capital efficiently. \nInadvertently, they have fueled the rise of monopolies, \u201czombie\u201d firms, and billionaires. They have made capitalism less fair and less efficient, which is slowing economic growth and fueling popular anger. The first step to a cure is a correct diagnose of the problem. Capitalism has been badly distorted by constant government intervention and the relentless spread of a bailout culture. Building an even bigger state will only double down on what ruined capitalism in the first place. \nThe author, Ruchir Sharma, will be in conversation with\u00a0Chairman and Co-founder, Infosys and Founding Chairman\u00a0UIDAI\u00a0(Aadhaar), Nandan Nilekani. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "There are songs written by poets, saints and artists based on thought provoking phrases found in epics, shastras and other ancient literary works.\u00a0These songs inspire dancers to expand and interpret the ideas to create dances. These dances are timeless, and hold the audience and dancers together. Sharmila Biswas brings four such dances to the audience of Bangalore. \nVilasini:\u00a0Reminiscence of an old temple dancer of Puri. \nKundalika:\u00a0Designing spirals in space and in body. \nMaya-Manav:\u00a0Man\u2019s eternal quest for the unattainable. \nEvoking Radha:\u00a0A fantasy world, which every woman longs for, while living her mundane life. \nThe special treatment given to each makes these four dances interesting. The high spirited and humorous old Devdasi describing her fineries, a dancer connecting the inner spirals with the outer, exploration of traditional theatre styles of Odisha, combining Vachik Abhinaya with dance, are some of the highlights of Vahuvachan. \nSupported by:\n \n",
