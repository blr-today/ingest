    "description": "When the world shifts, what anchors a nation\u2019s choices? \nThe Bengaluru launch of India\u2019s Tryst With the World: A Foreign Policy Manifesto arrives at a moment of visible churn in India\u2019s external relations. With shifts in United States policy under a second Trump presidency, long-assumed alignments have grown uncertain; prompting rapid recalibrations toward China, renewed invocations of friendship with Russia, and fresh questions about strategic autonomy. The book frames this moment not as disruption alone, but as an opportunity to rethink how India engages the world. \nCo-edited by Salman Khurshid and Salil Shetty, the volume sets the stage for a wide-ranging conversation on diplomacy, values, and global responsibility. Joined by Nirupama Rao, the evening reflects on India\u2019s foreign policy record and its evolving role in a post-Trump international order: inviting careful listening, debate, and reflection as the contours of the future come into view. \n",

    "description": "80 minutes | English & Marathi with English subtitles | India | 2025 \nScholarship and resistance bridged by love. \nA documentary that traces the shared journey of US-born Indian sociologist and Dalit rights activist Dr. Gail Omvedt and activist-intellectual Dr. Bharat Patankar, this film situates their personal story within the larger arc of India\u2019s socio-political movements. Charting Omvedt\u2019s path from America to western Maharashtra, her deep engagement with Dalit-Bahujan politics, and a life of thought and action shaped alongside Patankar, Gail & Bharat\u00a0brings out the personal in the political. \nSet largely in Kasegaon, where the couple lived and worked for decades, the film foregrounds voices and struggles long ignored by mainstream media and academia. It reflects Omvedt\u2019s seminal contributions to anti-caste studies and her role in building global intellectual conversations around Phule and Ambedkar, while also capturing Patankar\u2019s grassroots leadership through movements for land, water, and dignity. Tender, political, and quietly moving, the documentary preserves the legacy of two organic intellectuals whose lives blurred the boundaries between scholarship, activism, and everyday care. \nThe screening will be followed by a conversation between filmmaker Somnath Waghmare and investigative journalist Sudipto Mondal, and will subsequently conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

This documentary reveals the cost of this misnaming. Not only is the survival of species such as the blackbuck, caracal, and great Indian bustard at risk, but also a deeper understanding of how life persists in these seemingly spare terrains. \nMoving beyond wildlife portraiture, the film traces the intricate web of life sustained by grasslands, weaving together ecological science, lived knowledge, and cultural memory. Through voices of local communities, researchers, and conservationists, it challenges the hierarchy of what is deemed worthy of care, asking what happens when we fail to protect what is not glorified. \nThis film is a mark of the wider movement calling for attention, humility, and responsibility toward ecosystems that quietly sustain us all. \nThe screening is followed by a conversation with filmmaker Sumanth Kuduvalli and behavioural ecologist Kavita Isvaran, concluding with an audience Q&A. \n",

    "description": "How far would you go for love? \nIn this session author Madhavi Mahadevan and Lakshmi Sankar explore elopement; an act often romanticized but rooted in complex societal conflict. Joining the discussion are speakers from varied backgrounds: a classical dancer who interprets myths through movement, a storyteller who uncovers mythology in India\u2019s living traditions and a legal expert who grounds these narratives in present-day realities. \nThe conversation will trace how mythology shapes our understanding of love and rebellion. From classic texts to contemporary cinema, from mainstream retellings to folk traditions, whose voices get prioritized? How do different modes of storytelling influence what we consider acceptable defiance? And did earlier societies view elopement as a legitimate response when love collided with social expectations, or has our romanticization of it obscured more complex truths? \nAn evening that moves between myth and modernity, romance and reality. \n",

    "description": "Crossing genres and geographies, this performance is truly unique. \nThe Vishnu, Davis & Haleigh project is a genre-defying crossover that brings together the richness of Indian ragas and rhythms with the expansiveness of American folk and jazz harmony into a shared soundscape. This collaboration began as a musical conversation across distance: between Appalachian folk traditions rooted in storytelling, the improvisational language of jazz, and the raga-based imagination of Indian classical music. \nDavis & Haleigh, a violin and acoustic guitar duo from Birmingham, Alabama, come together with Bengaluru-based Carnatic fusion artist Vishnu R\u2014an award-winning performer and inventor of the Navtar\u2014to explore what happens when distinct musical lineages meet without hierarchy, and with curiosity leading the way. Bridging traditions of the East and the West, the trio seamlessly blends Carnatic, folk, jazz, and blues, bringing centuries-old traditions into dialogue with innovative modern artistry. \nAt the heart of the performance is dialogue: between strings and rhythm, structure and spontaneity, memory and invention. Davis & Haleigh\u2019s intricate interplay is woven into Vishnu\u2019s explorations on the Navtar, his self-designed nine-string instrument that merges fretted, fretless, and harp-like textures. Fresh from a US tour, this India and Southeast Asia debut carries music shaped by travel, trust, and attentive listening. \nGenres blur, and geographies dissolve, as music takes on a new form. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "A courtroom drama that shook an empire. \nIn 1945, three Indian National Army officers stood trial for treason against the British Crown. Shah Nawaz Khan, Prem Sahgal and Gurbaksh Dhillon were convicted. Then something unexpected happened; events that would accelerate the transfer of power and expose cracks in both British authority and Congress strategy. While Congress built its reputation on passive resistance, at this critical moment it applauded and capitalized on the INA\u2019s use of force. What does this contradiction reveal about the final phase of India\u2019s independence struggle? How did a legal proceeding meant to assert British control instead demonstrate its fragility? \nAshis Ray will discuss his latest book, The Trial that Shook Britain, which uncovers how this court martial became a catalyst for independence. Ray\u2019s research unearths material that historians have largely overlooked, throwing new light on a decisive juncture where courtroom drama became political dynamite. Following the talk, Ray will be in conversation with Siddharth Raja.  \nThe session concludes with a Q&A. \n",

    "description": "Once known as a garden city and a pensioner\u2019s paradise, Bengaluru has undergone extraordinary economic and demographic change over the past three decades. While growth has brought opportunity, it has also reshaped everyday life in ways that go far beyond traffic and waste.\u00a0This second edition of The Bengaluru Debates turns a critical lens on our city to ask whether it still supports healthy lives for its citizens. \nPublic health research increasingly shows that the roots of urban ill-health lie not only in hospitals or clinics, but in planning, infrastructure, and governance. Air quality, water and sanitation, food systems, mobility, housing design, open spaces, and access to light and ventilation all shape how healthy a city allows its people to be. Yet these questions rarely enter public debate in Bengaluru. \nOpening with a contextual presentation by Dr. Nachiket Mor, the session will move into a panel discussion between\u00a0Dinesh Gundu Rao, Hon\u2019ble Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Government of Karnataka; Dr. C N Ashwath Narayan, Former Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka and Member of the Legislative Assembly for Malleshwaram; Dr. Shreelata Rao Seshadri, Professor and Director, Ramalingaswami Centre for Equity and Social Determinants of Health, Public Health Foundation of India(PHFI). Moderated by Srikanth Viswanathan, CEO, Janaagraha, the panel will reflect on the relationship between the health of a city and the that of its citizens: what Bengaluru must rethink to secure a healthier future. \nThe discussion will be followed by an audience Q&A. \nThe Bengaluru Debates: A BIC\u2013Janaagraha Dialogue Series on Urban Governance in Bengaluru and Beyond\u00a0aims to expand civic space in the city by fostering conversations through a civic lens. The series is designed to be informative, constructive, and entertaining, while also serving as a trigger for local community action. Its objective is to bridge the gap between policy, practice, and public discourse on urban governance challenges, and to catalyse citizen and policymaker engagement towards systemic solutions. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nJanaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, founded in 2001 in Bengaluru, is dedicated to transforming the quality of life in India\u2019s cities and towns. Their mission is to strengthen the systems of urban governance so that cities can deliver clean, green, safe, and liveable environments for all citizens. For them, \u201cquality of life\u201d is not only about infrastructure and services, but equally about responsive institutions, citizen engagement, and transparent, data-driven governance. \n",

    "description": "What happens when the story parents tell themselves begins to unravel? \nThings I Know to Be True opens inside a household that appears settled, successful, and certain of its own choices. The parents believe they have raised four responsible, self-sufficient children. Yet, as the family gathers and life quietly intervenes, that confidence begins to fracture. Each child stands at a turning point (some comic, some devastating) forcing the family to confront what growing up truly costs, and what letting go really means. \nWritten by Australian playwright Andrew Bovell and directed by Delhi-based veteran theatre-maker Feisal Alkazi, the play traces the intimate tremors beneath everyday life: marriages that settle into routine, careers that falter, identities that refuse to stay hidden, and parents learning (often painfully) that love cannot protect against every fall. With deeply universal themes, the play has resonated across continents, becoming one of the world\u2019s most performed scripts in recent years. \nFamiliar lives, difficult choices, and the tender ache of watching those we love grow in unexpected ways. \n\nProduced in arrangement with Nick Hern Books \n\n\nSupported by: \n \n",

Together, they reflect on how narrative can sharpen our awareness of a planet in flux, and why attentiveness to history, to ecology, and to the unseen, matters now more than ever. \nA chance to hear directly from one of the most compelling literary voices about the inspirations behind his work and the urgent questions it raises.  \nPresented by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Raag Anuraag opens into an evening of khayal gayakee shaped by the quiet eloquence of the Rampur\u2013Sahaswan tradition. Known for its unhurried pace and lyrical clarity, this gharana values feeling over flourish, allowing melody to travel in long, graceful arcs. Each phrase is carefully placed, each turn of the raag revealed with patience, creating a sound world that is poised, reflective, and deeply attentive to nuance. \nHere, taan and tarana are not displays of speed but acts of expression. Taan\u00a0flows like extended sentences: supple, voice-led, and melodic. Tarana unfolds as song rather than spectacle, its syllables shaped for balance and resonance. The music lingers, listens, and slowly opens outward, inviting the raag to show its many shades. \nA contemplative experience of khayal from a unique tradition. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Sunil Mohan\u2019s memoir is a deeply reflective account of transition that moves beyond the familiar arc of before-and-after. Writing with honesty and quiet courage, Sunil traces a lifelong knowing of self alongside a persistent questioning of gender, masculinity, and belonging. \nAs he transitions from being read as female to male, the book resists easy definitions, asking how one might claim manhood without surrendering to narrow, socially sanctioned models of masculinity. Rather than centring pain alone, the narrative turns outward: to the queer, trans, anti-caste, feminist, and people\u2019s movements that have shaped Sunil\u2019s political and emotional world. It reflects on friendship, resistance, silence, healing, and the strength found in sharing our struggle. \nIn this conversation, Sunil Mohan will be joined by\u00a0contemporary inventive Dalit writer\u00a0Dr. Gogu Shyamala\u00a0and\u00a0Assistant Professor at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Reshma Bharadwaj\u00a0to reflect on the book\u2019s themes, the politics of becoming, and the quiet pride of living with integrity. Urvashi Butalia, founder of Zubaan books will throw light on feminist publishing around queer histories and narratives. \nThis book emerged as part of a research study on \u2018De-Constructing Masculinities,\u2019\u00a0 by maraa, a media and arts collective, supported by Edelgive Foundation. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Can corruption be designed out of human behaviour? \nCorruption is widely acknowledged as a brake on growth, trust, and institutional legitimacy, yet efforts to eliminate it have repeatedly fallen short. This lecture revisits the idea of corruption not just as a moral failure, but as a behavioural and systemic challenge, one shaped by incentives, norms, and the structures within which people operate. \nDrawing on international experience, advances in technology, and evolving research on human behaviour, the session examines why many anti-corruption strategies falter, and how poorly designed policies can sometimes deepen the very problems they aim to solve. Rather than offering easy solutions, the lecture invites a more careful reckoning with what we know about changing behaviour at scale, and whether corruption can ever be fully eradicated, or only meaningfully constrained. \nThis lecture is a part of Vidyashilp University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Hidden within Gujarat\u2019s landscape is the living memory of the malunga: a sacred musical bow of the African-Indian Sidi community, whose sound carries histories of migration, faith, and resilience. This event opens a rare window into a niche cultural world in India, where music is not performance alone, but inheritance. Through documentary and dialogue, it introduces the Sidis as Sufi Muslims of the Rifa\u2019i tariqa, rooted in the spiritual lineage of Bava Gor, the fourteenth-century saint from Nubia who journey and settled in India. \nThe evening begins with a screening of The Sidi Malunga Project: Rejuvenating the African Musical Bow in India (2002), by Amy Catlin-Jairazbhoy and Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy: a\u00a0film that documents not only the malunga\u2019s near-disappearance, but also captures the\u00a0extraordinary moment of revival\u00a0that brought elders and youth together to ensure its survival. The screening is followed by a presentation of the newly formed Sidi Culture and Heritage Trust, outlining ongoing efforts to sustain Sidi musical, spiritual, and cultural life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rare window into a living, resilient culture: a musical world few know, but many will remember. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "A jugalbandi for the new age! \nThis Hindustani concert brings together three musicians whose journeys converge at the frontier that is Indo-jazz. Saxophonist Phill Scarff, long associated with cross-cultural explorations, meets Bengaluru-based slide guitarist Dr. Prakash Sontakke, whose fluid phrasing draws from Hindustani grammar while remaining open to contemporary sound worlds. Tabla maestro Gurumurthy Vaidya completes the trio, grounding the dialogue with rhythmic depth and supple responsiveness. \nWhat unfolds is a conversation through improvisation. The saxophone\u2019s burnished tone, the gliding resonance of the slide guitar, and the intricate play of taal move between structure and freedom, tradition and risk. Rooted in classical sensibility yet shaped by jazz\u2019s openness, the music charts a shared space where genres blur, listening deepens, and new possibilities quietly emerge. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Curiosity might have killed the cat, but it is the life of every scientific revolution. \nThis lecture celebrates the radical power of curiosity through the life and work of Michael Faraday, whose devotion to understanding nature for its own sake transformed how we see the physical world. Faraday\u2019s experiments with electricity and magnetism did more than solve isolated puzzles; they reshaped reality itself, laying the foundations for technologies that now define modern life. \nIn this talk, Arthur Eisenkraft traces the evolution of physics from early questions about electrostatics to the breakthroughs of \u00d8rsted, Faraday, and Maxwell, culminating in the birth of field theory. Along the way, he reflects on why curiosity-driven research (often dismissed as abstract or impractical) remains essential to innovation. \nAn invitation to rediscover wonder in scientific inquiry, this lecture speaks to anyone interested in how asking the right questions can change the world. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

One continuous string of sound. \nThis lecture\u2013demonstration traces the surprising history of the Rudra Veena, Surbahar, and Sitar: three string instruments that shaped the imagination of Indian classical music across centuries. Moving from the deep, contemplative resonance of early traditions to the expressive possibilities of modern forms, the session reveals how design, repertoire, and aesthetics evolved alongside changing musical worlds. \nGuiding this journey is Dr. Jayant Kumar Das, among the very few artists in India proficient in all three instruments, and an A-graded All India Radio artiste on each. Through carefully chosen demonstrations and reflective conversation, he evokes the musical philosophies surrounding these strings, from the gravity of Dhrupad to the subtle refinements of Khayal. Joining him are Abhijit Sarkar on pakhawaj, Mihir Kallianpur on tabla, Sashikala Bhat on vocals, and C. Shivashankar on tanpura. \nA listening space where history speaks through sound, and tradition reveals itself anew. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "This edition of My Guru, My Art offers a distinctive lens on legacy. While the life and work of Vidushi Lalith J Rao are traced through the voices and performances of her students, a personal perspective is brought in by her husband, Shri N. Jayavanth Rao, who will be present on her behalf. The performances will be accompanied by Surya Upadhya on the harmonium and Yogeesh Bhat on the tabla. Through a careful weaving of conversation and live music, the programme reflects on Vidhushi Lalithji\u2019s journey from early training in Bengaluru to her stature as a leading torchbearer of the Agra\u2013Atrauli Gharana, and on the values she shaped and passed on. Curated and scripted by Manohar Patwardhan and Tara Kini, the evening is both a tribute and a heartfelt celebration of a luminous journey. \nThe Guru-Shishya parampara has been integral to the learning of Indian classical dance and music art forms: a deeply immersive and rigorous tradition that holds its own even in the modern context. A profound emotional and spiritual bond forms between teacher and student, through which not just the practice and knowledge of art, but also a way of life is transmitted down the generations. The Guru goes beyond the imparting of technicalities and nuances of art to shape and hone the Shishya\u2019s voice, indeed, the artistic identity. The Shishya, part of a lineage that connects to the Guru\u2019s Gurus, links the past with the future, carrying this tradition to a new generation of artistes and audiences. \nThis series, My Guru, My Art\u00a0 takes an intimate look at this tradition and hopes to capture for posterity the stories of how the magic is created. In these sessions artistes explore personal histories of learning a classical art form, sharing memories of interactions with their teachers, inspirations, influences, anecdotes of compositions and teaching moments, punctuated by music to illustrate the stories. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Can a dancer hold rhythm in her feet, melody in her voice, and an instrument in her hands? \nThis performance brings Indian classical dance, music, and rhythm into conversation. Rooted in Kathak and reaching across vocals, sitar and tabla, the production traces how movement, melody, and taal speak to one another: not as separate disciplines, but rather, as interwoven modes of expression. \nThe performance features a rare Kathak Yoga segment, where the dancer sings the rhythmic cycle, plays an instrument, and dances complex mathematical patterns simultaneously. It also ventures into a 5\u00bd-beat cycle, an unusual rhythmic inquiry, followed by an unconventional jugalbandi that draws the entire musical ensemble into spontaneous dialogue with the dance.\u00a0 \nThe evening unfolds a porous performance space where roles blur and expression travels freely between body, voice, and rhythm.\u00a0 \nSupported by:\n \n\u00a0 \n",
