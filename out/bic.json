    "description": "Thanuja: A Memoir of Migration and Transition is the first memoir by a Sri Lankan Tamil transwoman who is now a German citizen. The recently published English translation has been gaining attention across social media for its powerful account of gender, displacement, and resilience across continents. \nThis session reflects on the layered process of translating Thanuja Singam\u2019s life story, not only across languages but also across histories, geographies, and identity formations. In placing the memoir in dialogue with the expanding field of Indian trans literature, the discussion opens up questions around how language shapes identity, how trans voices find space on the page, and how literary traditions both support and constrain such narratives. \nThe conversation will engage with the evolving landscape of trans writing in South Asia, examining the literary, political, and affective threads that connect diverse trans experiences. It also considers how translation can serve as a bridge between communities, turning individual testimony into collective memory. \n",

Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recounts the crucial history of how welfare has evolved in India over the past century. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks important questions, illuminates failures and brings clarity to our murky future. \nAuthor Louise Tillin in conversation with Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan, moderated by Arun Thiruvengadam, will explore what India\u2019s welfare journey means for citizens, workers, and voters today. \nCurious about where your taxes go, or why support doesn\u2019t always reach those who need it most? Stay for the Q&A and bring your questions. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "45 minutes |\u00a0English, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi with English subtitles | 2004 \nAs part of BIC\u2019s Pride Programs, this session will include a screening of T Jayashree\u2019s Many People, Many Desires, followed by a panel discussion with T Jayashree, Mira Brunner and Siddharth Narrain. \nMany People, Many Desires is centered around the interviews of many members of the LGBTQ community in Bangalore at the time. The film was shot entirely in a MiniDV tape format. Starting from an exploration of sexuality and human rights, it allows the viewer to hear the first-person narratives of some of those who were engaged with the sexuality movement of the time \u2013 whose work is instrumental for the fight for legal rights for queer people in India. \nUsing legal discrimination against sexual minorities as its starting point, the film explores the relationship between class, sexuality, and gender. The film captures early years in the movement against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial law which criminalized homosexual behavior and has now, through efforts which included some of those interviewed in the film, been read down. \nThe panel will talk about what has changed, what has remained the same, and QAMRA\u2019s (the Queer Archive of Memory, Reflection, and Activism) attempts to preserve this history. They will discuss their perspectives on archiving queer material and the responsibilities of preserving what is still in living memory. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis year, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is \u2014 unconforming, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression.

    "description": "This two-piece contemporary dance performance explores the body\u2019s inner battles and breakthroughs. While one piece unravels self-doubt; the other captures the pulse of transformation. \nMetamorphosis \nThe dancers explore the reactions of what happens when one goes through the process of transformation. How does one\u2019s body\u2019s senses and feelings react through this unending loop between creation of new patterns, destruction, and recreation of one another. Metamorphosis dives deep into the question of how a pattern impacts the body? And during the period of transition when old patterns are fading away and the new self is finding its expression in the world, what is then your relationship to the changed self, and how does your body respond to this change? What is this new self? Is it an add-on to the old pattern or a breakaway into something new? \nLost in Oscillation \nThis piece carries us into the surreal world of self-doubt; shifting, strange, and deeply personal. The dancer moves through a dreamlike space, where self-doubt becomes a physical presence that twists the body and unsettles the mind. Reflections fragment across the stage, echoing the dancer\u2019s inner conflict. Movements swing between sharp tension and quiet stillness, capturing the push and pull of uncertainty. With haunting sound and abstract visuals, the piece invites you into a world where even your own reflection feels unfamiliar. It\u2019s not just a performance\u2014it\u2019s a glimpse into the shifting terrain of the self. \nThe peformance will be followed by a short interaction with the audience. \nSupported by: \n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "What happens when the promise of equal citizenship begins to fade for one of the world\u2019s largest Muslim populations? In today\u2019s India, the question is no longer theoretical, but urgent and deeply personal for over 200 million people. \nThis session explores the shifting political landscape of Indian Muslims through the lens of Shikwa-e-Hind, the new book by political scientist Mujibur Rehman. He examines what he calls their \u201cthird political moment,\u201d a phase marked by the erosion of constitutional equality and the rise of a majoritarian ethos since 2014. Tracing the arc from the aftermath of 1857, through the hopeful vision of 1947, to today\u2019s polarised climate, Rehman invites a critical look at the future of democratic participation for Indian Muslims. \nThe conversation features Mujibur Rehman in dialogue with author and columnist Aakar Patel and moderated by journalist Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed. They will explore the tension between constitutional ideals and majoritarian pressures, the structural challenges of representation, and the possibilities for reclaiming dignity, rights, and democratic participation for Indian Muslims. The session will conclude with a Q&A, offering space for your questions in what promises to be an inclusive and engaging discussion. \n",
