    "description": "\nThe session builds on Asko Parpola & Iravatham Mahadevan\u2019s extensive works to show that a substantial portion of the IVC seals was a Celestial Omens List with the planet Venus occupying a central role in their astronomy. The study presents the full decipherment of 75 inscriptions and a partial decipherment of 61 inscriptions forming approximately 5% of the total number of inscriptions. \n\n\n\nKey findings demonstrate the exceptional astronomical sophistication of the Harappan civilization, including: (1) proof that bilingual parallels can effectively decipher the IVC script; (2) evidence that Harappan astronomical knowledge predated Babylonian astronomy by centuries; (3) the first complete decipherment of the Swastika symbol, revealing its astronomical significance; (4) identification of signs for planetary movements, conjunctions, and their associated omens; (5) discovery of Harappan meteorological methods using Venusian astronomy; and (6) a new understanding of the Great Bath Complex as a venue for astronomical rituals. \n\n\nThis work represents a significant breakthrough in understanding the intellectual and religious life of one of the world\u2019s earliest urban civilizations, revealing their deep engagement with astronomical observation and its application to social and religious practices. Through archaeoastronomical analysis, the paper reconstructs the probable actual dates of celestial events tracked by the Harappans, providing empirical validation for the proposed decipherments.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience.\n\n",

    "description": "Equus derived from the Latin word for \u2018Horse\u2019 is a psychological drama that delves deep into the mind\u2019s primal corners. Written in 1973, the English \u201cwhydunit\u201d, inspired by a real-life incident, unravels the mystery behind a shocking act of violence; \u201cSeventeen-year-old, Alan Strang, blinds four horses with a metal spike, in a single night\u201d. \nThe story follows Martin Dysart, a child psychiatrist, who begins treating Alan, only to find himself grappling with his inner turmoil. As the investigation unfolds, Dysart brings to light, Alan\u2019s religious, emotional, and sexual obsession for horses, which leads him to confront unsettling truths about the nature of normalcy, worship, and desire. Consumed by envy of Alan\u2019s raw, unfiltered passion, he is forced to confront the suffocating monotony of his own life. \nPlayhouse re-imagines the classic through Jung\u2019s lens of \u2018Shadow Self\u2019, and makes use of the evocative power of shadow theatre to throw light on the darkness that remains hidden. Alan\u2019s intense passion and obsession with horses becomes a powerful metaphor for humanity\u2019s most profound extremes\u2014what we suppress, what we idolize, and what ultimately defines our very existence. \nCrafted by Peter Shaffer \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Bag Dancing, written by Mike Kenny, one of England\u2019s foremost playwrights for young audiences, is directed by Ujwala Rao and produced by Butai. The cast features acclaimed Kannada and English theatre artists B V Shrunga and Surabhi J Herur. \nThe play poignantly follows Imelda, a homeless woman who carries her life\u2019s memories and stories in bags. Neville, a young worker at a homeless shelter, guards his emotions, burdened by his own past. As their unexpected friendship blossoms, they begin to share their stories, creating a meaningful bond between them. \nDirector\u2019s Note: \nBag Dancing is a play that has drawn me in repeatedly. What continues to captivate me is how playwright Mike Kenny thoughtfully and playfully explores powerful themes such as war, displacement, and the intersection of mental health and authority\u2014particularly through a lens that resonates with children and young audiences. \nDuring the creative process, I\u2019ve found the exploration of boxes and borders especially intriguing\u2014who defines them, who decides their importance, and how we navigate the spaces they limit. \nThis play presents a unique opportunity for families and schools to engage in meaningful conversations with children, sparking discussions about complex topics that might otherwise seem too difficult or uncomfortable to address. \nI hope Bag Dancing fosters reflection, curiosity, and open dialogue. \nCredits: \nProduction Assistant: Rachana R\nChoreography: Asha Basavaraj \nSupported by: \n \n",

We then journey with Meerabai, who seeks her beloved Krishna through soulful bhajans marked by longing, devotion, and unanswered questions. Devaki\u2019s poignant voice follows, reflecting on the joys of motherhood she never fully experienced and her yearning to reclaim lost moments with her son, Krishna. The production concludes with Akka Mahadevi, whose powerful Vachanas guide us on a quest for liberation, echoing the eternal human desire for union and truth. \nEach piece is supported by evocative compositions, guided by literary scholars, and brought to life through thoughtful choreography. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "In this refreshingly jargon-free session, Lavanya Mohan, author of\u00a0Money Doesn\u2019t Grow on Trees,\u00a0gets real about why personal finance often feels confusing, boring, or just plain overwhelming. \nFrom spending in your 20s to planning in your 40s, Lavanya\u2019s approach is simple, meme-filled, and judgment-free. Whether you\u2019re dealing with your first paycheck, lifestyle creep, or just trying to adult responsibly, this conversation covers how to spend smarter at every life stage\u2014without spreadsheets or guilt. \nLavanya will be in conversation with Dipika Jaikishan, Co-Founder and COO of Basis, a platform focused on financial independence for women. Together, with their understanding of how financial literacy intersects with everyday life, especially for younger and often overwhelmed audiences, Lavanya and Dipika bring both insight and clarity to a conversation that promises to be as useful as it is fun. \nExpect memes, pop culture references, stories from the book, and zero jargon. Just real talk about money\u2014how we use it, why we fear it, and how to make it work for us. \n",
