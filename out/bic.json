    "description": "Mahua, the flower of the forest, carries with it memory, resilience, and taste. Once central to community life, it is now being reclaimed as a symbol of pride, livelihood, and ecological care. \nWe begin with a screening of Mahua \u2013 Wild Dreams, Wild Harvest, a short documentary by Ganesh Tilgam and Priyanshu Raj (Green Hub Fellows). The film traces how ethical harvesting and community-led initiatives are bringing Mahua back into the heart of culture and economy. \nA panel discussion, Reviving Mahua: From Forest to Future, follows. Ecologists, writers, entrepreneurs, chefs, and community members open a many-sided conversation on Mahua\u2019s cultural, ecological, and culinary significance. \nThe evening closes with a Mahua Tasting, where the flower\u2019s delicate sweetness and earthy depth come alive in both savoury and sweet forms. Crafted in collaboration with chefs and food researchers, this tasting invites you to meet Mahua not just as a plant, but as an experience of flavour, memory, and possibility. \nA flower, a flavour, a memory: take Mahua with you in more ways than one. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "Between Gandhi and Savarkar lies the story of India\u2019s unresolved future. \nThe future of India has long been caught between two irreconcilable visions. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar were not just men, but embodiments of two enduring ideologies: Hind Swaraj and Hindutva. Their contest was never merely personal; it was a struggle over what India could, and should, become. \nPartition was one gash on the body of the nation, its scars still visible. Can India afford new wounds? To even attempt an answer, we must return to the old antagonisms \u2013 between communities, yes, but also within Hindu society itself. Few rivalries have been as sharp, or as consequential, as that between Gandhi and Savarkar. \nBased on his new book, Hindutva and Hind Swaraj, this talk reflects on the unresolved gulf between Gandhi and Savarkar. Not as history, but as a question that remains open: can such differences ever be bridged, or are they the fault lines of India\u2019s future? \n",

    "description": "Before the spotlights, who kept the women\u2019s game alive? \nIn 2017, India\u2019s women cricketers came heartbreakingly close to a World Cup win at Lord\u2019s. That match lit a fire, changing how the country saw its women athletes, and laying the foundation for today\u2019s Women\u2019s Premier League \u2013 the first women\u2019s sports league to turn profitable even before a single ball was bowled. \nIt\u2019s the first time since that iconic evening at Lord\u2019s that the Women\u2019s World Cup is set to be hosted in India. \nThis session will celebrate those forgotten days when world cups in India were played in front of empty seats, even when the cricket itself was no less significant. Bringing these narratives to life are Karunya Keshav, Ananya Upendran, and Aayush Puthran. This is a chance to hear directly from some of the best storytellers on women\u2019s cricket. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nBookmark is a dating app for readers, created by the founders of Cubbon Reads, where one swipes books, not looks.

    "description": "How do centuries-old verses find new life in rhythm and movement? \nKABIR is a Bharatanatyam production that brings the timeless poetry of Sant Kabir into conversation with dance. What makes this work unique is the seamless weaving of Kabir\u2019s Hindi verses into the expressive framework of Bharatanatyam, guided by the musical brilliance of Vidwan O. S. Arun. His evocative vocals create a living bridge between word and movement, allowing the spiritual depth of Kabir\u2019s poetry to bloom on stage. \nConceived and choreographed by Varsha Akhouri, alumna and former faculty of the Kalakshetra Foundation, the production embodies both tradition and innovation. With her students carrying forward the performance, the piece becomes not just a retelling of Kabir\u2019s verses but a passing on of artistic legacy. \nKabir\u2019s words question dogma, transcend boundaries, and call us to simplicity, love, and self-realisation. In this production, poetry and dance converge to reveal their continued resonance with our fragmented world. \nA performance for the divine within and without. \nCredits:\nMusic and Vocals:\u00a0O S Arun\nConcept and Choreography:\u00a0Varsha Akhouri\nTabla: Martin\nMridangam: Shivaprasad\nSitar: Kishore\nFlute: Hariprasad\nSound engineer: Rakesh\nJathi: Sheejith Krishna\nLights: Venkatesh Krishna \nDancers:\nAsika Sajeevan\nAarathi S Nair\nDevika AC\nJisma K.K\nRoopesh PP\nShobhit Shivhare\nSreelakshmi EB\nSreeshna KM\nSreerejini NS \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "India\u2019s first and only Master of Wine, Sonal C Holland, sits down with Harish Vasudev, Director at Museum of Art and Photography, to talk about her memoir One In A Billion and the remarkable journey which inspired her to write it. \nThis dialogue traces how Sonal walked away from a thriving corporate career and dared to pursue a career in wine even before India knew how to drink it. From knowing nothing about wine, she embarked on a gruelling decade-long pursuit of the world\u2019s most respected wine qualification. It will also explore her rise as one of the most trusted and popular voices in the alcobev space, emphasising the importance of self-investment, ambition without a blueprint, and chasing success without shortcuts. \nIn this candid conversation, Sonal will reveal what it takes to build a market from scratch and to lead with vision when no roadmap exists. Drawing from years of entrepreneurship, leadership, and global experience, she will offer a rare perspective on creating impact and shaping an industry against the odds. A Q&A session with the audience will follow the fireside chat. \nPresented by:\n \n",

    "description": "At its heart, The Dark Hours of the Night is a story about girlhood under constraint, about how adolescence, desire, and freedom are shaped and stifled within the walls of a conservative household. \nRabia\u2019s journey, woven together with the lives of her friends and cousins, illuminates the subtle negotiations, unspoken rebellions, and fragile solidarities that mark women\u2019s coming-of-age in a patriarchal world. The novel opens a conversation about the everyday intimacies of restriction and resistance: the ache of thwarted desire, the bonds of friendship, the weight of silence, and the difficult balance between compromise and courage. It asks what it means to grow up when the future has already been decided, and whether education, love, or even small acts of defiance can shift those boundaries. \nIn this session, Subodh Sankar and Salma will reflect on these resonant themes, of gender, family, power, and the search for selfhood, that lie at the centre of The Dark Hours of the Night and across Salma\u2019s larger body of work.

    "description": "What does it take to dream beyond your time\u2014and make those dreams real? \nVikram Sarabhai, founder of India\u2019s space programme, imagined communication satellites that would educate people when even a modest rocket launch seemed audacious. He envisioned agricultural complexes powered by atomic energy, sea water turned drinkable, and a modern India fuelled by science and creativity. But Sarabhai was more than a scientist\u2014he co-founded the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, the National Institute of Design, the dance academy Darpana, and India\u2019s first textile research cooperative, ATIRA. He also ran a thriving pharmaceutical company and launched India\u2019s first market research organisation, ORG. \nAs India navigates its twenty-first century aspirations, this session revisits the humane, imaginative, yet pragmatic vision of a man who built enduring institutions. Drawing from Vikram Sarabhai: A Life, author Amrita Shah offers an intimate portrait of a multifaceted genius whose legacy continues to shape India\u2019s present and future. She will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey, exploring the many lives and lasting vision of this extraordinary builder of modern India. \nThe conversation will conclude with an audience Q&A. \n",

    "description": "What happens when institutions bend, freedoms collapse, and silence rules? India once knew. \nFive decades may have passed, but the Emergency remains a stark reminder of how swiftly freedoms can be curtailed. In those 21 months, prisons filled, the press was silenced, and democratic institutions bent under the weight of authoritarian rule. The questions it leaves behind are urgent: what does this episode tell us about the fragility of democracy, and what echoes of it persist today? \nA new volume gathers reflections from scholars, writers, historians, journalists, and activists to probe this turbulent chapter and its continuing relevance. Joining the discussion are Peter Ronald de Souza, co-editor of the book, historian Janaki Nair, sociologist Chandan Gowda, and political scientist Rinku Lamba, in a conversation moderated by Thomas Abraham.\u00a0 \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Can dance translate the restlessness of a conscience, the weight of compassion? \nWith Gandhi, choreographer C P Satyajit reimagines the Mahatma\u2019s life and philosophy through the timeless language of Bharatanatyam. This is not a chronological retelling, but a meditation on his ideals: his restless pursuit of truth, his unwavering sense of justice, his profound connection with people. \nThrough delicate abhinaya and layered rhythmic improvisations, the production traces Gandhi\u2019s journey as both a leader and a seeker. Informed by the research of Dr. V R Devika, whose PhD explored Gandhi\u2019s communication strategies, the work captures how his ideals might continue to move us, literally and metaphorically, today.\n\nIn this unique performance, every gesture is a reminder that truth and compassion remain unfinished tasks. \nCredits:\nConcept & Choreography:\u00a0C P Satyajit \nDancers:\nKeerthana Ganesan\nDevikha S\nHemavathy Kalaiarasan\nParvathi Parameswar\nArchana Sivasubramanian\nAnjannaa Ashok \nMusicians\nM S Sukhi: Rhythm\nMonali Bala: Voice\nManonmani T: Sarangi \nOriginal Lighting Design: Martin Jose\nOperated by: Muthukumar R \nThe production is created by Bharata Kalanjali with the support of the Kaladham Trust and Sarvodaya International, Karnataka. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n\u00a0 \nSupported by:\n \n",

In a quiet Swiss town, loved ones gather from across the world to raise a last toast, while a filmmaker friend documents the delicate passage between celebration and farewell. What unfolds is a tender meditation on choice, companionship, and the courage to define one\u2019s own ending. \nLayered with memory and emotion, the film draws viewers into a journey where the everyday collides with the profound, and where the act of bearing witness becomes as significant as the story itself. \nAfter the screening, directors Nilesh Maniyar and\u00a0Shonali Bose will be present for an in-person discussion with Sandhya Kumar, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \nCheck out the trailer here \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "The ancient Indian Panchanga, or Hindu calendar, is a remarkable synthesis of astronomy, mathematics, and cultural tradition. This unique event brings it alive using modern Stellarium astronomy software, where celestial movements will be visualised through simple planetary animations. \nParticipants will learn the meaning of terms like\u00a0Masa, Paksha, Tithi, and Nakshatra, and discover why our festivals shift dates each year, why months have 30 or 31 days, why there are 12 zodiac signs, and why exactly 27 nakshatras govern the skies. These everyday questions find their answers in the ingenious design of the Panchanga. \nThe session also highlights the rich heritage of the Hindu school of astronomy. Flourishing for over 1,500 years and reaching a peak during the Vijayanagar period, with Kerala as its vibrant epicenter, this tradition produced profound insights into planetary motion and time. The ancient text\u00a0Surya Siddhanta\u00a0went even further, defining multiple scales of time\u2014from a human day (sunrise to sunrise), to a day of the Pitrs (a lunar month), to a day of the gods (a solar year). It even stretched the imagination to the grand cosmic cycles of\u00a0parardha\u2014155.52 trillion years\u2014down to the fleeting span of\u00a0prana, a few seconds. \nBy blending science with storytelling, speaker\u00a0S. Kishore Kumar\u00a0will reveal how the Hindu calendar is not just a tool for marking festivals, but a timeless scientific framework that connects human life to the rhythms of the cosmos. \nIn collaboration with:\n   \n",

These exquisite paintings reveal an enduring ensemble of percussion, wind and string instruments, and performers of all genders and creeds making music for specific occasions. \nStep closer to an age where melody was power, poetry, and prayer all at once. \nPresented by: \n \n",
