    "description": "Indian paper money has a rich history, filled with numerous fascinating stories and unique aspects that reflect the country\u2019s diverse heritage and evolving economy. \nOne of the most remarkable pieces is the only surviving ancient paper note of India, which was circulated during the British colonial period. Equally significant is the first One Rupee note issued in 1917, marking the early stages of formal paper currency in the country. Among the rare denominations is the unusual Two and a Half Rupees note, which stands out for its distinct value and limited circulation. \nThe influence of foreign colonial powers is also evident in the paper money issued by the Portuguese and French in their respective territories in India. Additionally, several princely states across the subcontinent issued their own forms of paper currency, showcasing the regional autonomy and diversity of pre-independence India. \nOther intriguing aspects include the issuance of Prisoners of War Camp Money and the use of paper cash coupons as a substitute for currency in certain regions. A rare and noteworthy event in monetary history is the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s simultaneous issuance of currency notes for two different countries\u2014an occurrence seldom seen elsewhere. \nIndia has also seen the release of commemorative banknotes on a single known occasion, adding a unique dimension to its numismatic record. More recently, the 2016 demonetisation marked a historic turning point, acting as a catalyst for increased digital economy awareness and financial literacy across the nation. \nIn this session, Mr. Rezwan Razack dives into some fascinating anecdotes of Indian paper money. He\u2019ll also be in conversation with Ramjee Chandran about the evolving nature of currency in India. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Dr. B. R. Ambedkar is remembered and admired for many things: for his heroic, lifelong, campaign to eradicate the evil of untouchability; for his scholarly contributions as an economist and social theorist; for the social movements he led and the political parties he founded; for the educational institutions he nurtured; for his critical role in overseeing and directing the framing of the Constitution; for the brilliant books, essays and pamphlets that he authored on a variety of subjects. \nThis lecture will focus on Ambedkar as a visionary and deeply insightful theorist of constitutional democracy. By juxtaposing what he said in his speeches in the Constituent Assembly to the social and political realities of contemporary India, I shall demonstrate how his ideas remain of compelling relevance to us today. While the core of the talk will be on Ambedkar the political theorist, it will end by briefly comparing his legacy with that of other remarkable Indians of his generation, such as Nehru, Gandhi, Tagore, and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay. \nThe National Law School of India University, Bengaluru (NLSIU) and the Ahmadi Foundation have entered into a MoU to set up the Justice Ahmadi Initiative on Rule of Law, Democracy, and Social Justice in honour of, and to preserve and promote the legacy of former Chief Justice of India, Justice Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi. The Initiative will work to advance the ideas that Justice Ahmadi championed throughout his distinguished career, including but not restricted to human rights, education, inclusion and protection of vulnerable communities, judicial independence, alternate dispute resolution mechanisms, and strengthening of democratic institutions. An annual distinguished lecture series is one of the events planned under the Initiative. Read more about it here. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "The Chittara art form practised by the Deevaru Community is engaged primarily by the women folk of the community as a socio-cultural practice. Nestled in the ranges of verdant western ghats of North Canara live the Deevaru people, a matriarchal-agrarian community of nature-worshippers, residing in and around Sagara, Karnataka. Chittara art has become an integral part of their daily routines. It was never a profession, but a practice that has artistic and socio-cultural value. For women of the Deevaru community Chittara paintings are a source of great joy, beauty and creativity. For painting, women artists use eco-friendly natural resources like ground rice paste for white, charred rice for black, powdered Gurige seeds for yellow, and soil/earth for red. \nIn this workshop, you will learn to draw a few motifs of Chittara along with their description. You can then draw these on a small cane tray to take home to. You will also get to know how natural paints are used in this art along with the eco-friendly handicrafts they make. \nWhat will you take home?\nKnowing the socio-cultural aspects of the community\nLearn a folk art form of Karnataka\nCompleted piece of artwork done by yourself \nWhat do you need to bring?\nWater bottle to keep you hydrated.\nKindly get a note book/notepad, a pencil, an eraser and a rag cloth.\nNote: Other essential materials will be provided by the host. \nCenter for Revival of Indigenous Art (CFRIA), founded by Ms Geetha Bhat, is a non-profit organisation working to preserve and promote Chittara folk art, Karnataka. CFRIA has showcased events, Lec-dems, workshops at various educational, cultural institutions, and exhibitions. Chittara murals can be witnessed at Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA) Indian Music Experience (IME) Bosch, Taneira showrooms to name a few. CFRIA is now working on the Chittara folk art Archival book, which aims to address the dearth of resources on Chittara, essential for its preservation.

    "description": "The Western Ghats enjoyed a central place in the life and science of cytogeneticist E. K. Janaki Ammal (1897-1984). To her, the dense and tall tropical evergreen forests found here was the epitome of climax vegetation in India, or the mature stage of ecological succession. In order to understand how this balance was reached and stability attained, she undertook a grand and pioneering project\u2014 a study of the relationship between peoples and plants of the region, both in deep history and the immediate present. One of her chief aims was the making of a modern and decolonialised version of the Hortus Malabaricus\u2014 a new compendium of medicinal plants from the Western Ghats, reordered on the basis of chromosomes, and containing information on their uses, as gathered from the forest dwellers, who she believed were the primary interlocutors of indigenous medico-botanical knowledge. Also, quite tellingly, in her advancing years, rather than expend energy directly wrestling with the Kerala government on the Silent Valley issue, she championed for its conservation by mobilising international support and creatively embarked on an innovative project\u2014 the cytogenetics of the flora of these undisturbed forests. \nThis lecture is part of the\u00a0Obaid Siddiqi Lectures,\u00a0Annual lectures delivered by the Obaid Siddiqi Chair in the History and Culture of Science at the Archives at NCBS. \nImage credit: Thumbnail and Header Art by Megha Ramachandra \nIn collaboration with \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

Through two distinct dance forms, Kuchipudi and Balinese, the dynamic balance of opposing energies is beautifully displayed. \nCentred around \u2018Ardhanareeswara\u2019, the composite form of Shiva-Shakti, the dance visualises the distinct yet complementary nature of the masculine and feminine energies.

    "description": "Ehsaas is a meditative, multi-sensory experience that invites audiences to step into a world shaped by sound, memory, and emotion. This quiet, immersive performance centers around\u00a0narrative fragments, ambient audio, and subtle sensory cues that evoke personal and collective histories. \nPresented in an intimate, contemplative setting, Ehsaas is not theatre in the conventional sense \u2014 it is a space for listening, sensing, and remembering. Stories unfold through voice, texture, and sonic layering rather than action or spectacle. The work leans into silence as much as it does into sound, creating room for individual interpretation and emotional resonance. \nRooted in lived experience and artistic experimentation, Ehsaas invites the audience to witness \u2014 and be witnessed \u2014 through the intangible yet deeply felt realms of inner life. It offers a rare pause, a shared breath, and a gentle return to feeling. \nIn collaboration with:\n \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "The solitude of the night-time has always been a space where humans release their innermost thoughts, whether of comfort, terror, liberation, wistfulness or hope. As such, many of the finest works of art have been inspired by its thrall. Karl Lutchmayer\u2019s recital discusses and presents some powerful emotional responses to the darkness by a quintet of composer-pianists who represent a pantheon of Romantic and Modernist ethea. From yearning lullabies, intimate reminiscences, and nocturnal soundscapes to religious ecstasy, and gothic horror, each showcases the extraordinary resources of the piano and the technical and emotional range of the pianist\u2019s art. \n \n\u00a0 \nImage Credit: \nThumbnail, Header and Poster: Photos of Karl Lutchmayer by Param Singh \n\u00a0 \nPresented by the International Music and Arts Society \n \n\u00a0 \nWith the support of Furtados and Steinway \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\u00a0 \nThe International Music and Arts Society gratefully acknowledges the support of Shashi Uthappa and V Natarajan. \n",
