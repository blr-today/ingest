    "description": "This conversation will shift your understanding of power, and of possibility. \nIn this session Rahila Gupta will examine how male dominance persists across radically different societies from theocracies to democracies, dictatorships to socialist states. Her co-authored book Planet Patriarchy asks what makes patriarchy so resilient, and where feminism is not just surviving but genuinely thriving. \nAt the heart of the conversation is a revelation: a little-known women\u2019s revolution in Rojava, Northeast Syria. Here, women are building a bottom-up democracy rooted in multi-ethnic inclusivity and ecological sustainability. It\u2019s a radical reimagining of power that challenges everything we think we know about governance and gender. \nConcluding with an audience Q&A, this session invites you to rethink power, resilience, and the possibilities of feminist futures, one where gender equality isn\u2019t an afterthought but the foundation. \n",

    "description": "A society fails not when it lacks talent, but when talent has nowhere to go. \nIn this lecture, Professor Anirudh Krishna invites us to reimagine opportunity not as luck or merit, but as something societies deliberately construct. Drawing on over a decade of global research across countries and contexts, this lecture asks an uncomfortable question: how much potential are we wasting when millions operate far below what they\u2019re truly capable of? \nThrough stories of nations that have successfully built strong pathways to success, we\u2019ll explore the architecture of progress: the schools, networks, policies, and cultural shifts that turn capacity into achievement. This isn\u2019t your average abstract policy talk but rather a conversation to understand the structures that launch young people toward their dreams or leave them stranded. \nWhether you\u2019re an educator, policymaker, parent, or simply someone who cares about untapped potential, this conversation will reshape how you think about development and the futures we\u2019re building together! \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

First published by Tulika Books in 2005 and now in its seventh reprint, the book has become a steady favourite among parents, reviewers and young readers alike. Celebrated for its warm narrative of kindness and friendship, as well as illustrations that make every page feel like artwork, it continues to be recommended as a standout picture book two decades after its debut. \nJoin us for a joyful session that revisits a story whose sparks of wonder and empathy glow brightly long after it is read. \nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins, not with a ticket, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "What happens when the story parents tell themselves begins to unravel? \nThings I Know to Be True opens inside a household that appears settled, successful, and certain of its own choices. The parents believe they have raised four responsible, self-sufficient children. Yet, as the family gathers and life quietly intervenes, that confidence begins to fracture. Each child stands at a turning point (some comic, some devastating) forcing the family to confront what growing up truly costs, and what letting go really means. \nWritten by Australian playwright Andrew Bovell and directed by veteran theatre-maker Feisal Alkazi, the play traces the intimate tremors beneath everyday life: marriages that settle into routine, careers that falter, identities that refuse to stay hidden, and parents learning (often painfully) that love cannot protect against every fall. With deeply universal themes, the play has resonated across continents, becoming one of the world\u2019s most performed scripts in recent years. \nFamiliar lives, difficult choices, and the tender ache of watching those we love grow in unexpected ways. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Charting Omvedt\u2019s path from America to western Maharashtra, her deep engagement with Dalit-Bahujan politics, and a life of thought and action shaped alongside Patankar, Gail & Bharat\u00a0brings out the personal in the political. \nSet largely in Kasegaon, where the couple lived and worked for decades, the film foregrounds voices and struggles long ignored by mainstream media and academia. It reflects Omvedt\u2019s seminal contributions to anti-caste studies and her role in building global intellectual conversations around Phule and Ambedkar, while also capturing Patankar\u2019s grassroots leadership through movements for land, water, and dignity. Tender, political, and quietly moving, the documentary preserves the legacy of two organic intellectuals whose lives blurred the boundaries between scholarship, activism, and everyday care. \nThe screening will be followed by a conversation with filmmaker Somnath Waghmare, and subsequently a Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "A tradition stays alive not by preservation alone, but by the courage to reimagine. \nThis concert pays homage to the Hindustani classical musicians of the 20th century: artists who honoured an ancient lineage while boldly reshaping it for a changing world. As India awakened to independence, they too evolved with it, expanding melodic possibilities, reimagining rhythm, and infusing contemporary thought into timeless ragas. Legends such as Pt. Dinkar Kaikini, Pt. Kumar Gandharva, Vid. Prabha Atre, Vid. Veena Sahasrabuddhe, Begum Akhtar, and Farida Khanum helped forge a modern, resonant Hindustani idiom whose influence endures today. \nMaahi and Neil revisit this rich inheritance through ragas like Yaman Kalyan, Bihag, Multani, and Bhairavi, alongside select semi-classical pieces. Both artistes will present vocal works. Maahi will be accompanied by Neil on the Appalachian dulcimer, while Neil\u2019s performance will feature Aniket on classical electric guitar. Kaushik will provide the rhythmic accompaniment on tabla for both. \nAn evening to honour the musicians who made this music timeless. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Through voices of local communities, researchers, and conservationists, it challenges the hierarchy of what is deemed worthy of care, asking what happens when we fail to protect what is not glorified. \nThis film is a mark of the wider movement calling for attention, humility, and responsibility toward ecosystems that quietly sustain us all. \nThe screening is followed by a conversation with filmmaker Sumanth Kuduvalli and behavioural ecologist Kavita Isvaran, concluding with an audience Q&A. \n",
