    "description": "Dhrupad is one of the oldest pristine art forms that textures the Indian musical system. Join us for an evening of Dhrupad, reimagined by two young and talented Dhrupadiyas. \nMurali Mohan Gowda will introduce the basic concepts and techniques of Dhrupad, specifically related to Dagarbani and Raga music in general. He will cover topics including the basic differences between Dhrupad and other forms of Indian classical music, the origin of Dhrupad, the concept of Ragas, structure and improvisational tools, and Talas and compositions. \nIn the second part of the concert, Shilpa Shankar Narrain will explore unique aspects of Muthuswami Dikshitar\u2019s compositions from a Dhrupad perspective. Considered one of the holy trinity of Carnatic music, Dikshitar traveled far and wide, and it is believed he lived in Varanasi for eight years. During this time, he was greatly influenced by Dhrupad and is known to have composed various kritis with Dhrupad and Hindustani elements. \nCome and be part of a musical journey that bridges the past and the present, honoring the legacy of Dhrupad while exploring its future possibilities. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "The book The Politics of Modern Indian Language Literature examines various works of literature, focusing on prose narrative forms such as novels, short stories, memoirs and plays. It deals with works by 25 different writers in 14 languages including those from the religious minorities, marginalised sections and ethnic groups such as those from Kashmir and Manipur, and also women writers from across India. The thrust of the book is primarily the politics of the writing and the common concerns that surface in the selected works. Since so many languages are covered, the works are studied in English language translation and important are primarily the concerns and attitudes of the writers as they are revealed in\u00a0the translated\u00a0works. \nThe book tries to look beyond the expressed concerns of each writer at covert significations if any. The discussion is expected to shed light on issues pertaining to Indian language literature after 1947, since this is the first book on the subject to scrutinize it in this way. \nThe author MK Raghavendra will be in conversation with Chiranjiv Singh, IAS and N Vidyashankar Jois, both of whom have been highly active culturally in Bengaluru. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n",

    "description": "The design of the IIM Bangalore (IIMB) campus has evolved through contributions from multiple architects over time, yet its adaptable built and open spaces seem to have allowed it to develop into a cohesive and integrated entity. The book The Making of a Campus: IIM Bangalore shares how this campus came into being and how it has been experienced over time. Through its pages, the book reveals the thought processes, design philosophies, and the interplay between architecture and community that have contributed to the campus\u2019s continuing appeal and functionality. \nUsing the book as a starting point, the session will explore how a shared design philosophy has imbued the campus with a sense of timelessness. This project, conceived and executed by architects Balkrishna Doshi and Achyut Kanvinde with subsequent additions by Sanjay Mohe & Medappa, stands as a testament to the enduring design. \nThe session will commence with an introduction by the book\u2019s author, Kiran Keswani, followed by insights from Bijoy Ramachandran, who has produced two documentary films on Doshi. Subsequently, architects Sanjay Mohe and Medappa will present their contributions to the campus design, sharing their discoveries, challenges, and outcomes. The event will conclude with a dialogue on \u2018creative collaboration\u2019 among the speakers and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Entertaining the nobility of India, her life was different from the other women around her. She had financial independence, she could choose her patrons and partners, and most importantly, she was highly skilled at her art, her music! \nTawaifs and women performers were given a reputation, one that made their life difficult and tainted them as prostitutes and sex workers. Unfortunately, history doesn\u2019t credit them enough for their most valuable contribution to Indian Culture, their Music! Even though they were known for Thumri, Dadra, other semiclassical forms like hori, jhoola, chaiti and so on, they were the first performers to set ghazals to tune and bring them to the performance space as a music genre. This performance will be tracing the evolution of this beautiful genre that gained popularity through the performance of Tawaifs and many other women performers over the years. \nO Gaanewali invites you on a journey through the rich cultural heritage of Indian music, sharing fascinating stories and anecdotes as it introduces iconic forms like thumri, dadra, hori, chaiti, and ghazal, made famous by the legendary Tawaifs and the many talented women who followed in their footsteps \nCreated for lovers for Ghazal, this format explores a slightly later time period in the lives of these artists, taking the audience through a nostalgic musical journey. Expect to hear some evergreen Ghazals like Aye Muhobbat Tere Anjaam Pe Rona Aya, Hum Dekhenge, Woh Jo Hum Mein Tum Mein Qarar Tha, Mere Humnafas and more! \nSupported by: \n \n",

However, this project has not progressed beyond a few meetings and the initial proposal stage. Meanwhile, the past year has seen the condition of handloom weavers decline further, reaching a state of emergency. Without proper access to markets and design interventions, they are unable to realise the true value of their traditional skills. \nAs we face increasing natural disasters, periods of flood and drought, and the looming climate catastrophe, ecologically sustainable rural industries such as handlooms and khadi can provide sustainable employment opportunities without harming nature.

    "description": "In this talk, Professor Ashutosh Varshney, will delve into the paradoxes and complexities of India\u2019s democratic journey. Drawing on his extensive research, he will explore India\u2019s resilience as the world\u2019s largest democracy and its challenges in maintaining liberal democratic norms. He will examine India\u2019s democratic trajectory, highlighting the foundational choices made by political elites that have contributed to its stability since independence in 1947, contrasting India\u2019s vibrant electoral democracy with the recent decline in democratic standards observed since 2014, marked by the erosion of civil liberties, minority rights, and checks on executive power. By comparing India\u2019s experience with other democracies worldwide, particularly in the developing world, he will provide a comprehensive analysis using global indices and datasets such as V-Dem, offering insights into how India\u2019s democratic credentials measure up globally. \nProfessor Varshney will also discuss the critical role of political elites and civil society in sustaining and undermining democratic governance. He will emphasise the importance of elite values and interests in shaping democratic trajectories and offer recommendations for reinforcing democratic norms and institutions in India. Strategies for reversing democratic backsliding, the significance of free and fair elections, a robust civil society, and the role of international support for democracy will be key points of discussion. This talk promises to offer profound insights and provoke thoughtful discussion on the state and future of democracy in India. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Wild Women: Seekers, Protagonists and Goddesses in Sacred Indian Poetry\u00a0[Penguin India, 2024], edited by poet and seeker Arundhathi Subramaniam, is a new anthology of compelling women mystics in Indian literature. \nThese poems are the cries of women who refused, quietly, and sometimes not so quietly, to be bullied into submission. Women who surrendered not to the authority of the world, but to the authority of the spirit. Women whose voices have far too often been sanitized by the grand narratives of religion and sidelined by rationalist versions of history. \nThe names of Mirabai, Akka Mahadevi, and Andal, are known to many. But there are innumerable others. And little is known of the urgency of their words, of their feral sensuality, of their relentless questioning of\u00a0the custodians of gender and faith. It is time to re-fang them, to tune into their brazenness and heartbreaking longing. Not just for their sake, but for ours. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Author Arundhathi Subramaniam is in conversation with Poet & Translator, Mani Rao, with\u00a0readings of translations by Mani Rao, Vanamala Viswanatha and Ahalya Ballal.\u00a0This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in June 2024. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!

    "description": "Seventy-five years after Independence, India has much to be proud of. We are both the world\u2019s biggest democracy and the fastest-growing large economy.

    "description": "\u201cShruthi Maatha, Laya Pitah\u201d is a famous saying where Shruthi and Layam are seen as two most important fundamentals of music. Layam is a basic rhythm that flows through any movement, expressed as Thaalam (beats). There is an implicit Layam and explicit Layam. The former is something that has to be realised for the latter to be grounded into one\u2019s sensibilities and mind. \nMany music composers have explored this layam aspect of music, but the Trinity (Thyagarajaswamy , Muthuswamy Deekshitar and Shyama Saastrigal) stand out in this. Just like in Raagam, in Layam also they have many firsts. The basic framework of tala dasha pranas have also been used by them intelligently in their kritis. \nThis presentation will look at that basic framework of layam and how trinity made it shine even better, both intuitive and explicit. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "\n\nKannada, English, Manipuri with English Subtitles | 125 minutes | Suitable for 14+ years \nPrateek Prajosh\u2019s debut feature as director, \u2018Chilli Chicken\u2019 is a\u00a0thought-provoking Kannada film that attempts an authentic portrayal of Northeast Indian migrant workers navigating life in urban Bengaluru. \nFollowing the screening, the director and team will be in conversation with Laishram Romal Singh as they explore the film\u2019s themes of identity, discrimination, and cultural integration. \nThis event is part of our \u2018Meet the Maker\u2019 series and will be an evening of cinema and conversation, shedding light on the often-overlooked experiences of migrant workers in India\u2019s bustling cities. \nSynopsis \nFive migrant workers from the North East \u2013 Ajoy, Khaba, Jason, Jimpa and Ranjoy (Ajoy\u2019s cousin) \u2013 find themselves in the heart of Bengaluru, working for Adarsh, a second-grade restaurant owner of \u2018Noodle Home\u2019, who aspires to open a fine dining restaurant, Noodle Palace, one day. \nHis ambitious yet delusional plans take a turn for the worse when his most promising employee, Ajay, dies under mysterious circumstances on the restaurant premises, leaving each one of the boys guilt-ridden, unsure of the events that transpired and uncertain of what the future holds. \nWith a suspicious Ranjoy keen on uncovering the mystery surrounding his cousin\u2019s death and a cash-strapped Adarsh re-evaluating options to open his new restaurant, the rest are forced to fend for themselves and safeguard their own survival. How does Adarsh navigate through the tricky state of affairs while his boys combat racism, abuse and numerous other problems? \nAbout the Film \n\n\nIn \u201cChilli Chicken,\u201d the narrative is deeply enriched by characters hailing from Assam and Manipur, bringing to the screen an authentic portrayal that delves into the cultural wealth and unique societal challenges faced by these communities in urban India. These Northeastern protagonists not only add layers of complexity to the story with their diverse backgrounds but also highlight pressing issues like racial discrimination and identity struggles. Central to the film\u2019s plot and social critique, their individual and collective experiences offer a nuanced perspective that is as enlightening as it is engaging. Their representation in the film transcends mere entertainment; it educates and builds bridges, challenging entrenched stereotypes. By sharing their journey, \u201cChilli Chicken\u201d becomes a potent vehicle for promoting understanding and inclusivity, and celebrates the stories of Assam and Manipur, fostering a richer cultural dialogue within the cinematic landscape. \nCredits: \nDirector: Prateek Prajosh\nWriter: KAS & Prateek Prajosh\nMusic director: Siddhanth Sundar \nCast:\nShrunga BV\nBijou Thaangjam\nRini\nNithyashri\nVictor Thoudam\nJimpa Bhutia \n",
