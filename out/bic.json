    "description": "Scholars of international relations, political thought, and India\u2019s diplomatic history continue to debate the meaning and relevance of non-alignment in India\u2019s foreign policy today. The origins of these debates lie in Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s articulation of non-alignment at the height of the Cold War, a concept both resolute and ambiguous. \nIn this talk, Dr. Swapna Kona Nayudu will draw on her acclaimed book, The Nehru Years: An International History of Indian Non-Alignment (Cambridge University Press UK, Juggernaut Books India), to explore how India\u2019s approach to international affairs and the United Nations now understood in summary as non-alignment. Based on meticulous archival research in multiple languages, her work uncovers India\u2019s diplomatic and peacekeeping contributions in pivotal global events such as the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Hungarian Revolution, and the Congo Crisis. \nTracing the evolution of non-alignment from Nehru\u2019s time to the present, Dr. Kona Nayudu will examine its contested meaning and its influence on India\u2019s position as the only non-aligned founding member of the UN. \nDr. Kona Nayudu will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "How do we honour truths without exploitation or erasure? \nThis panel discussion will explore how the chapter of Partition is remembered, who holds the responsibility of preserving its stories, and what it means to give them an honest voice. Through literature, oral testimony, archives, or immersive media, each speaker has engaged with histories marked by silence, trauma, and survival. In this session, they will reflect on the choices they have made: to amplify certain voices, to tell different stories with care, and to avoid reducing complex truths into simplified narratives. \nAt the heart of this conversation is a shared responsibility; not only as writers, educators, or artists, but as individuals shaped by inherited memory. As Partition fades from lived memory, this panel asks how the stories we carry today might shape the understanding of future generations, and the ways they remember, question, and imagine. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "Step into a heartfelt journey across time and tradition. In this special performance, the untouched poetic gems of Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharathiyar are brought to life, exploring the vision and passion behind words he once held close. \nOur story begins with the late Prof. K. V. Krishnan from Varanasi, Bharathiyar\u2019s own nephew, whose lifelong love for his uncle\u2019s work unearthed these hidden verses. Through his research, we glimpse Bharathiyar not only as a poet but as a dreamer, lighting fires of change. \nThe name Bharathi, born of the Sanskrit \u201cAbh\u0101y\u0101m + Ratah\u201d, means \u201cone who delights in fearlessness.\u201d This performance honors him as a beacon of courage, his words as arms of inspiration. \nThis evening offers a warm celebration of dance and verse; a simple yet powerful tribute to our fiery national poet, whose voice still stirs hearts today. \nCredits \nMusic Direction \u2013 Dr. Rajkumar Bharathi\nVocal & Nattuvangam \u2013 Swati Athmanathan\nMridangam, Tabla & Voiceover \u2013 Sri.

With his signature blend of wit, warmth, and wild storytelling, Anuvab moves from the absurdities of colonial hangovers to the chaotic charm of startups, social media spats, and airline adventures. \nThis isn\u2019t just a stand-up show; it\u2019s a cultural joyride. After sold-out performances in 11 countries and 27 cities, Anuvab now brings back his international tales, asking: what happens when India\u2019s inside jokes meet the world\u2019s outside gaze? \nPraised as \u201chysterically funny\u201d by Time Out and \u201cbrilliant\u201d by the Hindustan Times, Anuvab\u2019s satire strikes a chord with audiences of all ages. Whether you\u2019re nostalgic for Doordarshan or deep into meme culture, his humour finds you and welcomes you in. \nIt\u2019s one evening, many Indias, and more than a few unexpected truths as punchlines. \n",

    "description": "There are many different views on what it means to be free. One popular perspective sees freedom as a form of independence: being free means not being held back or restricted by the expectations, obligations, or interference from others. After explaining the basic idea in more detail, the talk discusses Bob Dylan\u2019s work to illustrate the value of this kind of freedom while noting that some other parts of Dylan\u2019s work seem to question this very idea of freedom. To explore the critique of freedom, the talk turns to Robert Musil\u2019s (1880-1942) unfinished novel The Man Without Qualities. One way to understand this celebrated novel is to see it as a partly hilarious, partly deeply tragic and moving description of putting too much emphasis on an ideal of freedom as independence. Drawing on insights from moral philosophy, the talk suggests that a proper understanding of the relation between independence and personal integrity can lead to a better appreciation of freedom as independence. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the lecture. \nThis lecture is a part of Vidyashilp University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "In Karnatik music, a composer is referred to as a \u2018vaggeyakara\u2019 \u2013 someone who creates both the text (vak) and the music (geya) for a composition. The kirtana is the most important compositional form in Karnatik music. It is a beautiful balance between the sahitya (text), raga (melody) and tala (rhythm). These kirtanas have sprung from the creative flow of melody and text, thus creating a unified aesthetic identity.\u00a0 \nThree eighteenth-century composers, Thyagaraja (1767-1847), Muthusvami Dikshithar (1775-1835) and Shyama Shastri (1762-1827), were masters and innovators of this compositional form, reverentially referred to as the \u2018Trinity\u2019 of Karnatik music. \nThe oldest among the three, Shyama Shastri, composed fewer compositions than his other two contemporaries, but each one of his compositions stand out as a unique piece. He used complex rhythmic structures which give a special quality to his kirtanas. \nThe prolific composer Thyagaraja viewed ragas with utmost clarity and definition. In his kirtanas, you find defined nuggets of the raga\u2019s phrases in almost every line. \nThe esoteric Muthusvami Dikshithar looked at a composition with a different lens. His kirtanas are one whole melodic movement where the raga flows in an unstructured manner, overflowing from one line to another. The deeper one dwells on his compositions, their beauty unravels. \nAt this concert, Sangeetha Sivakumar will be presenting compositions of the Trinity with a special focus on Muthusvami Dikshithar since we are celebrating his 250th birth anniversary this year. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "As global power dynamics continue to shift, the Indo-Pacific sits at the heart of a rapidly evolving strategic and economic landscape. In this timely and wide-ranging session, Peter Varghese, former Australian Foreign Secretary and High Commissioner to India, offers a perspective shaped by decades of diplomacy and deep engagement with the region. \nHis address will explore the complex forces redefining the Indo-Pacific: from the sharpening rivalry between the US and China, to China\u2019s expanding influence and the evolving policy direction in Washington. The session will also examine how key regional players (India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia) are shaping their own responses to these pressures, and what this means for the broader security of the region. \nAlongside geopolitics, the conversation will turn to trade tensions, economic nationalism, and the slowing pace of globalization; factors that now cast long shadows over our economic future. Can traditional regional institutions hold, or will more agile, interest-based minilateral groups take their place? \nFollowing his presentation, Peter Varghese will converse with Latha Reddy, Nitin Pai, and Ranjan Mathai. The evening concludes with an audience Q&A, inviting reflections on a region that will shape the 21st century. \n",

From intergenerational recipes to the shifting ecology of Indian agriculture, it traces how food connects families and communities across time. It also considers how the sensory experience of food\u2014its taste, texture, and smell\u2014can be evoked through image and design, inviting us to see food not just as nourishment, but as story, culture, and art. \nA feast for the eyes, the Visual Encyclopedia of Indian Foods is a celebration of India\u2019s edible heritage. \nIn this landmark work, photographer and storyteller Priya Mani offers an ingredient-led journey through the country\u2019s vast culinary landscape. With images that feel both scientific and sacred, Mani transforms everyday ingredients into tableaus of cultural history: where grains, leaves, spices, and tools become portraits of memory and meaning. \nFar more than a cookbook or catalog, the Visual Encyclopedia of Indian Foods weaves together the stories behind what we eat: the seasons that shape our crops, the tools that grind and stir, the vessels that hold and serve, and the communities that grow, cook, and share. Each photograph is accompanied by accessible, insightful text that grounds the visuals in context and highlights connections. \nThis is India\u2019s food story told through form, color, and the quiet power of detail.\n \n",

    "description": "Language: English \nWhen the rules of love are rewritten, what\u2019s left standing? \nDario Fo\u2019s The Open Couple is a bold, sharp, and darkly comic exploration of modern relationships pushed to the edge. What begins as a provocative experiment (a husband proposing an open marriage) quickly spirals into chaos, confrontation, and unexpected revelations. \nSet against the backdrop of shifting gender roles and social expectations, the play peels back the layers of a marriage unravelling. With biting wit and disarming vulnerability, Fo exposes the emotional toll of jealousy, the absurdity of control, and the fragile line between freedom and fear. The couple\u2019s battles are fast, funny, and painfully familiar, as they try to navigate the messy terrain of love, power, and identity. \nThrough its rapid dialogue and theatrical twists, The Open Couple holds up a mirror to our ideas of commitment and connection; asking what we\u2019re really seeking when we ask for more. \nA deeply human comedy that leaves room for both laughter and reckoning. \nCredits:\nWriter : Dario Fo\nDirector : Faraz Khan\nCreative Producer : Ragini Roychowdhury\nActors : Vaishali Bisht & Rohan Joshi\nSound : Charvi Ojha \nSupported by:\n \n",

Originally launched online in 2022 by ReReeti in partnership with the British Council and Glasgow Life Museums, this exhibition is now being reimagined as a physical, immersive experience. It is especially relevant for young people who have only ever encountered Partition through textbook chapters and distorted narratives. \nCurated by ReReeti, designed by Aditi Dhamija, and in collaboration with the Bangalore International Centre, this exhibition urges participants to deeply feel the emotional weight of forced, mass migration. The digital interactives serve as the core touch point, but the stories extend beyond the screen. Spilling into the physical space as tactile, atmospheric, and visually compelling encounters, visitors navigate through stories of displacement \u2013 stories based on real accounts of families. You will face difficult choices on behalf of characters, driven by fear, survival, and the need to protect their families. \nWhile Partition impacted families across the subcontinent, its realities are often distant in southern India. This exhibition opens space for reflection and conversation, prompting visitors to connect personally with questions of identity, loss, memory, and inter-generational resilience. \nThe hope is to change how future generations choose to carry our history forward. \nPlease note: Kids below age 6 will not be allowed inside the Gallery space. \nClick here to know more about the Panel Discussion. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n\u00a0 \n",

When our children focus on rote learning and exam-based academic progress, how do we nurture the inventive Indian who can fuel the imagination of the world with creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving? What if classrooms became labs of imagination, not factories of repetition? \nThese are the questions that the Agastya International Foundation set out to answer 25 years ago, by designing a curiosity-driven, experiential learning model that has transformed education across India. Today, their vision of sparking curiosity, nurturing creativity and instilling confidence and caring has impacted over 25 million schoolchildren and 300,000 teachers in government schools across 23 Indian States. \nAn acclaimed new book from Penguin Random House, The Moving of Mountains traces Agastya\u2019s extraordinary journey in reshaping the classroom by replacing rote learning with hands-on experiments, creative projects and interactive models in science, art and ecology. \nJoin us in a discussion of why this powerful vision for curiosity-driven, experiential learning is critical to the future of India, and has caught the imagination of scientists, industry leaders, educationists and policy makers alike. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n",

Here, the story of Maya and Karim \u2014 lovers navigating the complexities of migration, racial identity, and political uncertainty in Brexit-era London \u2014 unfolds alongside the author\u2019s own candid reflections. Kandasamy\u2019s marginalia form a vivid scaffolding around the narrative, exposing the porous boundaries where life is transformed into fiction. \nThis conversation, featuring Meena Kandasamy and Samhita Arni, will delve into the book\u2019s innovative split-screen structure, where text and context share equal footing and readers are invited to question the very art of reading. Together, they will discuss how formal experimentation confronts literary expectations, challenges the marginalization of writers from the Global South, and connects the intimate landscapes of relationships to broader public histories. Join us and hear how their own experiences shape, and resist, the expectations placed on women writers, and how they transform storytelling into protest, play, and polemic. \n",

    "description": "123 minutes | Japanese with English subtitles | Japan | 2023 \nWriter & Director: Wim Wenders\nScriptwriter: Takuma Takasaki\nStarring: Koji Yakusho,\u00a0Tokio Emoto,\u00a0Arisa Nakano,\u00a0Aoi Yamada, and others.\nComposer: Patrick Watson \nA quiet life with all its nuances, beautifully observed. \nLegendary filmmaker Wim Wenders returns to fiction with a luminous story set in the heart of Tokyo, where the extraordinary hides in plain sight. At its center is Hirayama, played with quiet brilliance by Cannes 2023 Best Actor Koji Yakusho. He finds peace and purpose in the rhythms of his days: tending to the city\u2019s public toilets, listening to old cassette tapes, reading paperbacks, and capturing light through a camera lens. \nBut beneath his seemingly simple routine lies a life shaped by memory, mystery, and choice. As gentle disruptions begin to ripple through his orderly world, we\u2019re invited into a meditation on solitude, dignity, and the invisible richness of everyday existence. \nWenders, long admired for his contemplative, human-centered cinema, draws inspiration from Ozu while offering a rare, unromanticized view of Tokyo; one that honours its quiet workers and fleeting beauty. With a nostalgic soundtrack and a deeply empathetic gaze, Perfect Days is a film that lingers long after it ends. \nNominated for Best International Film at the 96th Academy Awards, this is a cinematic poem for anyone who\u2019s ever found meaning in a daily ritual, or longed to. \nWim Wenders, born in 1945, is a celebrated German filmmaker and a leading voice of New German Cinema. Rising to prominence in the 1970s, he is known for his deeply human films and visual storytelling across fiction, documentary, photography, and writing. A former film critic and co-founder of Filmverlag der Autoren, Wenders gained early acclaim with The American Friend and his iconic road movie trilogy. He won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes for Paris, Texas and earned Oscar nominations for Buena Vista Social Club and Pina. His work continues to shape global cinema with emotional depth and artistic innovation. \nThis is the second film in our collaboration with MUBI. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience! \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "What happens when a defiant chronicler and an idealist revolutionary converge in the\u00a0playground that is India\u2019s freedom struggle? Urdu newspaper Pratap, launched in pre-partition India, was a torchbearer against the British Raj. The man who publicly defended it\u00a0against colonial censorship was none other than Jawaharlal Nehru. \nThe pen picked up by freedom fighter Virendra, the paper\u2019s editor and the founder\u2019s son who once walked shoulder to shoulder with stalwarts like Bhagat Singh was equally fearless\u00a0despite threats by the imperial government, Indira Gandhi\u2019s Emergency and a parcel bomb\u00a0sent to Pratap\u2019s office during terrorism in Punjab. \nVirendra was first arrested in the historic Saunders murder case. He was also in jail with\u00a0Bhagat Singh the day the legendary revolutionary was hanged, sharing a rare first-hand\u00a0witness account. In Independent India, too footsteps filled Pratap and its editors with dread\u00a0and terror. \nPratap: A Defiant Newspaper\u00a0is a timely reminder of the ethos of a struggle, a template for\u00a0speaking truth to power at all costs. It is the story of a perfect storm. The book is written by Virendra\u2019s son, distinguished editor Chander Mohan and journalist granddaughter Jyotsna Mohan. Jyotsna and Azeezullah Baig will be in conversation with Maya Sharma. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Jyotsna Mohan and Azeezullah Baig will be in conversation with Maya Sharma. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in Jun 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Overcast, Audible, and Amazon Music. \n",

    "description": "Born in Europe and reshaped in Calcutta, the harmonium arrived in India\u2019s classical music world with baggage: too rigid, too foreign, and too limited. Critics called it unfit for the fluidity of Indian ragas. All India Radio banned it for thirty years.\u00a0 \nAnd yet, it endured. Its warm, resonant tones have become the soulful undercurrent to melodious ghazals, emotional bhajans, and classical ragas. \nThis evening, journey through that remarkable evolution with Dr. Ravindra Katoti, one of India\u2019s leading harmonium maestros, in conversation with celebrated vocalist Sri Dhananjay Hegde. With Sri Yogesh Bhat on tabla, they bring alive the stories, struggles, and triumphs of this powerful instrument. \nAn evening of sound, memory, and musical legacy awaits. \nSupported by: \n \n",
