    "description": "There is a force of existence, which can not be contained by space, or bound by time, yet it is the one that creates the many dimensions, patterns and emotions. This is the perpetual dance of existence, N\u0101d\u0101nt, without a beginning or an end, and at the very centre is, Lord Shiva. \nN\u0101d\u0101nt, is an exploration by Divya Goswami, navigating through the leela of the manifest form of the cosmic dancer and the visual discourse on the true purpose of existence; until there is no more. This 80 minute production, juxtaposes the dyads within Shiva, who moves like the ripples on the placid countenance, while bubbling on the surface into a volcanic fury. He reveals and revells in his form, preparing and inviting the devotee. Slowly, the seeker understands the secrets to his ominous form, adorned with serpents, ash, fire, as a mere illusion, playing out the rhythm of everyday life. \nThe resonating drum, the rhythmic pneumonics, the multilayered words, become a vehicle to find the self, discarding the fetters, step by step. N\u0101d\u0101nt is the sojourn of a seeker, as she praises, admires, unravels the mystery behind the cosmic dancer only to witness, partake, merge into the abstraction of the divine energy. \nSupported by: \n \n",

In his quest to document mammals and avifauna in their natural habitats, he has not only immortalized their beauty but also delved into the rich tapestry of history, culture, and indigenous tribes across these diverse landscapes. \nThroughout his travels, Pradeep has discovered that while wildlife may be ubiquitous, their ability to adapt to varying terrains and climates in pursuit of sustenance is a captivating phenomenon. Witnessing firsthand the anatomical adaptations these creatures have undergone over time, as well as observing the grand spectacle of animal behavior, such as the awe-inspiring Great Migration of Wildebeest, has left an indelible mark on his perspective. \nThe talk will be followed by a moderated conversation and a Q&A session with the audience. \n",
