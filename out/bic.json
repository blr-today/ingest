    "description": "An Advance Medical Directive (AMD) (usually misunderstood as a Living Will) recognizes the right of a person to choose the nature of medical treatment that he/she would like to be withheld. It is an extension of the principle of the right to die with dignity. An AMD is a person\u2019s advanced exercise of autonomy on the subject of the level of medical intervention they intend to accept on their own body at a time when they may not be able to express their views. The objective and intent of an AMD are to convey a person\u2019s medical care preferences if they lose their ability to make decisions. \nIn March 2018, the Supreme Court of India, in a landmark judgement, recognized the right of a terminally ill person to execute an Advance Medical Directive. AMD helps in protecting basic human autonomy, while also shedding light on the concept of dignity in death. However, it is still a new concept in India and early last year the Supreme Court modified its guidelines for the execution of the Living Will. \nThis session by Mr. Shiv Kumar will delve into the Advanced Medical Directive and will examine the ingredients of an AMD, its legal nuances, how and when it can be made, and its consequences. It will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience and enable a discussion on the barriers that\u00a0impact the efficacy of the AMD. \nIn collaboration with Silver Talkies, a social enterprise focused on making active ageing a desirable and viable goal for older adults:\n \n",

    "description": "In India, the question of whether voters are truly getting what they vote for remains a complex and often debated issue. While elections provide a platform for citizens to express their preferences and hold their representatives accountable, challenges such as electoral misconduct, corruption, and the influence of money and power continue to cast doubt on the efficacy of the electoral process. Moreover, the disconnect between campaign promises and actual governance outcomes further muddles the picture. Despite strides in transparency and electoral reforms, the gap between voter expectations and political realities underscores the need for sustained efforts to enhance accountability, strengthen institutions, and foster a more responsive and inclusive democracy. \nCultivating Democracy: Politics and Citizenship in Agrarian India by Mukulika Banerjee is an anthropological study of the relationship of formal political democracy and the cultivation of active citizenship in one particular rural setting in India, studied from 1998 to 2013. It draws on deep ethnographic engagement with the people and social life in two villages, both during elections and in the time in between them, to show how these two temporalities connect. The analysis shows how an agrarian village society produces the social imaginaries required for democratic and republican values. The ethnographic microscope on a single paddy growing setting allows us to examine how the various social institutions of kinship, economy, and religion are critical sites for the continual civic cultivation of cooperation, vigilance, redistribution, inviolate commitment, and hope\u2014values that are essential for democracy. \nA talk by Mukulika Banerjee will be followed by a\u00a0discussion with A Narayana, moderated by Tara Krishnaswamy and a Q&A session with the audience. \nThis event is a part of BIC\u2019s Election series. \n",

    "description": "\nDvijottama is the narrative of one of the greatest warriors of the Bharatha war \u2013 Drona. A man born to educate also finds the need to fight.

    "description": "Discussions surrounding China and India\u2019s relationship remain urgent and crucial due to their geopolitical significance, economic interdependence, and potential for conflict. As two of the world\u2019s most populous nations and emerging global powers, their interactions shape regional stability and have far-reaching implications for international relations. With ongoing territorial disputes, trade tensions, and differing strategic interests, understanding and managing their relationship is vital for fostering cooperation, averting conflicts, and navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing world order. \nExploring themes from his book Beyond Binaries: The World of India and China based on his writings on India, China and their often-tumultuous relationship, Shastri Ramachandaran unravels a succinct history of how ties between the two Asian neighbours have evolved over the 15 years from 2008\u20132022 and the internal and bilateral compulsions that shaped them. The book makes the reader aware about the strategic thinking that went into each move and counter-move by the two nations that are often at odds with each other, as they are at present. It is an attempt to deepen understanding of the recent history of Sino-Indian relations and, as the title suggests, look at India-China relations without putting it in the category of good or bad. \nIn this session, author Shastri Ramachandran will be in conversation with Manoj Kewalramani taking the listener beyond the binaries in which perceptions of India and China, their relationship and their role on the world stage is trapped. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nThis is the first event in BIC\u2019s two-part China Series. \n",

    "description": "90 minutes | English and Hindi | Mature Content for Ages 16+ \nTrigger Warnings: Suicide & Self Harm \nA two-actor black comedy about life, death, and everything in between. A successful female executive is ready to commit suicide by jumping off a roof when a male cab driver saves her. \nThis sets the stage for a collision between two completely opposite worlds, personalities,\ncircumstances, beliefs, and perspectives. Despite their contrasting socio-economic classes, backgrounds, and lifestyles, this unusual encounter leads to a night of pure and simple human connection. \nWill the man be able to truly save her, or will she be back to jump again? \nThe play explores the themes of suicide, depression, loneliness, happiness, love, having or not having a purpose in life, and ultimately death, creating an emotionally complex and thought-provoking experience for the audience. Jump delves into the human psyche, showcasing the struggles, challenges, and aspirations of two very different individuals who would never meet in normal circumstances but find a unique connection in the most unexpected of places and in their shared\nhumanity. \nDirector\u2019s Note \nApart from being an actor and director, I\u2019m also a mountaineer. I was in an advanced mountaineering course trying to summit a Himalayan mountain in October 2022. An avalanche came, and we lost 29 people out of a batch of 53 people. I somehow survived the incident and escaped death. The incident changed me, my core beliefs, and my perspective on living life. For the first time, I felt depressed and tried therapy. The incident left me with a lot of questions. WHO recently declared loneliness a \u2018global public health concern\u2019. In India, 1 in every 5 individuals suffers from some form of mental health illness, and over 2.6 lakh cases of suicide occur in a year. \nGiven these alarming numbers, considering and addressing mental health is still at a very early stage in India. In a post-pandemic world, the alarming rise in suicide, depression, and loneliness rates around the world shows that our pursuit of success and materialistic goals doesn\u2019t lead us to genuine happiness and fulfilment. In the world of social media, because of personal, sociological, political, and geographical reasons, we feel disconnected more than ever before. We often witness instances where seemingly successful and happy individuals suddenly take their own lives. In spite of the number of self-help books, motivational speakers, and influencers preaching about finding life\u2019s purpose, a significant portion of us are just trying to survive. \nOur individual perspectives play a significant role in shaping our lives. We tend to surround ourselves with like-minded people who share similar perspectives. We believe that our own perspective is the\nultimate and only valid one. If we look closely enough, all the conflicts in the world are just a clash of different and opposing perspectives. \nThe essence of Jump lies in the meeting of these two contrasting characters, identities, perspectives, lifestyles, and worlds within a highly unusual situation. \nAbout Collective Madness\nEvery project for us is an attempt to find a unique connection with our audience around the ideas we believe in. Collective Madness Studios, established in 2004, is a platform for anyone who believes that theatre is a practicing art form and provides a space for those who are passionately attached to theatre.

    "description": "This discussion will examine the intricate realm of sleep through the dual perspectives of modern scientific knowledge and ancient Eastern wisdom. \nDespite significant advancements in knowledge, there remain uncharted territories in our comprehension of sleep. Do underlying physiological factors hinder restful sleep, and could individualised combinations of root causes contribute to the sleep challenges faced by each person? When viewed through the contrasting lenses of science and ancient wisdom, sleep challenges may manifest differently. Is there a way to harmonise the insights from both realms for a more comprehensive understanding? Exploring the scientific intricacies of the body\u2019s systems alongside the ancient principles of Ayurveda, particularly the concept of the three doshas, presents a promising avenue. This approach aims to transcend dichotomies and foster a synergistic relationship between various perspectives. \nFollowing two presentations by Deepa Kannan, author of the book How To Sleep Better-The Miraculous 10-Step Protocol To Recharge Your Mind & Body,\u00a0and Dr Uma Maheswari Krishnaswamy will be a dialogue moderated by writer Thomas Abraham and a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "In the era of electoral bonds, the costs of political corruption demand scrutiny. Today\u2019s corruption differs vastly from that of a decade or two ago, altering its associated consequences. \nThe captive coal block allocation scandal entrenched oligarchy by favoring select families, while in states like Punjab, corruption consolidates power within a single family, depriving the state of revenue. Presently, India witnesses a surge in a rent-sharing model, akin to a mafia state, where government support disproportionately benefits chosen firms. This breakdown in the citizen-party social contract prompts reporter M Rajshekhar to analyze its origins and effects. \nAbout Narayan Dutt:\nMr Narayan Dutt was a Hindi journalist. He retired as the Features Editor of PTI Hindi division. He was earlier Editor of Navaneet, a Hindi digest, for many years. He was highly regarded by his peers and received honours such as the Sri Ganesh Shanker Vidhyarthi Puraskar bestowed by the President of India, and an Honorary D.

It will illustrate, with examples from long term studies of ecology\u00a0of tigers and other large carnivores, and their prey, how the quality of goals we set, methods\u00a0we use and data we gather, are all critical elements in accomplishing effective outcomes\u00a0for wild species under varied threats in our changing world. \nThe session will begin with a talk by Ullas Karanth followed by a conversation with\u00a0N. Samba Kumar and\u00a0Arjun M Gopalaswamy and a Q&A session with the audience. \nImage credit:\nThumbnail photo of Three Tigers: Diinesh Kumble\nHeader: Eleanor Briggs \n",

    "description": "This talk draws from Matthias Mahlmann\u2019s recent critically acclaimed book, Mind and Rights: The history, law and psychology of Human Rights published in open access mode by Cambridge University Press in February 2023.\u00a0 The talk critically examines the growth of the concept of human rights, its roots in history and current human rights theories. It scrutinizes in particular the myth of the Western origin of the idea of human rights by highlighting the many roots of human rights in different cultures, including within the Global South and indigenous cultures. \nA particular goal of the talk is to engage with the so-called cognitive revolution and to investigate the relationship between human cognition and human rights.\u00a0 The talk will argue that insights gained from modern theories of the mind can deepen our understanding of the foundation of human rights. The talk also seeks to answer the question whether the current attacks on democracy can be countered through the use of human rights and its underlying political ethics of egalitarian dignity. Finally, the talk will contend that the pursuit of the human rights idea, with its achievements and tragic failures, is key to understanding what kind of beings humans are. Such self-knowledge is crucial in times in which the human species has put its own survival at risk. \nA conversation between the author, Matthias Mahlmann, and the discussant, Sudhir Krishnaswamy, will be followed by a moderated Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",
