    "description": "1973 | 82 Minutes | Hindi with English Subtitles \nBased on a Rajasthani folktale retold by Vijayadan Detha, Duvidha is about a merchant\u2019s son, whose relationship with his young bride, Lachhi is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her, resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband. \nCalling all cinephiles! BIC is thrilled to present B\u2022Cinematic, an initiative dedicated to celebrating the most essential, impactful, and artistically significant cinematic works from across the state and the country. \nAt B\u2022Cinematic, our mission is to curate and share those remarkable films that is a must-watch (or re-watch) experience for every passionate cinema lover. From groundbreaking classics to under-appreciated gems, our carefully curated selection will take you on an unparalleled (pun not intended) cinematic journey through the ages. \nThrough curated screenings, insightful discussions, and engaging analyses from distinguished cinematic voices, we aim to not only watch these films together but to truly appreciate their craftsmanship, cultural impact, and intellectual depth. Our vibrant community of film aficionados will collectively rediscover Indian cinema\u2019s most stunning and enduring masterpieces. \nSo join us on this quest to experience the films that have defined and redefined the art form. Don\u2019t miss out on crossing these essential works off your bucket list. Because to truly live, you must first watch the films that make life worth living. \nThis month\u2019s film featured in our informal film club is Duvidha\u00a0(1973) \nDuvidha is a hauntingly beautiful and thought-provoking film that delves into the realms of folklore, desire, and the complexities of human relationships. Based on a Rajasthani folktale, the film weaves a captivating tale of a young bride, Lachhi, whose newfound marriage is immediately put to the test by circumstances beyond her control. \nOn the very day of their wedding, Lachhi\u2019s husband, a merchant\u2019s son, departs on a five-year business trip, leaving her behind in the care of his family. Amidst this lonely existence, a mischievous and longing ghost, enchanted by Lachhi\u2019s beauty, devises a cunning plan to impersonate her husband and gain her affection. \nDirector Mani Kaul\u2019s masterful storytelling and Navroze Contractor\u2019s exceptional cinematography breathe life into this enigmatic narrative, creating a hypnotic and surreal atmosphere that blurs the boundaries between the corporeal and the ethereal. The film\u2019s striking visuals, infused with rich textures and rhythmic sequences, transport the viewer into the vibrant tapestry of Rajasthani culture, where the rhythms of daily life intertwine with the spectral realm. \nAt its core, Duvidha is a metaphysical exploration of love, desire, and the complexities of human relationships. The ghost\u2019s obsession with Lachhi and his subsequent impersonation of her husband raise profound questions about identity, fidelity, and the nature of love itself. The film invites the viewer to ponder the depths of human longing and the lengths to which one might go to satisfy that longing. \nBeyond its captivating narrative, Duvidha also serves as a powerful commentary on societal norms and gender dynamics. Lachhi\u2019s predicament, torn between her duty as a wife and the allure of the supernatural, reflects the constraints and expectations placed upon women in traditional societies. The film subtly challenges these conventions, inviting the viewer to question the foundations upon which societal structures are built. \nUltimately, Duvidha is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its folktale origins, offering a transcendent and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition. With its mesmerizing visuals, haunting narrative, and profound themes, the film continues to resonate with audiences, inviting them to embark on a journey that blends the fantastical with the deeply human. \n",

We will showcase a distinctive collection of cinematic narratives centered on the theme of carbon and bring to life stories that span generations, reflecting both the past and the ever-evolving present. These stories of ambition, resilience, and perseverance will offer a deeper understanding of carbon and films, shedding light on the transformative power of carbon. \nThe festival strives to create an immersive environment where visitors can deeply interact with these ideas through various films and discussions. We are offering a wide array of films spanning different languages, including German, English, French, and Hindi, and genres, from documentary features and narrative features to experimental shorts and animated shorts.

    "description": "This panel discussion is a conversation between two authors who also share a teacher-student relationship. Nivedita Menon will speak on her latest book, Secularism as Misdirection, while Debangana Chatterjee, her student from Jawaharlal Nehru University, will present her first book, Lives of Circumcised and Veiled Women. The intellectual pursuits of two individuals, which converged in classroom discussions once, complete a full circle of knowledge creation. \nThe conversation aims to probe religion and secularism using gender as the focal point.\u00a0Menon\u2019s title alludes to perspectives from the global South and India. In her argument, secularism performs a \u201cmisdirection\u201d as in the performance of a magic trick.\u00a0It simultaneously hypervisiblises women and religion and obscures caste, capitalism, and the non-individuated, non-rational self.  Chatterjee\u2019s work sheds light on the politics of representation and the process of exoticising women\u2019s bodies in knowledge production; presenting the politics which cloaks the \u2018misdirection\u2019. It brings out the intricacies of representational discourses around cultural practices of female circumcision and Islamic veiling. \nThe conversation will be moderated by Rinku Lamba, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Kannada | 90 minutes | Suitable for Ages 16+\u00a0 \nThe play is an ode to queer love. It is a meditation on the values of empathy and dialogue as powerful agents to bring estranged minds together. The narrative traverses through moments of passion, anger, sadness, and love in its raw human element. The characters attempt to interrogate, understand, and acknowledge each other, and in this process, unveil the universality of all emotions as being the same, irrespective of gender and orientation. The play tries to deconstruct and lay open the psychological and emotional baggage of the characters who are but symbols of the divided humanity that we are today. An interfaith gay couple and the mother of one of the characters venture on a journey of understanding one another rather light-heartedly through uncomfortable conversations, only to explore depths which they never knew or imagined would be possible to unearth. \n\n\n\n\nPlaywright/Director\u2019s Note: \nWith the drastic change in the political discourse the world has witnessed in the last few years, one cannot but notice the drastic emergence of an undeniable divide within humanity. There are two segments that appear to be in stark contrast, constantly struggling and fighting with each other. There is a constant othering and exclusion of minorities by the majority in power. During the pandemic, the apathy by the political class at large was glaringly visible and we witnessed in full display the class disparity that envelops our nation. The Hindu \u2013 Muslim rhetoric was constantly fed to us through public discourse and hate was offered as a staple diet for even those who refused to be part of it. \nThe artist felt compelled to speak up, believing that love is the only antidote to the vehement poison of hate. They hence decided to write and direct this play that features the love story of a gay couple hailing from the Hindu and Muslim communities. Diversity cannot be celebrated without the intersectionality that makes for the complex mix of the society we are. The play intends to hold the mirror to the microaggressions and biases that consume us all through humor and emotional storytelling. \nWith music, love, and humor, the play tries to unravel the demons of Islamophobia and homophobia in us all. It celebrates the value of empathetic dialogue and honest communication in eradicating hate. Amma mattu Suhail is a tender story of love, acceptance, and possibilities. \nThe artist is a classical musician, writer, and theatre practitioner, and their arts practice is always an amalgamation of these elements. They create out of necessity! Having grown up queer and gender fluid, they struggled to find representation in the Kannada arts scene and were disappointed. They tried to fit in and adapt to the arts \u201cas is\u201d but eventually found it suffocating and had to carve out their own path and create what they wanted to engage with. They strive to bring marginalized voices to the fore and their stories or creations always aim to question and break patriarchal stereotypes and conditioning. Their search is always to find fluidity. Just like their characters either in the plays they have written or in the dance-based compositions they have created, which always traverse through the non-binary nature of gender identity or sexuality, the art they create yearns to find fluidity in form and content. They break the structure and form using non-linear narratives, democratic \u2013 secular emotional indulgences, and fluid emotional paradigms. They attempt to convey the grotesque bizarreness of our social existence with humor and the humorous, funny realities that define us through the macabre. \nThey always like to begin with an uncomfortable space and establish familiarity with the unfamiliar. Most importantly, they want their art to be accessible to all class and caste sections of society. They often find it very difficult to mold their form in a way that does not \u201cother\u201d an audience which has no access to learning arts appreciation or delving into abstraction. While they try to abstain from dumbing down their audience, they make it a priority to make their arts inclusive. Having been in circles where art is created and consumed in the same vicious elitist spaces and circles, they yearn to connect to a larger canvas. \nHaving written, produced, and directed three plays, their exploration has always yearned to find that fluidity between sound and silence, prose and poetry, body and realism. They aim to tell more queer stories which are embraced by the mainstream and more mainstream stories which make the queer community feel that they are \u201cseen\u201d. Whilst they are cognizant of the brutal grays that marginalized voices live in, they believe we need more positive representation of these marginalized characters. Their younger queer self wanted to watch happy endings and stories of hope and not just suicide and tragedies. They work only on stories which are fictional retellings of lived experiences and also for these stories to be specifically told in Kannada. Regional languages have the power to automatically place these stories in a certain space while also making sure to remove them from only English-speaking elite spaces. They strive to create work which opens itself to a more vulnerable audience who need to hear, get uncomfortable, and feel ignited towards a spirit of inquiry through these stories. \nThey will be glad if their art is also entertaining but they will never be okay if it is not activism. \nCredits: \nPlaywright \u2013 Direction \u2013 Music : Karthik Hebbar\nCast: Dr Seetha Kote, B V Shrunga, Arun D T\nLighting: M G Naveen\nProduction Manager: Murali Sreeram\nSubtitles Execution: Chethana Ramesh Srivatsa\nBackstage: Vishak Bharadwaj and Soumya Dixit\nProduced by Dheemahi Theatre \nDheemahi Theatre was born out of the need to create a safe space for new voices. We are a space for the \u201coutsiders\u201d. We have come together to tell stories that have been oppressed and suppressed in other majoritarian spaces. Empathy and humanity are the main focuses of all the work that we create. We as a team thrive on celebrating diversity and secular narratives by exploring and devising new techniques for facilitating these stories. We work around minimalist production setups and maximal internal processes. With a passion for storytelling that transcends boundaries, we strive to create a stage that reflects the kaleidoscope of human experiences. Our productions are more than performances; they are a canvas of shared narratives that resonate with the richness of our collective journey. We aspire to weave together tales that inspire, provoke thought, and unite us in the magic of the theatre. \nSupported by: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n",

Contractor\u2019s collection of photographs of Jazz musicians is now with the Smithsonian Museum. This exhibition features a selection from over 20,000 images taken over 60 years, many of which have not been previously exhibited. This retrospective reflects Navroze Contractor\u2019s empathetic gaze and his ability to capture the perfect photographic \u2018moment\u2019. The curators will be present at the opening. \nCelebrating Navroze Contractor | Auditorium | Friday, 5 July | 6:30 pm\nThe inauguration and walkthrough of the exhibition will be followed by the\u00a0Release of the book, Photography Strictly Prohibited.\u00a0Tributes by Sanjiv Shah, Arshia Sattar and Rajesh Nair will be followed by a screening of Jharu Katha (2010), a 64-minute documentary film photographed and directed by Navroze Contractor. \nJharu Katha | 64 mins | 2010 | Documentary\nDrawing on extensive fieldwork in remote corners of rural Rajasthan and the\u00a0by-lanes of Jodhpur city, this documentary film on the broom, directed by\u00a0Navroze Contractor, engages in conversation with a wide spectrum of broom-makers. Their struggle for livelihood is intersected with different stories\u00a0of the broom provided by women and ritual attendants of shrines, traders,\u00a0municipal sweepers and garbage collectors. Through the counterpoint of\u00a0their voices, the film covers wide ground in opening the contradictory values\u00a0and belief-systems of the broom. \nSteeped in the realities of caste, the broom is both a source of livelihood for\u00a0millions of people and the repository of traditional knowledge. Even so, it\u00a0stigmatises entire communities through its associations with pollution and\u00a0untouchability. Highlighting the humiliation and robust survival of India\u2019s\u00a0most downtrodden caste groups, whose hopes are at once catalyzed and\u00a0complicated by the politics of reservations, Jharu Katha works towards a\u00a0larger envisioning of waste in urban India. Bleak and terrifying, this vision\u00a0questions the endurance of the broom and its capacity to reinvent itself in a\u00a0ceaseless process of change \nCamera/ Direction: Navroze Contractor\nResearch/ Script: Rustom Bharucha\nEditor: Monisha Baldawa\nAssociate Director: Madan Meena\nProducer: Yugantar \n\u0926\u0941\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e | Duvidha | 82 mins | 1973 | Hindi with English Subtitles\nBased on a Rajasthani folktale retold by Vijayadan Detha, Duvidha is about a merchant\u2019s son, whose relationship with his young bride, Lachhi is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her, resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband. \nAt its core,\u00a0Duvidha\u00a0is a metaphysical exploration of love, desire, and the complexities of human relationships. The ghost\u2019s obsession with Lachhi and his subsequent impersonation of her husband raise profound questions about identity, fidelity, and the nature of love itself. The film invites the viewer to ponder the depths of human longing and the lengths to which one might go to satisfy that longing. \n",

Their interactions with Chudamani spark lively exchanges and moments of humour, enriching the theatrical experience. \nOne of the standout features of Ascharya Choodamani is its interactive nature, inviting the audience to become actively engaged in the unfolding story. With rhythmic and live songs interwoven throughout the performance, viewers are transported into a world where music and storytelling seamlessly blend, creating an immersive and memorable theatrical experience for all. \nDirector\u2019s Note: \nOver the past few years, I\u2019ve delved into the realm of Theatre in Education, recognising the profound impact theatre can have on both children and adults alike. \nIn today\u2019s fast-paced world, where digital distractions often take precedence over outdoor activities and meaningful social interactions, it\u2019s imperative that we make efforts to reconnect younger generations with the simple joys of life. Ascharya Choodamani serves as a poignant reminder of the beauty found in community, nature, and human connection. \nAs an initiative of the Indian Theatre Foundation (ITF), this production aims to bridge the gap between modernity and tradition, inviting audiences to rediscover the magic of storytelling and performance art. Through the collaborative efforts of young artists hailing from diverse regions and cultures, we bring to life the vibrant tapestry of Ascharya Choodamani, enriching it with their unique experiences, talents, and musicality. \nThis play is not merely entertainment; it\u2019s a celebration of cultural diversity and a testament to the power of unity. With its humorous and multilingual elements, Ascharya Choodamani promises to captivate audiences of all ages, inviting them on a journey of laughter, reflection, and wonder. \n \n\u00a0 \nWith Support from: \n \n\u00a0 \n",
