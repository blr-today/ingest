    "description": "What does the life of an ordinary working-class Indian look and feel like? \nJoin us for a panel discussion discussing this and more with the author of\u00a0The Many Lives of Syeda X Neha Dixit and commentator and editor Priya Ramani. \nIn her book The Many Lives of Syeda X\u00a0 journalist Neha Dixit traces the story of one such faceless Indian woman, Syeda X, from the early 1990s to the present day. What emerges is a picture of a life lived under constant corrosive tension. \nResearched for close to a decade, in this book, we meet an unforgettable cast of characters for whom\u00a0displacement, tragedy and hardships are the things they are used to. Written with empathy and deep insight, this book is a portal to a harsh world hidden away from elite Indians. It is the story of untold millions and a searing account of urban life in New India. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nPresented by:\n \n",

    "description": "What happens when we begin to realise that perhaps what we see isn\u2019t through clear eyes? \nWhat if we not just sense that many lenses exist in this world,\nBut also that each one of us has an endless supply of them. Lenses big and small\nLenses of all kinds\nDifferent lenses for different people\nDifferent lenses for different situations\nLenses Inspired by the learnings and un learnings of our individual and collective journeys. Lenses inspired by the biases and fears we wear as shields. \nAnd what happens when lenses begin to come off\nOne at a time? \nMeri Aenak Se is a journey a part of each one of us is on. A secret quest each human being is on, a quest of love, a quest for a world with that love\nSo one can surrender to it\nWe take these journeys while we travel on roads that are parallel to one another,\nas we live alongside each other\nBut we take these journeys in isolation.\n\nWhat would happen if suddenly, these journeys became aware of one another?\n\n\nAbout The Aahvaan Project \n\n\n\nThe journey of Aahvaan, a musical collective, has been nothing short of an odyssey. Beginning in late 2016, the past two years have been a watershed moment for the group, as they have traversed the length and breadth of the country, performing, conducting workshops, and enriching themselves through the experience. \nThroughout their tours, Aahvaan has continued to refine their musical style, fusing diverse genres and collaborating with like-minded artists to create a sound that they believe is a modern representation of Nirgun. This constant evolution has allowed them to connect with fellow travellers along the way, each encounter contributing to their artistic growth. \nAahvaan\u2019s latest presentation, \u201cMeri Aenak Se,\u201d is an exploration of the differences in perception, attitudes, and actions that shape our individual experiences. It invites the audience to step into the shoes of another, to see the world through their eyes, and to share in their joys and struggles as if they were one\u2019s own. \nThe original songs and stories, lovingly and thoughtfully curated by Vedi and Sumant, are a testament to Aahvaan\u2019s commitment to storytelling. They cherish the opportunity to share their journey with audiences, fostering a deeper understanding and connection between individuals and cultures. \nAahvaan\u2019s story is one of growth, exploration, and the power of music to bridge the gaps between us. Through their performances and workshops, they continue to inspire and captivate audiences, inviting them to embark on a journey of self-discovery and empathy. \n\u00a0 \nSupported by \n \n",

    "description": "This session\u00a0presents an enthralling journey through the rich history of the sitar, beginning with its origins and evolution across centuries. The performance explores the sitar\u2019s creation from natural elements, merging Persian and Indian musical traditions to symbolize its sacred and timeless nature. As the sitar travels through royal courts, it becomes a symbol of refinement and cultural prestige, before eventually establishing itself as a central instrument in Indian classical music. This concert highlights the transformation, showcasing the sitar\u2019s rise as a solo instrument and its deep connection to Indian music. \nHonoring the contributions of legendary sitarists like Ustad Vilayat Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar, this performance will illustrate their groundbreaking innovations that shaped the sitar\u2019s modern identity and global influence. From classical Indian ragas to cross-cultural experiments, the sitar\u2019s role in contemporary music will be explored, demonstrating its versatility and ongoing relevance in world music. Through a blend of storytelling and music, this performance celebrates the instrument\u2019s enduring legacy and its profound impact on both classical and global music. \nPresented by \n \n",

    "description": "Many years ago, in Detroit during a chance meeting with Jerry Murad of the Harmonicats, a commitment was made. Sulaiman Jamal met Jerry Murad at a harmonica convention, and he asked Sulaiman to continue playing the chromatic harmonica. He highlighted the versatility and beauty of the small instrument. That was Sulaiman\u2019s motivation and inspiration to continue playing the unique instrument which he had actually put in cold storage. \nWhile Jerry had passed away many years ago, Sulaiman was reminded by a mutual friend that he had not fulfilled Jerry\u2019s request \u2013 This concert is to do just that. \nThe theme of the concert is to cover some of the greatest Broadway and cinema themes, mainly from yesteryear which have warmed our hearts. \nThe evening will include favourites from Phantom of the Opera, The Wizard of Oz, Jesus Christ Superstar, Fiddler on the Roof and more. Not to forget the classics from The Beatles, Leonard Cohen, Simon and Garfunkel, and Big Band and Blues numbers. \nWith a group of extremely talented and accomplished musicians, the evening can\u2019t be anything but memorable.

    "description": "The foundation of Qawwali history in India, known as the Delhi Gharana, was laid by Hazrat Amir Khusro himself. Under his supervision, the Sangeet Qawwali Bachhe Sufi, also known as the Qawwal Bache Gharana music group, was formed. When Khusro came to Gulbarga in the Deccan region, the style of the Banda Nawaz brothers became prevalent and distinctive, rather than the traditional Qawwali. \nIn the Chishti school of thought, Qawwali holds a special place and is sometimes even accorded the status of worship. During this period, some Qawwali and music teachers of the Chishtiya lineage accompanied the Banda Nawaz brothers to the Deccan. These included the Banda Nawaz Nizami Sabri and other Banda Nawaz brothers known by various monikers. In Karnataka, they are referred to as Banda Nawaz Qawals. \nKarnatak Qawwali is one of the most popular musical styles in the Deccan, and its descendants continue to perform it. In Gulbarga Sharif, there is a branch of the Qawwali Brothers that is quite famous, known as the Banda Nawaz Brothers. This group includes Muhammad Tanveer Niazi, Salam Banda Nawaz, Khawaja Mian Banda Nawaz, and others. \nThe Sufi performers of Kalyana Karnataka are deeply connected with social alchemy, as they accompany every person, village, and Sufi of the region in public festivals and Urs celebrations, both large and small. These artists are truly public performers and can be considered ambassadors of Carnatic Sufi music in Kalyana Karnataka. The Banda Nawaz brothers\u2019 Qawwali is the custodian of this revived Sufi music, belonging to the same family and keeping the tradition alive through successive generations. \nThe beautiful and colourful compositions of Kalyana Karnataka are presented at various festivals, with their unique tone and ideas. The group has been awarded the prestigious Kalyana Karnataka Award. Their style of Qawwali, infused with local Sufism, is unique and reveals the influence of Sufi sages and their company. \nThe Qawwali tradition in Kalyana Karnataka is both a preserver and innovator of this ancient art form. The performers are skilled in choosing meaningful words and delivering them so the audience is inevitable moved and often in raptures . Their music does more than entertain \u2013 it offers spiritual fulfillment and teaches listeners about Sufi ideas and poetry. \nWhat makes this style special is how it blends different elements. It captures the heart of Sufi poetry while maintaining a classical feel. At the same time, it creates a unique sound by mixing broader Indian music styles with specific South Indian (Carnatic) traditions. \nThis combination of traditional roots and regional adaptation makes Kalyana Karnataka\u2019s Qawwali a rich and meaningful form of cultural expression. It speaks to people\u2019s hearts, minds, and souls, connecting them to both ancient wisdom and contemporary experiences. \nTo delve deeper into this rich history and cultural synthesis, scholars Rehmat Tarikere and Syed Rauf Qadri will provide expert insights. Professor Tarikere, known for his extensive research on Sufi traditions in Karnataka, will elucidate the historical context and evolution of Qawwali in the region. Dr. Qadri, an authority on poetry, Islamic mysticism and its musical expressions, will explore the spiritual dimensions and poetic nuances of the Kalyana Karnataka Qawwali tradition. Together, these scholars will offer a comprehensive understanding of the syncretic culture and musical traditions that have shaped Qawwali in the Deccan and Kalyana Karnataka regions. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Ardha \u2013 The Incomplete Dream is a solo work born out of a collection of essays contained in the book, Finding Radha by Namita Gokhale and Malashri Lal. Weaving together Bharatanatyam and spoken word, Ardha looks at Radha as the \u2018adhara\u2019 in whom the essence of Krishna is held. Beyond her oft-recognized status as Krishna\u2019s lover and his chosen gopi, Radha is \u2018Hladini Shakti\u2019 \u2013 the potency that is half of Krishna, their spirits engaged in perpetual \u2018Lila Hava\u2019- the exchange of ornaments, attire, and souls. \nCould Radha be an illusion that, through her dhara (flow) of joy and pain in union and separation, symbolizes the yearning for something beyond, a yearning that exists in every human? What happened to Radha after Krishna left Mathura? Why is Krishna celebrated while Radha, is a mere shadow in her aradhana to him? \nCredits:  \n\u2013 Concept, Choreography, Dance, Spoken word: Vidhya Subramanian \n\u2013 Music Composition: Shreya Devnath \n\u2013 Sound track produced at Resound India and mixed and mastered by Sai Shravanam \n\u2013 Musicians: Keerthana Vaidyanathan, Shreya Devnath, Sivaprasad, Sruti Sagar, Sai Shravanam, Manonmani, Vidhya Subramanian \nSupported by:\n \n",
