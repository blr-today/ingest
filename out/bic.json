    "description": "The Bengaluru Debates: A BIC\u2013Janaagraha Dialogue Series on Urban Governance in Bengaluru and Beyond aims to expand civic space in the city by fostering conversations through a civic lens. The series is designed to be informative, constructive, and entertaining, while also serving as a trigger for local community action. Its objective is to bridge the gap between policy, practice, and public discourse on urban governance challenges, and to catalyse citizen and policymaker engagement towards systemic solutions. \nThe inaugural session will examine: \u201cCan the GBG Act deliver for Bengaluru?\u201d. Enacted in 2025, the GBG Act is a landmark legislation intended to strengthen Bengaluru\u2019s governance. This session will assess whether the Act can deliver on its promise and what it means for the future of the city. \nThe programme will feature a city-systems assessment of the GBG Act, followed by a 45-minute panel discussion and an interactive audience Q&A. The panellists are Mr. V Ravichander, Civic Evangelist and member of the GBG Act Advisory Committee, Shri Tejasvi Surya MP \u2013 Bangalore South and Shri Rizwan Arshad MLA \u2013 Shivajinagar. Mr. Srikanth Viswanathan, CEO of Janaagraha, will moderate the discussion.\u00a0 \nThrough this series, BIC and Janaagraha seek to build a widely followed platform for civic dialogue, citizen awareness, and informed media narratives on urban issues. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nJanaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, founded in 2001 in Bengaluru, is dedicated to transforming the quality of life in India\u2019s cities and towns. Their mission is to strengthen the systems of urban governance so that cities can deliver clean, green, safe, and liveable environments for all citizens. For them, \u201cquality of life\u201d is not only about infrastructure and services, but equally about responsive institutions, citizen engagement, and transparent, data-driven governance. \n",

    "description": "Mahua, the flower of the forest, carries with it memory, resilience, and taste. Once central to community life, it is now being reclaimed as a symbol of pride, livelihood, and ecological care. \nWe begin with a screening of Mahua \u2013 Wild Dreams, Wild Harvest, a short documentary by Ganesh Tilgam and Priyanshu Raj (Green Hub Fellows). The film traces how ethical harvesting and community-led initiatives are bringing Mahua back into the heart of culture and economy. \nA panel discussion, Reviving Mahua: From Forest to Future, follows. Ecologists, writers, entrepreneurs, chefs, and community members open a many-sided conversation on Mahua\u2019s cultural, ecological, and culinary significance. \nThe evening closes with a Mahua Tasting, where the flower\u2019s delicate sweetness and earthy depth come alive in both savoury and sweet forms. Crafted in collaboration with chefs and food researchers, this tasting invites you to meet Mahua not just as a plant, but as an experience of flavour, memory, and possibility. \nA flower, a flavour, a memory: take Mahua with you in more ways than one. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "Hailed by CBC Music as one of Canada\u2019s finest young musicians, pianist\u00a0Tony Yike Yang\u00a0first captured international attention at just sixteen, when he became the youngest-ever laureate of the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. Since then, he has appeared in some of the world\u2019s leading concert halls, from Carnegie Hall and the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre to the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, performing with major orchestras including the Cleveland Orchestra, Warsaw Philharmonic, and Orchestre M\u00e9tropolitain. \nThis evening, he presents a programme that\u00a0traces a sweeping arc through the Romantic imagination. Scriabin\u2019s early Preludes, brimming with youthful lyricism and harmonic daring, open the program alongside his rarely heard Fantasy in B minor, a work of stormy passion and fleeting radiance. Liszt follows with two contrasting masterpieces: the intimate Sonetto 104 del Petrarca, an ardent setting of Petrarch\u2019s love poetry, and the dazzling Mephisto Waltz No. 1, a diabolical dance that has become one of Liszt\u2019s most iconic showpieces. The program culminates in Chopin\u2019s Sonata in B minor, a towering work of emotional breadth and architectural genius, blending drama, poetry, and virtuosity. Together, these works highlight the Romantic piano\u2019s full expressive range, from inward reflection to elemental fire, brought to life by Tony Yike Yang\u2019s artistry. \n \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences. Through this initiative, we collaborate with various venues, extending the reach of our events beyond our own space. These partnerships not only breathe life into our gatherings but also play a crucial role in cultivating an environment for the flourishing of arts and culture in the city. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Between Gandhi and Savarkar lies the story of India\u2019s unresolved future. \nThe future of India has long been caught between two irreconcilable visions. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar were not just men, but embodiments of two enduring ideologies: Hind Swaraj and Hindutva. Their contest was never merely personal; it was a struggle over what India could, and should, become. \nPartition was one gash on the body of the nation, its scars still visible. Can India afford new wounds? To even attempt an answer, we must return to the old antagonisms \u2013 between communities, yes, but also within Hindu society itself. Few rivalries have been as sharp, or as consequential, as that between Gandhi and Savarkar. \nBased on his new book, Hindutva and Hind Swaraj, this talk reflects on the unresolved gulf between Gandhi and Savarkar. Not as history, but as a question that remains open: can such differences ever be bridged, or are they the fault lines of India\u2019s future? \n",

    "description": "How do centuries-old verses find new life in rhythm and movement? \nKABIR is a Bharatanatyam production that brings the timeless poetry of Sant Kabir into conversation with dance. What makes this work unique is the seamless weaving of Kabir\u2019s Hindi verses into the expressive framework of Bharatanatyam, guided by the musical brilliance of Vidwan O. S. Arun. His evocative vocals create a living bridge between word and movement, allowing the spiritual depth of Kabir\u2019s poetry to bloom on stage. \nConceived and choreographed by Varsha Akhouri, alumna and former faculty of the Kalakshetra Foundation, the production embodies both tradition and innovation. With her students carrying forward the performance, the piece becomes not just a retelling of Kabir\u2019s verses but a passing on of artistic legacy. \nKabir\u2019s words question dogma, transcend boundaries, and call us to simplicity, love, and self-realisation. In this production, poetry and dance converge to reveal their continued resonance with our fragmented world. \nA performance for the divine within and without. \nCredits:\nMusic and Vocals:\u00a0O S Arun\nConcept and Choreography:\u00a0Varsha Akhouri\nTabla: Martin\nMridangam: Shivaprasad\nSitar: Kishore\nFlute: Hariprasad\nSound engineer: Rakesh\nJathi: Sheejith Krishna\nLights: Venkatesh Krishna \nDancers:\nAsika Sajeevan\nAarathi S Nair\nDevika AC\nJisma K.K\nRoopesh PP\nShobhit Shivhare\nSreelakshmi EB\nSreeshna KM\nSreerejini NS \nSupported by: \n \n",

From knowing nothing about wine, she embarked on a gruelling decade-long pursuit of the world\u2019s most respected wine qualification. It will also explore her rise as one of the most trusted and popular voices in the alcobev space, emphasising the importance of self-investment, ambition without a blueprint, and chasing success without shortcuts. \nIn this candid conversation, Sonal will reveal what it takes to build a market from scratch and to lead with vision when no roadmap exists. Drawing from years of entrepreneurship, leadership, and global experience, she will offer a rare perspective on creating impact and shaping an industry against the odds.

    "description": "At its heart, The Dark Hours of the Night is a story about girlhood under constraint, about how adolescence, desire, and freedom are shaped and stifled within the walls of a conservative household. \nRabia\u2019s journey, woven together with the lives of her friends and cousins, illuminates the subtle negotiations, unspoken rebellions, and fragile solidarities that mark women\u2019s coming-of-age in a patriarchal world. The novel opens a conversation about the everyday intimacies of restriction and resistance: the ache of thwarted desire, the bonds of friendship, the weight of silence, and the difficult balance between compromise and courage. It asks what it means to grow up when the future has already been decided, and whether education, love, or even small acts of defiance can shift those boundaries. \nIn this session, Subodh Sankar and Salma will reflect on these resonant themes, of gender, family, power, and the search for selfhood, that lie at the centre of The Dark Hours of the Night and across Salma\u2019s larger body of work.

    "description": "What does it take to dream beyond your time\u2014and make those dreams real? \nVikram Sarabhai, founder of India\u2019s space programme, imagined communication satellites that would educate people when even a modest rocket launch seemed audacious. He envisioned agricultural complexes powered by atomic energy, sea water turned drinkable, and a modern India fuelled by science and creativity. But Sarabhai was more than a scientist\u2014he co-founded the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, the National Institute of Design, the dance academy Darpana, and India\u2019s first textile research cooperative, ATIRA. He also ran a thriving pharmaceutical company and launched India\u2019s first market research organisation, ORG. \nAs India navigates its twenty-first century aspirations, this session revisits the humane, imaginative, yet pragmatic vision of a man who built enduring institutions. Drawing from Vikram Sarabhai: A Life, author Amrita Shah offers an intimate portrait of a multifaceted genius whose legacy continues to shape India\u2019s present and future. She will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey, exploring the many lives and lasting vision of this extraordinary builder of modern India. \nThe conversation will conclude with an audience Q&A. \n",

    "description": "What happens when institutions bend, freedoms collapse, and silence rules? India once knew. \nFive decades may have passed, but the Emergency remains a stark reminder of how swiftly freedoms can be curtailed. In those 21 months, prisons filled, the press was silenced, and democratic institutions bent under the weight of authoritarian rule. The questions it leaves behind are urgent: what does this episode tell us about the fragility of democracy, and what echoes of it persist today? \nA new volume gathers reflections from scholars, writers, historians, journalists, and activists to probe this turbulent chapter and its continuing relevance. Joining the discussion are Peter Ronald de Souza, co-editor of the book, historian Janaki Nair, sociologist Chandan Gowda, and political scientist Rinku Lamba, in a conversation moderated by Thomas Abraham.\u00a0 \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Can dance translate the restlessness of a conscience, the weight of compassion? \nWith Gandhi, choreographer C P Satyajit reimagines the Mahatma\u2019s life and philosophy through the timeless language of Bharatanatyam. This is not a chronological retelling, but a meditation on his ideals: his restless pursuit of truth, his unwavering sense of justice, his profound connection with people. \nThrough delicate abhinaya and layered rhythmic improvisations, the production traces Gandhi\u2019s journey as both a leader and a seeker. Informed by the research of Dr. V R Devika, whose PhD explored Gandhi\u2019s communication strategies, the work captures how his ideals might continue to move us, literally and metaphorically, today.\n\nIn this unique performance, every gesture is a reminder that truth and compassion remain unfinished tasks. \nCredits:\nConcept & Choreography:\u00a0C P Satyajit \nDancers:\nKeerthana Ganesan\nDevikha S\nHemavathy Kalaiarasan\nParvathi Parameswar\nArchana Sivasubramanian\nAnjannaa Ashok \nMusicians\nM S Sukhi: Rhythm\nMonali Bala: Voice\nManonmani T: Sarangi \nOriginal Lighting Design: Martin Jose\nOperated by: Muthukumar R \nThe production is created by Bharata Kalanjali with the support of the Kaladham Trust and Sarvodaya International, Karnataka. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n\u00a0 \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "The ancient Indian Panchanga, or Hindu calendar, is a remarkable synthesis of astronomy, mathematics, and cultural tradition. This unique event brings it alive using modern Stellarium astronomy software, where celestial movements will be visualised through simple planetary animations. \nParticipants will learn the meaning of terms like\u00a0Masa, Paksha, Tithi, and Nakshatra, and discover why our festivals shift dates each year, why months have 30 or 31 days, why there are 12 zodiac signs, and why exactly 27 nakshatras govern the skies. These everyday questions find their answers in the ingenious design of the Panchanga. \nThe session also highlights the rich heritage of the Hindu school of astronomy. Flourishing for over 1,500 years and reaching a peak during the Vijayanagar period, with Kerala as its vibrant epicenter, this tradition produced profound insights into planetary motion and time. The ancient text\u00a0Surya Siddhanta\u00a0went even further, defining multiple scales of time\u2014from a human day (sunrise to sunrise), to a day of the Pitrs (a lunar month), to a day of the gods (a solar year). It even stretched the imagination to the grand cosmic cycles of\u00a0parardha\u2014155.52 trillion years\u2014down to the fleeting span of\u00a0prana, a few seconds. \nBy blending science with storytelling, speaker\u00a0S. Kishore Kumar\u00a0will reveal how the Hindu calendar is not just a tool for marking festivals, but a timeless scientific framework that connects human life to the rhythms of the cosmos. \nIn collaboration with:\n   \n",

Odissi, by contrast, is shaped through defined stances and sculpted transitions, where each turn of the body becomes an offering of story and song. \nThis performance brings together two women dancers in the Odissi\u2013Manipuri conversation, setting two vocabularies side by side: one fluid and veiled, the other precise and chiselled. \nThe second in a two-part Odissi\u2013Manipuri dialogue, this evening unfolds through the feminine body, following last month\u2019s exploration by two male dancers. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",
