    "description": "The mandate of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections was claimed as a victory by both the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). Even though BJP\u2019s brute majority in the Lok Sabha was dented, the return of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a third consecutive term was portrayed as a stupendous victory by supporters of the BJP. This is notwithstanding the fact that the stability of the NDA government is now dependent on allies who have displayed temperamental behaviour in the past. The INDIA Alliance was also buoyed by the mandate as it increased its numbers substantially. The Indian National Congress, the leading component of the INDIA bloc, almost doubled its numbers, while other key constituents of this disparate coalition robustly challenged the might of the BJP election apparatus. Even though the INDIA bloc could not gain power in Delhi, its combative fight against the BJP/ NDA was lauded because \u2013 as many astute observers pointed out \u2013 the 2024 elections were not seen as a level playing ground. \nStarting from this point, Yogendra Yadav and Dr. Vasu HV will discuss some of the implications of this mandate on the future of India. While Yadav, who is a well-known political and social activist, travelled all over the country tracking the election and even accurately called it, Dr. Vasu played a similar role in Karnataka leading the research on pre-poll surveys that broadly captured the sentiments of the people of the State. Thus, the two panelists will provide their crucial insights based on their deep and credible engagement with political behaviour at the national and state level. \nCritics of the BJP have sharply and consistently stated that the idea of India has been imperilled in the past 10 years when the saffron party, buttressed by its parliamentary heft, meddled with the institutional framework weakening the republican foundations on which our country was founded. Will the gain in the numbers by the political opposition mean that the political discourse in the country, that had discernibly shifted rightwards over the past decade, gradually be tugged back to a central pole position that perhaps, more accurately reflects the civilizational ethos of a diverse and complex country like India? Early signs indicate that the political opposition has been catalysed by the mandate and is rearing to take the BJP/ NDA head on but how will these diverse political actors maintain their cohesion considering that a slew of state elections will take place where they will be pitted against one another? \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Psephologist and Activist, Yogendra Yadav and Journalist, Dr. Vasu HV will be in conversation with Journalist, Vikhar Ahmed. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in July 2024. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!

    "description": "Where does our fabric come from? What transforms a ball of cotton into the comfortable clothes we wear? In our fast-paced, consumerist society, many of us are unaware of the origins of our clothing. While we buy a lot of clothes, the weavers behind them often earn meager sums for their labor and effort. Consumers frequently spend large amounts on what they believe to be handloom and handspun fabrics, but they often lack the means to verify the authenticity of their purchases. Much of the handloom fabric available in the market is made from mill-spun yarn containing polyester and viscose. \nFor urban spinners, spinning yarn is therapeutic. It disconnects us from our devices and connects us to something tangible. Spinning is meditative and accessible to people of all ages (8 years and up). It promotes slow, sustainable living and supports an equitable ecosystem for handloom weavers, tailors, and fabric dyers. \nThe aim of this session is to raise awareness about yarn spinning and demonstrate the transformation of cotton into yarn for fabric making. The session will include a\u00a012-minute video on the context of the craft, demonstrations of spinning using the Peti Charkha, demonstrations of spinning using the Gandhi Charkha and much more! \n",

    "description": "Violinists Trina Basu and Arun Ramamurthy present their debut album, Nakshatra. This lush and spiritual collaboration bridges traditions and defies genres, blending South Indian classical music, Western chamber music, and jazz improvisation. The album\u2019s title, a Sanskrit word for constellations and interconnectedness, encapsulates its expansive sound, created by two violins in sublime harmony. \nNakshatra\u00a0is a cinematic work that conveys a sense of two souls conversing across centuries. Rooted in diverse musical traditions, Trina and Arun reimagine the potential of string chamber music with a unique sound described by The New Yorker as \u201cfree-flowing and globe-spanning,\u201d and by The Guardian as resonating \u201cwith the power of an ancient drone, revivified by a fearless, contemporary spirit.\u201d This album, five years in the making, is a testament to the duo\u2019s fluency in improvisation, offering a deeply intimate yet grand musical experience. Join us for an evening that promises to be both introspective and expansive, celebrating the intricate interplay of two violinists. \nSupported by: \n \n",

This was puzzling since elephants were present on other Indian Ocean islands like Sumatra, Borneo, and Sri Lanka, which share a similar geological history and were accessible from the continent during the Pleistocene glaciations. Adding to the mystery, the Andamans are home to primitive tribes who likely reached the islands by land during the last Ice Age. So, why were elephants absent? \nIronically, starting in 1858, the British colonial administration imported elephants by ship from Burma and India to the Andamans for use in the timber extraction industry, where these animals were essential. During the 20th century, some of these elephants escaped or were abandoned, finding refuge on deserted islands where they returned to the wild. This phenomenon is unique in the history of the species, which is otherwise suffering from habitat loss across Asia. \nHow did these elephants reach the islands? Did they swim across the sea as commonly believed? This film investigates the enigmatic history of the Andaman elephants. \nA screening of the documentary will be followed by a conversation with the Directors,\u00a0Philippe Gautier & Prajna Chowta and a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "What went wrong with capitalism? Ruchir Sharma\u2019s account is not like any you will have heard before. He says progressives are right, in part, when they mock modern capitalism as \u201csocialism for the rich.\u201d For a century, governments have expanded in just about every measurable dimension, from spending to regulation and the scale of financial rescues when the economy wobbles. The result is expensive state guarantees for everyone\u2014bailouts for the rich, entitlements for the middle class, welfare for the poor. \nTaking you back to the 19th century, Sharma shows how completely the reflexes of government have changed: from hands-off to hands-on, from doing too little to help anyone in hard times to today trying to prevent anyone suffering any economic pain, ever. Trading sins of omission and indifference for excesses of spending and meddling, governments from the United States to Europe and Japan have pumped so much money into their economies that financial markets can no longer invest all that capital efficiently. \nInadvertently, they have fueled the rise of monopolies, \u201czombie\u201d firms, and billionaires. They have made capitalism less fair and less efficient, which is slowing economic growth and fueling popular anger. The first step to a cure is a correct diagnose of the problem. Capitalism has been badly distorted by constant government intervention and the relentless spread of a bailout culture. Building an even bigger state will only double down on what ruined capitalism in the first place. \nThe author, Ruchir Sharma, will be in conversation with\u00a0Chairman and Co-founder, Infosys and Founding Chairman\u00a0UIDAI\u00a0(Aadhaar), Nandan Nilekani. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "105 years ago, on April 13, 1919, British troops, under the command of General Reginald Dyer, opened fire on a crowd of unarmed Indians who had assembled in Jallianwala Bagh in Punjab. Over a thousand people were killed and wounded during the massacre but 22-year old Nanak Singh miraculously survived and wrote Khooni Vaisakhi, a searing ballad with twenty-four poems providing a remarkable chronological account of events during the first fortnight of April 1919. \nFormer Ambassador Navdeep Suri, the grandson of the legendary Punjabi poet Nanak Singh, along with songwriter and musician Harpreet, will perform pieces from their musical album based on Nanak Singh\u2019s Khooni Vaisakhi. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "In our history, infectious diseases have had and continue to have devastating consequences.\u00a0 The extension of the human lifespan in the 20th century came from our ability to control the scourges of the past, smallpox, tuberculosis, plague and malaria through safer water and sanitation, drugs and vaccines. Science transformed society, but with climate change, new threats can and will emerge. From data and modelling to emerging technologies, as the world\u2019s most populous country, India needs to be prepared for its people and the world. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Demonised as he was after his death, the reign of King Ravana of Lanka, and his ancestors, the powerful Mayuranga, has long been obscured and shrouded in myth. Their kingdom is believed to have reached beyond the shores of the island, once, capturing lands across the seas. A kingdom of such magnitude was never seen again on Lanka. \nIn a bid to shed light on this lost era, Sunela Jayewardene travelled through Sri Lanka, and listened to the storytellers and poets, researched Sri Lanka\u2019s folklore, sifted through race and religion, to stitch together a history of a forgotten landscape. \nThe story of the kingdom that\u00a0Ravana\u00a0had ruled lay over the island like a fading, antique map. The edges of the story were frayed and there were lines disconnected by time, but the landscape it traced, exists. Ravana\u2019s Lanka: The Landscape of a Lost Kingdom, written by Sunela Jayewardene is the story she learnt of King Ravana and the kingdom that he lost. \nIn this session, Sunela will be in conversation with Theatre Practitioner, Anuradha Venkataraman. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

The music and art will be accompanied by Dr. Basavaraj Sabarad\u2019s commentary which will provide a rich tapestry of context, driving home the historical and cultural significance of these ancient verses. \nAs the performance unfolds, the boundaries between art forms blur and the beauty of the Vachanas shines through. Through this innovative presentation, the trio invites the audience to experience the transformative power of art and literature, and to discover new dimensions of meaning\u00a0and\u00a0connection. \nSupported by: \n \n",
