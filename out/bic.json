    "description": "A tool is only as good as the hands that wield it. \nAnd AI is, after all, another tool. \nThis talk explores how Artificial Intelligence functions as a collaborator for creativity: accelerating exploration, provoking new directions, and sharpening creative judgment. The session opens with live demonstrations that surface instinctive reactions to AI-generated content, then lifts the veil on how these systems actually work and why their outputs can feel genuinely creative. No jargon, just clarity on what\u2019s happening under the hood and why it\u2019s more interesting than you might expect. \nA live co-creation segment puts theory into practice. Using tools like ChatGPT, Suno, and Midjourney, the session demonstrates real creative workflows in action. You\u2019ll discover that the power lives in iteration, selection, and rejection, revealing how human judgment shapes everything that emerges from these systems. \nAI represents the next generation of creative tools, shifting how creation happens, not why it happens. Intent remains yours. Taste remains yours. Meaning remains yours. The talk concludes by exploring the questions that make this moment genuinely intriguing: authorship, originality, bias, ethics. As AI makes output abundant and accessible, your context, lived experience, and values determine what\u2019s worth making in the first place. \n",

    "description": "Born from a vision to unite masters and experimentalists on a single stage, Prav\u0101ha debuted in 2024. The second edition of this festival, The Body As Space, explores how we experience the world through sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. \nOver eight days, the festival becomes a journey through sensation. Classical melodies meet olfactory landscapes. Contemporary dance transforms into tactile dialogue. Installations immerse you in sound, scent, and memory itself. Conversations uncover India\u2019s forgotten sensory archives and trace the origins of instruments that changed how we listen. \nWe invite you to tune into what you\u2019ve always carried: the intelligence of your body, the stories held in your senses. \nFestival Schedule: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\nArtist\nNature\nTimings\n\n\nFeb 22 \u2013 Mar 1\nHistories of Indian Perfume\nOn a Scented Trail\nThe Marg Foundation\nExhibition\n11am \u2013 8pm\n\n\nFeb 22 \u2013 Mar 1\nFirst-Hand\nA Multisensorial Pause for Rest, Attention, and Care\nNitish Jain\nPaticipatory Immersive Experience\nFeb 22 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 23 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 24 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 25 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 26 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 27 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 28 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\nMar 1 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nV\u0101san\u00e9\nOlfactory Archives of Bangalore\nIndu Antony\nLecture Demonstration\n11:30am \u2013 1pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nTHOL\nReconstructing Tamil Antiquity Through Instruments and Contemporary Songwriting\nUrupaanar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 23\nCall of the Flute\nA Coming Together of Pichwai Paintings, Kuchipudi and Music\nAmrita Lahiri, Shan Bhatnagar & Hrishikesh Majumdar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 24\nNotes That Linger\nSounds and Scents Mingling in the Evening Air\nKarl Lutchmayer\nImmersive Performance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 25\nThe Far Post\nPhysical Theatre With Masks, Puppetry and Music\nYuki Ellias, Tapas Boro, Priyanshu Gupta, Sumaiya Merchant, Mati Rajput, Arnob Bal & Asmit Pathare\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 26\nNavrasa and I\nReliving the Rasas through Raagas\nIndrayudh Majumdar & Roopak Kallurkar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 9pm\n\n\nFeb 27\nA Woman Or Not to Be\nA Bold Reimagining of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet Through the Eyes of a Woman\nAdishakti Laboratory for Theatre Art Research\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nThe Percussive Pathway\nA Brief Foray into the Wondrous World of Percussion\nRahul Vanamali\nInteractive Performance & Workshop\n11am\n12:30pm\n2:30pm\n4:30pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nKadahin Milandaasin | \u06aa\u068f\u0647\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646\nA Jazz Quartet Weaving Memory into Music\nTarun Balani, Sonja Ott, Siddharth Gautam & Luke Marantz\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nMar 1\nFuture Food Taste Test\nWhat\u2019s in Our Climate Pantry?\nEdible Issues\nWorkshop\n4pm \u2013 6pm\n\n\nMar 1\nAbhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam: The Circle of Love\nA K\u016b\u1e6diy\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dam Performance Where Love Blossoms\nNepathya\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 9pm\n\n\n\nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "You know this story. \nA death in the royal family. A ghost with demands. A protagonist tipping toward madness, or something that looks like it. Revenge as the only logical conclusion. \nPut a woman in the centre. The axis shifts. \nDoes the ghost get believed? Does the grief get room, or a diagnosis? And what happens when the ghost doesn\u2019t ask for revenge at all, but tells her daughter to protect herself through education? \nPrincess Hamlet is twenty, home from college, fluent in manga and martial arts, and entirely unprepared for what her mother\u2019s ghost is asking of her. Adishakti\u2019s production departs sharply from Shakespeare, and in that departure, asks what we\u2019ve always taken for granted about grief, power, and who gets to act on either. \nWritten, adapted and directed by Vinay Kumar. Nimmy Raphel plays a Hamlet the original never imagined. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

    "description": "Krishna\u2019s flute has been stopping the world for centuries. \nGopis mid-chore. Lotuses mid-bloom. Cows mid-graze. Everything bends toward that sound. \nShan Bhatnagar\u2019s hand moves across cloth, Krishna taking form as the painting grows. Amrita Lahiri becomes the story, Kuchipudi\u2019s precise geometry turning devotion into movement. Hrishikesh Majumdar plays the flute that started it all. \nPichwai is stillness, detail, meditation. Kuchipudi is energy, expression, the body as instrument. One from Nathadwara\u2019s havelis, one from Andhra\u2019s temple courtyards. A thousand kilometres between them, the same longing underneath. \nIt begins with the flute, then the painting blooms, and the dance answers. \nSomewhere in the space between sound, movement, and image, devotion becomes tangible. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

    "description": "A performance of Western classical music. But not quite your traditional piano recital. \nThe pieces are famous. Debussy, Scarlatti, Liszt, Grieg, Brahms, Sorabji, Copland. You may have heard some of them before. That is the point. Repetition does not preserve meaning, it changes it. The same notes, heard again, evoke different emotions. \nEach piece arrives with a scent. The music reaches you through the ear. The fragrance reaches you somewhere you can\u2019t quite name. Between the two, something surfaces: the specific, vivid kind of memory that belongs only to you. \nWoven through is a conversation about music, scent and sensation: how memory is invoked without words, without warning, without intention. \nThe piano is waiting. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

    "description": "Your brain is doing something incredible right now. \nJust by reading this, you\u2019re taking in information, making connections, and building a picture of the world, without even trying. But what if you could understand how that works? \nIn this workshop, we get into the science and philosophy behind learning itself. How do your senses shape what you believe? Why do two people experience the same moment completely differently? And what does that mean for how you see, and question, everything around you? \nThrough sharp discussion and some genuinely surprising ideas, you\u2019ll leave thinking about your own mind in a way you never have before. \n\nAround the World in 50 Sundays\u00a0is a journey that begins, not with a ticket, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \n\nSupported by:\n\n",

    "description": "Nobody said the afterlife would be fair. \nTwo enemy soldiers die in battle and find themselves at the same border crossing into the afterlife. The officer in charge is a Postman Aunty with a pet goldfish and a makeshift post office that serves both sides of the conflict equally. As the soldiers navigate what comes next, letters from the war begin to surface. Masks shift, puppets move, bodies speak. \nDirector Yuki Ellias built a show without words, letting movement do the work. Sofiyum, a Sikkimese band, fills the stage with music that weaves Lepcha folk traditions into something entirely its own. The songs, created in Lepcha with the Dur See Brothers, give the show a sound world as specific and ethereal as its setting. \nCold mountains. A border cutting through no man\u2019s land. A goldfish.

    "description": "\nOne diplomat. Four decades. An entire world in upheaval. \nFrom the dying days of the Soviet Union to the streets of Burma, from a kingdom being absorbed into India to the two Germanys becoming one, this memoir traces an extraordinary career lived at the fault lines of history. \nWritten by a former Indian diplomat, the book moves across the Soviet Union, Sikkim, Burma, South Korea, Germany, Ukraine and Indonesia, charting four decades of geopolitical transformation through the eyes of someone who was there. Not in the briefing rooms of power, but on the ground, watching, listening, and recording what ordinary people wanted for their lives: freedom, openness, dignity. \nRunning through it all is a quieter story, of India itself, navigating a turbulent world as a non-aligned nation, finding its footing politically and economically while the old order collapsed around it. \nThis is history as it was lived. Up close, and impossible to look away from. \n\n",

    "description": "You\u2019ve received the call. The scam artist trying to get your information. Perhaps you fell for it, perhaps you knew better. In either case, it becomes a story to tell over coffee. \nBut who are the people on the other end of line? \nIn her new book, Scamlands, journalist\u00a0Snidha Poonam explores\u00a0the vast fraud economies stretching from small-town India to global scam hubs.\u00a0Nuanced, detailed and above all, personal, Poonam reports on the many lives that run parallel to our own.\u00a0Tracing the supply chains of fraud, she reveals an economy that\u2019s both ruthlessly efficient and heartbreakingly human. \nIn this talk, she is joined by columnist Aakar Patel to explore the themes of the book. They will examine how scam economies thrive in the gaps of inequality, why trust is collapsing faster than we can rebuild it, and what it means when fraud becomes a viable career path for an entire generation. The session ends with an audience Q&A. \nThere are no easy answers, but you\u2019ll know more when that unknown number calls again. \n",

He travelled through India\u2019s football heartlands, from the hills of the northeast to the coasts of Kerala to the flatlands of Bengal, searching for the game beneath the game. He mapped our country through its football culture in his book,\u00a0Sacred Grounds: The Journey Through People\u2019s Football in India. \nIn this talk, Sandeep brings\u00a0those stories to life. The local heroes nobody outside their village has heard of. The formats (Sevens, Khep, Basti tournaments) that have their own rules, their own rituals, their own worlds. The communities for whom football isn\u2019t a sport so much as a language. \nThis is football as identity, as belonging, as something worth fighting to keep alive. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A.

    "description": "Have you ever heard a kudamuzha? The five-faced drum disappeared centuries ago. As did the yaazh harp, the urumi, the parai. Instruments that once shaped Tamil ritual soundscapes, gone silent. \nUrupaanar brought them back. \nTHOL\u00a0is their debut album, the world\u2019s first recorded entirely on the yaazh. It\u2019s also a live performance, a sonic excavation of Tamil antiquity where music becomes a site of memory and landscape. Drawing from Sangam-era traditions, the eight-piece collective uses reconstructed ancient instruments to create sound that is both archival and immediate. \nThe performance follows the thinai system from Tolk\u0101ppiyam, which understands emotion as inseparable from environment. Mountains, forests, farmlands, seashores, arid regions: each landscape gives rise to distinct emotional states and rhythms. Feeling is shaped by climate, terrain, flora, sound, movement. Music emerges from ecology, carrying the textures of place and the sensorial conditions of lived life. \nNinety minutes of ancient sonic ecosystems reactivated in contemporary performance. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

That moment of surrender? That\u2019s the real mountain. \nIn this multimedia talk based on their new book,\u00a0What\u2019s Your Everest? (Bloomsbury), Samir and Sauraj strip the heroism from the world\u2019s highest peak. Through expedition films, fireside conversation, and an open Q&A, they unpack the unglamorous truth behind the glory of the summit: frostbitten hands at 8,000 meters, relief work after tragedy, and the brutal discipline of trying again. This is about failure, leadership, ego, and the invisible mountains we all face: ambition, burnout, fear, and the gap between wanting something and the willingness to suffer for it. \nWhat\u2019s your Everest?

    "description": "A single family. A small village. An entire nation\u2019s story hiding inside. \nTell Me A Story About Our World brings together academic and translator Vanamala Viswanatha and novelist Kavery Nambisan for a conversation about the art of fiction and storytelling, based on Nambisan\u2019s latest novel, Rising Sons. Set in a village in Karnataka, following one family from pre-independent India through to the 1970s, threading through the complexities of caste and colonialism while painting vivid landscapes of rural and urban life in a bygone era. \nWhat makes Rising Sons sing is how Nambisan inhabits her world. Kannada coexists comfortably within the English, not as a novelty but as a force of realism, enabling the reader\u2019s sensibility to percolate through society at every level. Then there is the narrator: never formally introduced, yet unmistakably present, speaking of \u201cour village\u201d and \u201cour daily lives\u201d with a voice that is not quite impartial. The resulting text reads as both narration and remembrance, an immersion into a carefully crafted world. \nThe stories we tell are as much about the Word as they are about the World. Expect an interesting and illuminating conversation, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n",

Damage transforms into something worth keeping. \nRed House brings this meditative practice to Bangalore after reaching over 20,000 participants across India. Their space in Okhla is itself a product of this philosophy: once an abandoned factory, it was converted into a thriving cultural hub in 2022. Now one of Delhi\u2019s pioneering hubs for this ancient art, Red House invites you to experience the ritual firsthand. \nThe process is simple but deliberate. Select a ceramic piece, break it with intention using a hammer, then carefully mend it, watching as golden seams emerge where cracks once lived. Traditional Kintsugi uses lacquer and gold powder in a painstaking, multi-step technique that can take weeks. This workshop offers a more accessible approach, allowing you to complete the full arc of breaking and repair in a single session. You\u2019ll leave with a vessel wearing its history openly, a reminder that our fractures, when tended to, can become the most beautiful part of us. \nAn act of creation that insists our faults and repairs are worth displaying. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Bangalore smells. \nJasmine at dawn, petrol in traffic, filter coffee and wet earth after the first rain, incense curling through temple courtyards, garbage fermenting in afternoon heat. We live inside this rich olfactory landscape, but rarely pause to notice it. \nIndu Antony, however, has been mapping it for years. \nIn this 90-minute lecture-demonstration, Antony presents findings from V\u0101san\u00e9, Bangalore\u2019s first smell archive. Part urban anthropology, part sensory memoir, the work traces how scent carries memory, class, labour, and belonging in ways the visual record cannot. Smell resists documentation. It\u2019s intimate, fleeting, impossible to photograph. Which makes it a different kind of archive entirely. \nAntony walks you through her practice of mapping the city with her nose. The streets, markets, lakes, and corners where Bangalore announces itself before you see it. How smell marks territory, signals change, and holds what we\u2019ve lost. The lecture weaves fieldwork, personal narrative, and reflection on what it means to archive something so fugitive. \nThe session closes with a guided encounter: select scent-notes from the city, experienced in silence. An invitation to notice how your body remembers place beyond images and language. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year\u2019s festival is built around what we hear, smell, touch, taste, and see.
