    "description": "Nirvrithi is a state of inexplicable ecstasy. \nThrough the medium of Bharatanatyam, Shijith N Parvathy takes you on a journey in pursuit of this eternal bliss, the ultimate experience.\u00a0In Bharatanatyam, the Margam is a path that unravels a seeking. Through this path the dancer attains Nirvrithi. \nThe concept of Satchitananda described in the central piece of the performance is what\u00a0Shijith N Parvathy through their conceptual choreographic Margam takes you to experience. Nirvrithi is woven from manifested inner thoughts to stimulate the body, mind and soul. \nFor Shijith N Parvathy, Bharatanatyam is a spiritual recourse and Nirvrithi is their experience. \nThis is the fourth edition of the \u2018All For Dance\u2019 series presented by Kalavaahini in association with BIC curated by Malavika Sarukkai.

This talk will feature in-depth analysis of short films and excerpts from longer essay films in different genres that include actuality, observational documentary, found-footage film and autobiography, to look at the complex ways in which film\u2019s formal elements come together to create meaning while drawing on our lived experience. \nDay 2\n24 August | Saturday \n10:30 am\nScreening: Night and Fog\nAlain Resnais | 1956 | 32 mins\nThis poignant and harrowing documentary reflects on the horrors of Nazi concentration camps, blending historical footage with contemporary observations to evoke the stark reality of genocide and the importance of remembering its lessons. \nScreening: La Jet\u00e9e\nChris Marker | 1962 | 28 mins\nIn a post-apocalyptic future, a man is sent back in time to explore the past and find a way to save humanity, but his journey leads him to an unexpected and haunting conclusion. This innovative sci-fi short film is told almost entirely through still photographs.\n \n12:15 pm\nDigital Afterlives of Films\nTalks by\u00a0Chlo\u00e9 Galibert-La\u00een\u00e9 and\u00a0Ritika Kaushik\nChlo\u00e9 Galibert-La\u00een\u00e9:\u00a0In this deeply personal video diary, a young researcher tries to make sense of her fascination for the film \u201cThe Pain of Others\u201d by Penny Lane. A deep dive into the discomforting world of YouTube and online conspiracies, that challenges traditional notions of what documentary cinema is or should be.\nRitika Kaushik:\u00a0Ritika Kaushik will consider the video essay as a form for examining the digital afterlives of films from the past. Kaushik\u2019s talk will take us through her formal experiments with online and desktop interactions and how they can enliven archival and contemporary digital materials to bring out new configurations of film historiography. She will specifically discuss the \u2018reaction video\u2019 as an essayistic technique for creating an embodied and affective engagement with pre-existing audiovisual media. \n2:30 pm\nThe making of an Essay Film \u2013 Impetus and Discovery\nA Talk by Sameera Jain\nStemming from a practitioner\u2019s perspective, the session looks at some recent short films and traces their journeys of making. We find that the form appears through a search for a relationship with image, sound, time, meaning and affect, a pursuit that is not governed by existing formulations, but by the creative processes in practice. The talk will attempt to unpack phases in these navigations and present how the cinema essay is \u2018found\u2019, reflecting on the openness, expanse, fluidity and inclusivity of the form. In addition, referencing contemporary and historical cinema, we explore facets of the essay film, walking through with some examples. \n4:30 pm\nScreening: Films from the Creative Documentary Course, SACAC, New Delhi\n\u2022 I Am Yet to See Delhi by Humaira Bilkis | 2014 | 19 mins\n\u2022 Jamnapaar by Abhinava Bhattacharyya | 2017 | 24 mins\n\u2022 Chadariya by Nimisha Srivastava | 2022 | 25 mins \n6:30 pm\nScreening:\u00a0Tales from Planet Kolkata\nRuchir Joshi | 1993 | 38 mins\nTales from Planet Kolkata anticipates the period Calcutta was approaching in the early 90s: the wasteland of violent traffic, the orgy of rampant construction, the severing of old traditions, the rise of cynical politics, the strange, once again subservient relationship with the west. Seeing it today, it\u2019s startling how much of it still resonates with the city Calcutta/Kolkata has become. Part fiction, part spoof, part essay, part documentary, the film weaves together disparate strands: a critique of Western media\u2019s construction, from the 1960s to the 1990s; of Calcutta as \u2018the black hole\u2019 and \u2018the worst place in the world\u2019; an \u2018elegy\u2019 to Deepak Majumdar, one of\u00a0 Calcutta\u2019s great intellectual mavericks, a teacher and friend to Joshi and many others, who died while the film was being made; and the images and song of a patua \u2013 a traditional Bengali scroll-painter. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with the director, Ruchir Joshi. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nDay 3\n25 August | Sunday \n10:30 am\nScreening: Looking for Horses\nStefan Pavlovic | 2021 | 88 mins\nTravelling to Bosnia in search of his origins, filmmaker Stefan Pavlovic\u0301 meets a solitary fisherman. One man has language impairment, the other lost his hearing during the war. Camera in hand, the director films the onset of this improbable and profound friendship. \n12:15 pm\nEat your Mother and Father\nA Talk by Yashaswini Raghunandan\nIn this session we will look at how filmmakers weave in their families and themselves to expand the conversations around identity, alienation and political histories. Through the films \u2018Looking for Horses\u2019 by Stefan Pavlovic, \u2018Will you look at me?\u2019 by Shuli Huang and \u2018A picture of you\u2019 by Ajay Naronha, we will look at how the essay is constructed through the making of the film, revealing an intimate side of filmmaking. All three filmmakers use filmmaking as a method to ask difficult questions and to re-connect, allowing for some form of catharsis. \n2:30 pm\nEssay Film and the Voice\nA Talk by Matthew Barrington\nIn this session we explore the complexities of voice as both a narrative device and a vehicle for personal expression, as we examine its transformative power in shaping cinematic discourse. From subjective introspection to objective analysis, we unpack how the voice navigates the intricate intersections of truth, perspective, and interpretation within the essay film landscape. The voice as subjective \u2013 departing from a dominant, authoritative narrator. \n4:30 pm\nNon-Narratives with Conceptual Extensions\nA Talk by Vasanthi Mariadass\nVisual essays are noted for non-narrative style. A re-editing to re-narrate stories untold or less told. I engage with works by Ursula Biemann, and Harun Farocki, to examine their theoretical insertions through the visual form.\u00a0 I would not just call them visual essays but an unfolding of visual theory.\u00a0 Images collide or they are quietly juxtaposed, despite the events and topics coming from different spaces, times, and seemingly unrelated topics/images, hence refreshing found images and concepts. Conceptual works by Biemann relate to Environmental concerns and Farocki\u2019s concept examines an already established idea such as the enlightenment but rethinks and retells other not-so-visible concepts such as perfection and precision that silently negotiate the development of scientific and technological production. \n6:30 pm\nScreening:\u00a0Night and Fear (Raati O Bhaya)\nLipika Singh Darai | 2023 | 28 mins\nThe residuals of recorded material generated by the filmmaker over a decade of filmmaking practice, with the passing of time, have acquired new meaning. With a range of experiences \u2013 from a local witch hunt to a meeting with a stunning waterfall \u2013 the past, the present, the fear and the intuitive self, have found shelter in the characters and spaces from the world captured through image and sound which have aged just enough to correlate and run a parallel narrative. Having a twofold interior, Night and Fear is a personal essay addressed to the filmmaker\u2019s late grand aunt, but also a reflection on the impact of making films \u2013 on the filmmaker herself and the society. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by Q&A with the Director. \nScreening: Letter From Your Far-Off Country\nSuneil Sanzgiri | 2020 | 18 mins\nShot with 16mm film stock that expired in 2002\u2014the same year as the state-sponsored anti-Muslim genocide in Gujarat\u2014and filmed amid the anti-CAA protests in Delhi, the filmmaker traces lines and lineages of ancestral memory, poetry, history, songs, and ruins from his birth in 1989. \nScreening: Golden Jubilee\nSuneil Sanzgiri | 2021 | 19 mins\nWhat is liberation when so much has already been taken? Who has come for more? \u2018Golden Jubilee\u2019, takes as its starting point scenes of the filmmaker\u2019s father navigating a virtual rendering of their ancestral home in Goa, India, created using the same technologies of surveillance that mining companies use to map locations for iron ore in the region. A tool for extraction and exploitation becomes a method for preservation. The father, sparked by a memory of an encounter as a child, inhabits the voice of a spirit known locally as Devchar, whose task is to protect the workers, farmers, and the once communal lands of Goa. Protection from what the filmmaker asks. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n",

But the magnificent oeuvre of this renowned Thiruvalla-born cartoonist, artist, journalist, and author will endure.\u00a0 \nIn his nearly six-decade career, from the late 1940s to the early 2000s, with some of the leading publications in India and England, Abu captured the zeitgeist of those turbulent times in his prodigious output that comprised political cartoons, illustrations for newspaper columns, caricatures, comic strips, impressionist sketches, travel drawings, portraits, and even an animation film titled No Arks. \nOn display are cartoons, sketches, and notebooks, including some that have never been seen in public before. These works also chronicle his extensive travels all over the world, his presence at momentous events, and his meetings with the famous personalities of those times. Abu\u2019s career peaked in the 1970s after he returned to India from England. From his vantage point in the national capital, he was able to dissect major events like the Bangladesh War and the Emergency with his biting wit that never shied away from speaking truth to power. Not surprisingly, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was at the centre of most political developments, figured prominently in his cartoons, as did the national and regional leaders who were in opposition to her, including those from her own party. \nThis centenary exhibition provides a glimpse into Abu\u2019s large body of work, evoking his versatility as an artist and the spirit with which he lived his life. True to the ethos of political satire, he does not spare anyone! The exhibition has travelled to Kochi and Kolkata and will go to New Delhi after this show in Bangalore. Don\u2019t miss it! \nOn Sunday, August 25, 2024 at 11 am, as part of the exhibition \u201cAbu\u2019s World,\u201d there will be a panel discussion featuring cartoonists, journalists, and a historian. They will explore the impact and significance of Abu Abraham\u2019s work in their respective fields and its relevance in contemporary times. \nThis exhibition was supported by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi. \n(Text courtesy: Ayisha and Janaki Abraham, Mario Rodriguez, Siddharth Shivakumar, Prateeti Punja Ballal) \n",

    "description": "Manganiars of Rajasthan are a hereditary community of professional musicians from the villages of Barmer, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer in the desert areas of Western Rajasthan. The Manganiars and the Langas have a vast repertoire of folk music integral to their way of life and social systems. Their music, which has been preserved and passed down through generations, acts as a medium of information and storytelling, much like the postcards in your exhibition. \nThe Manganiars\u2019 music has survived for decades thanks to the traditional Jajmani (patronage) system, which supports their art form and livelihood. Their music has continued to survive for decades mainly because of the Jajmani (patronage) system, which is fundamental to their art form as well as the source of traditional livelihood. These traditional patrons have been supporting the economy of the communities of Langa and Manganiyar musicians for generations. \nAn eight-member team led by Sardar Khan Langa & Sawai Khan Manganiyar will present traditional folk music of Rajasthan along with Kalbeliya song & dance. Sardar Khan is a senior Langa guru, a very knowledgeable\u00a0person of Barnawa Jageer, and has traveled\u00a0worldwide to present traditional folk music. Sawai is a young Khartal player of Barna Jaisalmer who has collaborated with various world music maestros. The other members of the team consist of Deu Khan in vocals, Sikander Khan in Sindhi Sarangi & Algoza, and Samder\u00a0Khan in Dholak.

    "description": "The Red Corridor remains one of the most complex and challenging areas in India, marred by Naxal-State conflict, that has been shaping the lives of its residents for over half a century. In the years of reporting from the conflict zone of Bastar, journalist Ashutosh Bhardwaj pieced together The Death Script: Dreams and Delusions in Naxal Country. \nIn this session, Ashutosh will shed light on his experience in the conflict zone \u2013 reporting on the Maoist, the state atrocities, the plight of the Adivasis caught in the civil war and what it means to live through and write about these experiences as a journalist and a bilingual writer. He will talk about deviating from the traditional form of journalistic writing into more creative ones and the crossroads where these forms converge and diverge. The talk will also offer insights into the status of the Hindi media, its role in shaping the Hindi belt polity, and the urgent need to focus on and invest in this media section. \nAshutosh Bhardwaj will be in conversation with\u00a0Kannada author Vasudhendra followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Puertos de Tango (Tango Ports) aims to revisit lesser-known themes of great Uruguayan authors, thus keeping wonderful compositions alive. The project includes a special tribute to Astor Piazzolla and the great Uruguayan poet Horacio Ferrer, evoking much of their creative duo and reinterpreting part of their repertoire inspired by the artists\u2019 homeland, Uruguay. In this kind of cosmopolitan tango without temporal and spatial boundaries, some versions in Italian and French are included, justified in the words of Ram\u00f3n Pelinski (Argentine ethnomusicologist and composer) who describes tango as a \u201cglobal metaphor\u201d: a tango with infinite possibilities, capable of imagining and travelling to other worlds, without fear that \u201cits entire life is yesterday, holding it in its past.\u201d \nNatalia Bolani seeks her own interpretation from her perspective as an actor, resignifying and valuing the chosen texts through contemporary sounds, mainly appealing to the sound of the piano and the bandone\u00f3n, instruments with strong organic and referential connotations in Rio de la Plata culture. \nThe project intends to attract new audiences to this genre, as well as to offer a repertoire not usually enjoyed by those more familiar with the music. Its raison d\u2019\u00eatre is, ultimately, the encounter with the emotions, a meeting where interpretive and sonorous power intermingle in the same waters, in a kind of cathartic ritual through artistic creation. \nPresented by\u00a0the Embassy of Uruguay and MLC Estates LLP \n\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n \n",

Many times, \u2018survival\u2019 seems to involve concealing one\u2019s identities, flowing and lightening oneself, only to find that the path doesn\u2019t lead anywhere, leading to exhaustion. Yet, exhaustion isn\u2019t reason enough to give up the desire to soar. In the dark path, one must cling to life for the fireflies. Then, darkness becomes a celebration, light becomes a celebration. \nBob Marley from Kodihalli\u00a0is a collection of narratives that confront the many complex paradoxes surrounding identity. Here, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s \u2018Waiting for a Visa\u2019 becomes a metaphor, raising the crucial question: where is he really seeking admission? \nThis play explores the intricacies of identity, the struggles of concealment for survival, and the persistent hope symbolized by fireflies in darkness. It uses Ambedkar\u2019s work as a central theme to question the nature of acceptance and inclusion in society. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTextual Inspiration: N K Hanumanthaiah, Chandrashekara K\nWriting, Design and Direction: Lakshman KP\nDramaturgy: VL Narasimhamurthy\nPerformance text design and Acting: Mariyamma Chudi, Chandrashekar K, Shwetha Rani HK, Bharath Dingri\nLighting Design: Manju Narayan\nLights Execution: Sachin\nProduced by Nirdigantha\nA Jangama Collective Offering \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nSupported by \n \n\u00a0 \n",
