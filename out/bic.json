    "description": "What does the life of an ordinary working-class Indian look and feel like? \nJoin us for a panel discussion discussing this and more with the author of\u00a0The Many Lives of Syeda X Neha Dixit and commentator and editor Priya Ramani. \nIn her book The Many Lives of Syeda X\u00a0 journalist Neha Dixit traces the story of one such faceless Indian woman, Syeda X, from the early 1990s to the present day. What emerges is a picture of a life lived under constant corrosive tension. \nResearched for close to a decade, in this book, we meet an unforgettable cast of characters for whom\u00a0displacement, tragedy and hardships are the things they are used to. Written with empathy and deep insight, this book is a portal to a harsh world hidden away from elite Indians. It is the story of untold millions and a searing account of urban life in New India. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "A piece of music can be considered a pattern in time\u2026 the strange thing is that it\u00a0doesn\u2019t really exist until it is being played\u2026 A great work also captures something\u00a0of the era in which it was written and then travels through time via aural\u00a0tradition\u2026 or in notated form to be performed hundreds of years later. \nPatterns in Time, a range of music from the 16th century to the present, takes the audience through a journey not only through time but also through geographies and cultures from all over the world. \nThe concert begins with Spanish music inspired by the Andalusian flamenco tradition and will proceed to Renaissance and Baroque standards by Dowland, Scarlatti and Bach.\u00a0This will be followed by an extended and programmatic avant garde composition by the guitar virtuoso Pavel Steidl. \nThe second half of the recital will set off with some refreshingly tropical South American music and some tunes by Indian composers.\u00a0This will be followed by music inspired by Turkey and end with Shamal, an improvisatory piece consisting of extended techniques and percussion featuring a blend of sonorities and rhythms from the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. \n \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "This session\u00a0presents an enthralling journey through the rich history of the sitar, beginning with its origins and evolution across centuries. The performance explores the sitar\u2019s creation from natural elements, merging Persian and Indian musical traditions to symbolize its sacred and timeless nature. As the sitar travels through royal courts, it becomes a symbol of refinement and cultural prestige, before eventually establishing itself as a central instrument in Indian classical music. This concert highlights the transformation, showcasing the sitar\u2019s rise as a solo instrument and its deep connection to Indian music. \nHonoring the contributions of legendary sitarists like Ustad Vilayat Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar, this performance will illustrate their groundbreaking innovations that shaped the sitar\u2019s modern identity and global influence. From classical Indian ragas to cross-cultural experiments, the sitar\u2019s role in contemporary music will be explored, demonstrating its versatility and ongoing relevance in world music. Through a blend of storytelling and music, this performance celebrates the instrument\u2019s enduring legacy and its profound impact on both classical and global music. \nPresented by \n \n",

    "description": "Many years ago, in Detroit during a chance meeting with Jerry Murad of the Harmonicats, a commitment was made. Sulaiman Jamal met Jerry Murad at a harmonica convention, and he asked Sulaiman to continue playing the chromatic harmonica. He highlighted the versatility and beauty of the small instrument. That was Sulaiman\u2019s motivation and inspiration to continue playing the unique instrument which he had actually put in cold storage. \nWhile Jerry had passed away many years ago, Sulaiman was reminded by a mutual friend that he had not fulfilled Jerry\u2019s request \u2013 This concert is to do just that. \nThe theme of the concert is to cover some of the greatest Broadway and cinema themes, mainly from yesteryear which have warmed our hearts. \nThe evening will include favourites from Phantom of the Opera, The Wizard of Oz, Jesus Christ Superstar, Fiddler on the Roof and more. Not to forget the classics from The Beatles, Leonard Cohen, Simon and Garfunkel, and Big Band and Blues numbers. \nWith a group of extremely talented and accomplished musicians, the evening can\u2019t be anything but memorable.

    "description": "2022 | 86 min | Hindi and Bengali with\u00a0English\u00a0Subtitles | India \nAt the outskirts of Kolkata, the banks of the river Hooghly are lined with jetties and huge factories\u00a0in various states of operation and decay. Some industrial chimneys belch smoke while others have\u00a0trees growing out of them. This is the landscape of West Bengal\u2019s 165-year-old jute industry, which\u00a0once produced the ubiquitous gunny bags, rope, and jute textiles used by trade and commerce\u00a0around the world. Almost all of these functions have been largely replaced by plastic, which is\u00a0perhaps more durable but certainly environmentally disastrous. \nNearly forgotten, the jute industry is attracting renewed interest in the golden fibre due to its eco-friendly qualities. At the same time, the jute industry is in turmoil. A few mills remain in operation,\u00a0with frequent shutdowns and lockouts to replace workers with precision machines. Can\u00a0environmental concern recuperate a future for jute and for jute workers while there is still time? \nThe\u00a0Golden Thread contemplates itself as a product of an encounter between jute workers, early industrial machines, and jute fibre. What was an unwanted fibre for 50 years is now being hailed as\u00a0the \u2018fibre of the future\u2019. The act of filming is an act of archiving \u2013documenting a past that has\u00a0continued into the future, fade away. \nFilmmaker Nishtha Jain will be in conversation with Gautam Sonti after the screening.

    "description": "Join us for a discussion based on the book Poles Apart: The Military and Democracy in India and Pakistan. This session delves into the starkly different roles played by the military in the political landscapes of India and Pakistan, and how these choices have shaped the democratic trajectories of both nations. While Pakistan\u2019s history is marked by frequent military interventions that have hindered its democratic development, India\u2019s military has remained notably apolitical, even in moments of crisis such as the 1962 Sino-Indian War, the Emergency, and Operation Blue Star. \nExplore the critical moments where India\u2019s military could have intervened but chose to uphold democratic principles, contrasting with Pakistan\u2019s history of military dominance in politics. The discussion will also include insights into Bangladesh\u2019s unique experiments with democracy and military rule. This session offers a rare opportunity to understand how the military\u2019s influence\u2014or restraint\u2014can define a nation\u2019s political destiny. \nThe author, Aditya Sondhi will be in conversation with Journalist, Aunohita Mojumdar.

When Khusro came to Gulbarga in the Deccan region, the style of the Banda Nawaz brothers became prevalent and distinctive, rather than the traditional Qawwali. \nIn the Chishti school of thought, Qawwali holds a special place and is sometimes even accorded the status of worship. During this period, some Qawwali and music teachers of the Chishtiya lineage accompanied the Banda Nawaz brothers to the Deccan. These included the Banda Nawaz Nizami Sabri and other Banda Nawaz brothers known by various monikers. In Karnataka, they are referred to as Banda Nawaz Qawals. \nKarnatak Qawwali is one of the most popular musical styles in the Deccan, and its descendants continue to perform it. In Gulbarga Sharif, there is a branch of the Qawwali Brothers that is quite famous, known as the Banda Nawaz Brothers. This group includes Muhammad Tanveer Niazi, Salam Banda Nawaz, Khawaja Mian Banda Nawaz, and others. \nThe Sufi performers of Kalyana Karnataka are deeply connected with social alchemy, as they accompany every person, village, and Sufi of the region in public festivals and Urs celebrations, both large and small. These artists are truly public performers and can be considered ambassadors of Carnatic Sufi music in Kalyana Karnataka. The Banda Nawazi brothers\u2019 Qawwali is the custodian of this revived Sufi music, belonging to the same family and keeping the tradition alive through successive generations. \nThe beautiful and colourful compositions of Kalyana Karnataka are presented at various festivals, with their unique tone and ideas. The group has been awarded the prestigious Kalyana Karnataka Award. Their style of Qawwali, infused with local Sufism, is unique and reveals the influence of Sufi sages and their company. \nThe Qawwali tradition in Kalyana Karnataka is both a preserver and innovator of this ancient art form. The performers are skilled in choosing meaningful words and delivering them so the audience is inevitable moved and often in raptures . Their music does more than entertain \u2013 it offers spiritual fulfillment and teaches listeners about Sufi ideas and poetry. \nWhat makes this style special is how it blends different elements. It captures the heart of Sufi poetry while maintaining a classical feel. At the same time, it creates a unique sound by mixing broader Indian music styles with specific South Indian (Carnatic) traditions. \nThis combination of traditional roots and regional adaptation makes Kalyana Karnataka\u2019s Qawwali a rich and meaningful form of cultural expression. It speaks to people\u2019s hearts, minds, and souls, connecting them to both ancient wisdom and contemporary experiences. \nTo delve deeper into this rich history and cultural synthesis, scholars Rahamat Tarikere and Syed Rauf Quadri will provide expert insights. Professor Tarikere, known for his extensive research on Sufi traditions in Karnataka, will elucidate the historical context and evolution of Qawwali in the region. Dr. Quadri, an authority on poetry, Islamic mysticism and its musical expressions, will explore the spiritual dimensions and poetic nuances of the Kalyana Karnataka Qawwali tradition. Together, these scholars will offer a comprehensive understanding of the syncretic culture and musical traditions that have shaped Qawwali in the Deccan and Kalyana Karnataka regions. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Ardha \u2013 The Incomplete Dream is a solo work born out of a collection of essays contained in the book, Finding Radha by Namita Gokhale and Malashri Lal. Weaving together Bharatanatyam and spoken word, Ardha looks at Radha as the \u2018adhara\u2019 in whom the essence of Krishna is held. Beyond her oft-recognized status as Krishna\u2019s lover and his chosen gopi, Radha is \u2018Hladini Shakti\u2019 \u2013 the potency that is half of Krishna, their spirits engaged in perpetual \u2018Lila Hava\u2019- the exchange of ornaments, attire, and souls. \nCould Radha be an illusion that, through her dhara (flow) of joy and pain in union and separation, symbolizes the yearning for something beyond, a yearning that exists in every human? What happened to Radha after Krishna left Mathura? Why is Krishna celebrated while Radha, is a mere shadow in her aradhana to him? \nCredits:  \n\u2013 Concept, Choreography, Dance, Spoken word: Vidhya Subramanian \n\u2013 Music Composition: Shreya Devnath \n\u2013 Sound track produced at Resound India and mixed and mastered by Sai Shravanam \n\u2013 Musicians: Keerthana Vaidyanathan, Shreya Devnath, Sivaprasad, Sruti Sagar, Sai Shravanam, Manonmani, Vidhya Subramanian \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Bengaluru, India\u2019s economic engine, is a water-starved city. The Cauvery river, its lifeline, is\u00a0drying up and severely polluted, while the Western Ghats forests, where its waters originate, are rapidly degrading. Yet, the government continues to push for unsound projects like the\u00a0Mekedatu Dam and Yettinahole Drinking Water project, further damaging the rivers and forests\u00a0that sustain us. Amid this, the city remains disconnected from its rivers, yet perpetually thirsty. \nThis session will begin with a discussion followed by songs about rivers sung by children and an English adaptation of Komal\u00a0Swaminathan\u2019s 1980 satirical Tamil play Thaneer Thaneer. Set in a drought-ridden village in Tamil Nadu, the play follows a stranger who helps the villagers harness water against political and natural challenges, showing the power of a community deeply connected to its water sources. \nPaani.Earth, a citizen-led think tank, is dedicated to river conservation. The team will share\u00a0their efforts to protect the rivers that sustain us. Through this session, they aim to foster a deep\u00a0understanding and compassion for rivers \u2014 crucial for meaningful change. \n",
