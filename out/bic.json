    "description": "\u201cShruthi Maatha, Laya Pitah\u201d is a famous saying where Shruthi and Layam are seen as two most important fundamentals of music. Layam is a basic rhythm that flows through any movement, expressed as Thaalam (beats). There is an implicit Layam and explicit Layam. The former is something that has to be realised for the latter to be grounded into one\u2019s sensibilities and mind. \nMany music composers have explored this layam aspect of music, but the Trinity (Thyagarajaswamy , Muthuswamy Deekshitar and Shyama Saastrigal) stand out in this. Just like in Raagam, in Layam also they have many firsts. The basic framework of tala dasha pranas have also been used by them intelligently in their kritis. \nThis presentation will look at that basic framework of layam and how trinity made it shine even better, both intuitive and explicit. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Entertaining the nobility of India, her life was different from the other women around her. She had financial independence, she could choose her patrons and partners, and most importantly, she was highly skilled at her art, her music! \nTawaifs and women performers were given a reputation, one that made their life difficult and tainted them as prostitutes and sex workers. Unfortunately, history doesn\u2019t credit them enough for their most valuable contribution to Indian Culture, their Music! Even though they were known for Thumri, Dadra, other semiclassical forms like hori, jhoola, chaiti and so on, they were the first performers to set ghazals to tune and bring them to the performance space as a music genre. This performance will be tracing the evolution of this beautiful genre that gained popularity through the performance of Tawaifs and many other women performers over the years. \nO Gaanewali invites you on a journey through the rich cultural heritage of Indian music, sharing fascinating stories and anecdotes as it introduces iconic forms like thumri, dadra, hori, chaiti, and ghazal, made famous by the legendary Tawaifs and the many talented women who followed in their footsteps \nCreated for lovers for Ghazal, this format explores a slightly later time period in the lives of these artists, taking the audience through a nostalgic musical journey. Expect to hear some evergreen Ghazals like Aye Muhobbat Tere Anjaam Pe Rona Aya, Hum Dekhenge, Woh Jo Hum Mein Tum Mein Qarar Tha, Mere Humnafas and more! \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Recognising the potential of the handloom sector to provide sustainable employment and meet the growing demand for handloom fabric, the Government of Karnataka introduced \u2018Mahatma Gandhi Vastrodyama\u2019, a liaison between weaver co-operatives, producers, and the market, in last year\u2019s budget. However, this project has not progressed beyond a few meetings and the initial proposal stage. Meanwhile, the past year has seen the condition of handloom weavers decline further, reaching a state of emergency. Without proper access to markets and design interventions, they are unable to realise the true value of their traditional skills. \nAs we face increasing natural disasters, periods of flood and drought, and the looming climate catastrophe, ecologically sustainable rural industries such as handlooms and khadi can provide sustainable employment opportunities without harming nature. On Handloom Day, we hope to rekindle this discussion and draw attention to this critical issue. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Where does our fabric come from? What transforms a ball of cotton into the comfortable clothes we wear? In our fast-paced, consumerist society, many of us are unaware of the origins of our clothing. While we buy a lot of clothes, the weavers behind them often earn meager sums for their labor and effort. Consumers frequently spend large amounts on what they believe to be handloom and handspun fabrics, but they often lack the means to verify the authenticity of their purchases. Much of the handloom fabric available in the market is made from mill-spun yarn containing polyester and viscose. \nFor urban spinners, spinning yarn is therapeutic. It disconnects us from our devices and connects us to something tangible. Spinning is meditative and accessible to people of all ages (8 years and up). It promotes slow, sustainable living and supports an equitable ecosystem for handloom weavers, tailors, and fabric dyers. \nThe aim of this session is to raise awareness about yarn spinning and demonstrate the transformation of cotton into yarn for fabric making. The session will include a\u00a012-minute video on the context of the craft, demonstrations of spinning using the Peti Charkha, demonstrations of spinning using the Gandhi Charkha and much more! \n",

This was puzzling since elephants were present on other Indian Ocean islands like Sumatra, Borneo, and Sri Lanka, which share a similar geological history and were accessible from the continent during the Pleistocene glaciations. Adding to the mystery, the Andamans are home to primitive tribes who likely reached the islands by land during the last Ice Age. So, why were elephants absent? \nIronically, starting in 1858, the British colonial administration imported elephants by ship from Burma and India to the Andamans for use in the timber extraction industry, where these animals were essential. During the 20th century, some of these elephants escaped or were abandoned, finding refuge on deserted islands where they returned to the wild. This phenomenon is unique in the history of the species, which is otherwise suffering from habitat loss across Asia. \nHow did these elephants reach the islands? Did they swim across the sea as commonly believed? This film investigates the enigmatic history of the Andaman elephants. \nA screening of the documentary will be followed by a conversation with the Directors,\u00a0Philippe Gautier & Prajna Chowta and a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "What went wrong with capitalism? Ruchir Sharma\u2019s account is not like any you will have heard before. He says progressives are right, in part, when they mock modern capitalism as \u201csocialism for the rich.\u201d For a century, governments have expanded in just about every measurable dimension, from spending to regulation and the scale of financial rescues when the economy wobbles. The result is expensive state guarantees for everyone\u2014bailouts for the rich, entitlements for the middle class, welfare for the poor. \nTaking you back to the 19th century, Sharma shows how completely the reflexes of government have changed: from hands-off to hands-on, from doing too little to help anyone in hard times to today trying to prevent anyone suffering any economic pain, ever. Trading sins of omission and indifference for excesses of spending and meddling, governments from the United States to Europe and Japan have pumped so much money into their economies that financial markets can no longer invest all that capital efficiently. \nInadvertently, they have fueled the rise of monopolies, \u201czombie\u201d firms, and billionaires. They have made capitalism less fair and less efficient, which is slowing economic growth and fueling popular anger. The first step to a cure is a correct diagnose of the problem. Capitalism has been badly distorted by constant government intervention and the relentless spread of a bailout culture. Building an even bigger state will only double down on what ruined capitalism in the first place. \nThe author, Ruchir Sharma, will be in conversation with\u00a0Chairman and Co-founder, Infosys and Founding Chairman\u00a0UIDAI\u00a0(Aadhaar), Nandan Nilekani. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Demonised as he was after his death, the reign of King Ravana of Lanka, and his ancestors, the powerful Mayuranga, has long been obscured and shrouded in myth. Their kingdom is believed to have reached beyond the shores of the island, once, capturing lands across the seas. A kingdom of such magnitude was never seen again on Lanka. \nIn a bid to shed light on this lost era, Sunela Jayewardene travelled through Sri Lanka, and listened to the storytellers and poets, researched Sri Lanka\u2019s folklore, sifted through race and religion, to stitch together a history of a forgotten landscape. \nThe story of the kingdom that\u00a0Ravana\u00a0had ruled lay over the island like a fading, antique map. The edges of the story were frayed and there were lines disconnected by time, but the landscape it traced, exists. Ravana\u2019s Lanka: The Landscape of a Lost Kingdom, written by Sunela Jayewardene is the story she learnt of King Ravana and the kingdom that he lost. \nIn this session, Sunela will be in conversation with Theatre Practitioner, Anuradha Venkataraman. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",
