    "description": "This conversation will shift your understanding of power, and of possibility. \nRahila Gupta will discuss how male dominance persists across radically different societies from theocracies to democracies, dictatorships to socialist states. Her co-authored book Planet Patriarchy, asks what makes patriarchy so resilient and where feminism is not just surviving but genuinely thriving. \nAt the heart of the conversation is a revelation: a little-known women\u2019s revolution in Rojava, Northeast Syria. Here, women are building a bottom-up democracy rooted in multi-ethnic inclusivity and ecological sustainability. It\u2019s a radical reimagining of power that challenges everything we think we know about governance and gender. \nConcluding with an audience Q&A, this session invites you to rethink power, resilience, and the possibilities of feminist futures: one where gender equality isn\u2019t an afterthought but the foundation. \n",

    "description": "A society fails not when it lacks talent, but when talent has nowhere to go. \nIn this lecture, Professor Anirudh Krishna invites us to reimagine opportunity not as luck or merit, but as something societies deliberately construct. Drawing on over a decade of global research across countries and contexts, this lecture asks an uncomfortable question: how much potential are we wasting when millions operate far below what they\u2019re truly capable of? \nThrough stories of nations that have successfully built strong pathways to success, we\u2019ll explore the architecture of progress: the schools, networks, policies, and cultural shifts that turn capacity into achievement. This isn\u2019t your average abstract policy talk but rather a conversation to understand the structures that launch young people toward their dreams or leave them stranded. \nWhether you\u2019re an educator, policymaker, parent, or simply someone who cares about untapped potential, this conversation will reshape how you think about development and the futures we\u2019re building together! \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "The Preamble of the Indian Constitution begins with \u201cWe, the people of India,\u201d but do we really know how true that rings?\u00a0 \nIn popular memory, the Constitution often appears as the work of a few eminent figures. Assembling India\u2019s Constitution reveals a more layered story; one in which citizens, communities, labour groups, women\u2019s organisations, and emerging political movements actively influenced constitutional ideas. Across the country, people petitioned, campaigned, debated rights, and pushed the Assembly to consider questions of citizenship, minority protections, gender equality, land reform, labour, and democratic participation. And crucially, the Assembly listened. \nDrawing on years of archival research, authors Ornit Shani and Rohit De illuminate how debates unfolding outside the Constituent Assembly; sometimes in distant or overlooked regions, filtered into its deliberations, shaping decisions that continue to define India\u2019s democracy. They sought to make constitutional history accessible, grounded, and alive, inviting readers to see the Constitution not as a static text but as a living achievement of millions. \nThe authors will offer a short presentation of the book, followed by reflections from panelists Arvind Narrain and Arun Thiruvengadam. The event concludes with an audience Q&A. \n",

    "description": "We can always get by with a little help from our friends! \nBasava, a young boy, discovers this for himself when a search for firewood in the forest turns into an unexpected journey shaped by the gentle magic of helping others. \nTo mark the 20th anniversary of Basava and the Dots of Fire, author Radhika Chadha will do a special reading of her much-beloved tale. First published by Tulika Books in 2005 and now in its seventh reprint, the book has become a steady favourite among parents, reviewers and young readers alike. Celebrated for its warm narrative of kindness and friendship, as well as illustrations that make every page feel like artwork, it continues to be recommended as a standout picture book two decades after its debut. \nJoin us for a joyful session that revisits a story whose sparks of wonder and empathy glow brightly long after it is read. \nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins, not with a ticket, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Love unfolds in countless shades, and dance is its most eloquent witness! \nPallavi frames the journey with invocations to Shiva, the cosmic dancer whose eternal rhythm anchors all experience. Between these moments, a trio of evocative episodes unfolds: a heroine confiding in her friend about the king she longs for, a courtesan challenging her lover\u2019s hollow assurances, and a wife embracing one final night with her husband before he departs for war. Each vignette reveals how love moves through vulnerability, desire, frustration, and devotion. \nThis performance features Raghuram Rajagopalan on vocals, Vinay Nagarajan on mridangam, Mathur R. Srinidhi on violin, and Sahana Sridhar leading the Nattuvangam. With a distinguished live ensemble supporting her, Pallavi offers an intimate exploration of love\u2019s many textures.\u00a0 \nAn evening that lingers like a feeling you recognise before you can name. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "How does ideology become actionable?\u00a0 \nIn the padippakkam (reading rooms) of Tamil Nadu, ideas spread like wildfire. Pamphlets passed from hand to hand and conversations stretched endlessly. What began as intellectual restlessness soon crystallised into a shared civic consciousness.\u00a0 \nThe Dravidian Pathway traces how this cultural churning transformed into one of India\u2019s most enduring political movements. Vignesh Rajahmani\u2019s study illuminates the Dravidian movement\u2019s sophisticated synthesis of anti-caste thought, aspirations for socio-economic mobility, and an inclusive Dravidian\u2013Tamil identity; an evolution that culminated in the emergence of the electorally formidable DMK. In his account, ideology is never abstract: it is lived, negotiated, and embodied by ordinary people seeking dignity and opportunity. \nIn this discussion, Rajahmani is joined by Dr. Srikrishna Ayyangar and Dr. Atreyee Majumder, to examine the strategies of Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, K. Kamaraj, C.N. Annadurai, and M. Karunanidhi, and consider how their ideas continue to shape Tamil Nadu\u2019s political imagination in an age of rising majoritarianism. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

As India confronts a deepening NCD crisis, the deeper question this conversation raises is unsettling and urgent: if risk begins before birth, how do we protect a future we cannot yet see?\u00a0 \nThe session will examine why early nutrition, air pollution, toxic exposures, and social environments matter as much as adult lifestyle. Dr Kalpana Balakrishnan will discuss how air and toxic exposures affect health beyond the lungs, while Dr Naveen Ramesh will address how nutrition, social systems, and public health responses come into play. The discussion will be moderated by Dr Ashok Vellodi. \nThis panel discussion invites a rethinking of public health itself, from treatment to prevention, from adulthood to the very start of life.\u00a0A Q&A with the audience will close the session. \n",

    "description": "A triple bill of Indian classical dance; transforming the negotiations of modern life into electrifying movement. \nPlay Ball brings together three sharply etched Bharatanatyam and Kathak pieces that reimagine modern experience through classical form. Premiered in India to wide acclaim at the Natya Kala Conference in 2019, the production showcases an all-female cast of dancers whose performances move fluidly between playful, tender, and powerfully precise. Conceptualised and choreographed by Nina Rajarani MBE, one of the UK\u2019s leading choreographers, with original scores composed, directed, and sung by Y Yadavan, the evening is lifted further by live music that draws audiences into each world on stage. \nAcross the three works, the central question unfolds: what does it take to play ball?\n\u201cKadala\u2026 Is It Love?\u201d follows a relationship strained by wavering fidelity; \u201cBend It\u2026\u201d transforms the football field into a rhythmic, high-energy dance of rivalry and camaraderie; and \u201cQuick!\u201d turns the corporate arena into a tightly choreographed contest of ambition and urgency: the piece that won Rajarani the 2006 Place Prize, Europe\u2019s largest choreographic award. \nRajarani\u2019s fusion feels both deeply familiar and strikingly new. These works capture the pulse of contemporary life through the language of classical dance, offering an evening where tradition meets the spirited negotiations of the modern world.\u00a0 \nConcept, Choreography and Artistic Direction: Nina Rajarani MBE\nMusic Composition and Direction: Y Yadavan\nLight Engineering: B Charles\nSound Engineering: Shanthosh Kannan\nMultimedia Design: Gaurav Singh Nijjer\nMultimedia Operations: Nikhil Bansal \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "A tradition stays alive not by preservation alone, but by the courage to reimagine. \nThis concert pays homage to the Hindustani classical musicians of the 20th century: artists who honoured an ancient lineage while boldly reshaping it for a changing world. As India awakened to independence, they too evolved with it, expanding melodic possibilities, reimagining rhythm, and infusing contemporary thought into timeless ragas. Legends such as Pt. Dinkar Kaikini, Pt. Kumar Gandharva, Vid. Prabha Atre, Vid. Veena Sahasrabuddhe, Begum Akhtar, and Farida Khanum helped forge a modern, resonant Hindustani idiom whose influence endures today. \nMaahi and Neil revisit this rich inheritance through ragas like Yaman Kalyan, Bihag, Multani, and Bhairavi, alongside select semi-classical pieces. Both artistes will present vocal works. Maahi will be accompanied by Neil on the Appalachian dulcimer, while Neil\u2019s performance will feature Aniket on classical electric guitar. Kaushik will provide the rhythmic accompaniment on tabla for both. \nAn evening to honour the musicians who made this music timeless. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Overwhelmed? Disoriented? Exhausted? \nIn this reflective session, Dr. Shyam Bhat draws on his expertise in psychiatry and integrative medicine to unpack the rising sense of disorientation shaped by hyperconnection, constant noise, and emotional overload. He explores how these forces fracture our inner clarity, and offers practical ways to rebuild a steadier sense of purpose. Drawing from both clinical experience and contemplative traditions, Dr. Bhat charts a path toward reconnecting with our values and rediscovering direction in an increasingly fast-paced world. \nA gentle invitation to pause, understand what\u2019s unfolding within, and realign with what truly matters. \nThe talk will be followed by an audience Q&A. \nPresented by: \nNirvikalpa Integrated Therapy Foundation\nFounded by Dr. Shyam Bhat, the Nirvikalpa Integrated Therapy Foundation blends India\u2019s philosophical and psychological wisdom with modern Western science to create a rigorous, evidence-based therapeutic model grounded in non-duality and transcendence. The foundation conducts scientific research, develops therapist-training programs, and shares integrative mental-health insights with the public. Its work aims to build a culturally rooted, systematic approach to therapy that strengthens resilience, deepens connection, and supports collective well-being. \n \n",

    "description": "A princess who walked away from the palace. A woman who defied family, society and expectations to sing her devotion. Meera\u2019s voice rings through centuries, distinct and uncompromising. \nIn a canon dominated by male Bhakti and Sufi mystic poets, Meera carved her own path. Her songs speak of pure, love-filled devotion to Krishna, but they also explore complex yogic ideas that challenge our understanding of spiritual practice. She didn\u2019t just worship: she wandered, questioned, and transformed herself into a yogini free from the expectations placed on the women of her time. \nThis musical session explores the many colours of Meera through folk songs from Rajasthan and beyond. Vipul Rikhi will trace how her voice differs from her male contemporaries, how her femininity shapes her devotion and how her rebellion becomes inseparable from her spirituality.\u00a0 \nA chance to hear Meera as a radical figure who redefined what devotion could mean. \nSupported by: \n \n",
