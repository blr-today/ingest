    "description": "The integration of Large Language models in AI has sparked a global revolution, epitomized by the recent release of ChatGpt 4.0, which promises increased efficiency and streamlined workflows. Yet, as these models evolve, we\u2019re left pondering whether they\u2019ll lead us to a utopia of shorter workweeks and enhanced living standards or a landscape fraught with complexity. \nWhile AI offers immense potential for proactive healthcare, educational advancements, and combating financial crime, it also raises pressing concerns around discrimination, erosion of personal freedoms, and the need for greater accountability. Can these challenges be addressed effectively? How far has AI progressed, and what are its limitations? \nThe authors of the graphic novel Dream Machine: Real or AI have delved into these pressing questions. \nJoin Appupen, one of the authors of the book, in discussion with Francis Rousseaux, an expert in AI, Machine Learning, and Digital Humanities and also the French representative at the think tank iSPIRIT, as they engage in conversation with Digital humanities expert and innovator Padmini Ray Murray. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Shortly after D-Day, John Maynard Keynes and his colleagues sailed to New York on a secret mission. Accompanying them was a small delegation from India. It included a future finance minister, RBI governor, and a director of Tata sons.\u00a0Keynes and his co-passengers were headed to the United Nations Monetary Conference convened by President Roosevelt at Bretton Woods \u2013 a hill station in New Hampshire \u2013 in July 1944. \nAt that conference, forty-four countries including India pledged to reconstruct a war-ravaged world, sustain peace, and promote economic development. To do so, they created the International Monetary Fund and The World Bank.\u00a0Although it\u00a0was not\u00a0fully independent, India played a critical role at the conference. It later became a founding member of both international financial institutions \nJoin us as we explore through rare photographs, oral histories and recently declassified documents the personalities and events involved in this important moment in world history. This talk by Vikram Raghavan will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

But like all the great works, this play has a possibility. of presentation beyond space and time. This production is such an attempt to transpose beyond all the boundaries. The \u2018song\u2019 of the valley crosses the valley, the life inside the valley continues its song. the play unveils this conflict. \nThe play showcases and tries balance the lives of the aborigines who are alienated and enslaved in their own land, the miracles of the land where small seeds grow into big fruit, and the cities that sow the dream of liberation despite the many dangers. The play makes us not to see life in black and white, but to see it through logical and rational vision. Here, the playwright insists that the character of playwright and of Grandpa Bucks should be played by the same actor, thereby directing us not to emotionally lean to any one side of the conflict. \nThis is how the song of the valley resounds; not only in our hearts, but also in our minds:\nI am incredibly hurt and angry about South Africa\u2019s history and present. But love is the only energy I\u2019ve ever used as a writer. I\u2019ve never written out of anger, although anger has informed love. \u2013 Athol Fugard. \nCast and Crew:\nPlaywright: Athol Fugard\nTranslation: Dr. Meera Moorthy\nMusic: Anush Shetty and Munna Mysore\nMusic accompany: Chethan Singanallur\nLighting: Vinay Ganesh, Mysore\nPainting: H.

    "description": "1970 | 113 Minutes | Kannada with English Subtitles \nThe body of a renegade Brahmin awaits a funeral. The man in question flouted Brahmin caste regulations, attracting a cadre of youthful followers. However, the Brahmin elders of his village cannot decide whether to give him a traditional Brahmin cremation or treat him as an outcast. Until they decide, neither they nor their immediate families may eat. This film offers an intriguing glimpse into the lives and issues surrounding an orthodox community. \nCalling all cinephiles! BIC is thrilled to introduce B-Cinematic, an initiative dedicated to celebrating the most essential, impactful, and artistically significant cinematic works from across the state and the country. \nAt B-Cinematic, our mission is to curate and share those remarkable films that is a must-watch (or re-watch) experience for every passionate cinema lover. From groundbreaking classics to under-appreciated gems, our carefully curated selection will take you on an unparalleled (pun not intended) cinematic journey through the ages. \nThrough curated screenings, insightful discussions, and engaging analyses from distinguished cinematic voices, we aim to not only watch these films together but to truly appreciate their craftsmanship, cultural impact, and intellectual depth. Our vibrant community of film aficionados will collectively rediscover Indian cinema\u2019s most stunning and enduring masterpieces. \nSo join us on this quest to experience the films that have defined and redefined the art form. Don\u2019t miss out on crossing these essential works off your bucket list. Because to truly live, you must first watch the films that make life worth living. \nThe second film in our informal film club is\u00a0Samskara (1970) \nSamskara is a critically acclaimed Kannada film directed by T Pattabhirama Reddy, released in 1970. It is based on the 1965 novel of the same name by UR Ananthamurthy. The film offers a thought-provoking exploration of traditional Brahmin society and its rigid customs. \nThe story revolves around a small Brahmin agrahara (village) that is thrown into turmoil after the death of Naranappa, a Brahmin man known for his defiance of caste rules and unorthodox lifestyle. His unconventional ways had earned him the wrath of the agrahara\u2019s conservative leaders. \nAfter Naranappa\u2019s death, the question arises whether he should be given the traditional Brahmin funeral rites or denied them due to his transgressions against caste norms. This dilemma deeply divides the agrahara, with ideological conflicts arising between the youths influenced by Naranappa\u2019s progressive thinking and the rigidly orthodox elderly Brahmin custodians of tradition. \nThe film sensitively portrays the agrahara\u2019s decaying feudal system and the inner contradictions plaguing its self-appointed patriarchal authorities as they grapple with existential questions about ritualism, sexuality, and the rapidly changing social mores. It offers a nuanced critique of entrenched casteism, misogyny, and blind adherence to outdated customs. \nWith its authentic depiction of the Brahmin way of life, powerful symbolism, and philosophical undertones, Samskara is regarded as a landmark film in Kannada cinema\u2019s Parallel Cinema movement and a masterpiece of Indian neo-realist filmmaking. \nThe film won the President\u2019s Gold Medal in 1971 and the Bronze Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1972 among several other recognitions. \nCredits: \nBased on UR Ananthmurthy\u2019s Kannada novel, Samskara; Translated to English by AK Ramanujan\nProduced and Directed by Pattabhirama Reddy\nScreenplay: Girish Karnad, T Pattabhirama Reddy and Singeetam Srinivasa Rao\nDialogue: Girish Karnad\nProduced: Pattabhirama Reddy\nCast: Girish Karnad, Snehalata Reddy, P.

    "description": "The Great Flap of 1942\u00a0is a narrative history of a neglected and scarcely known period\u2014between December 1941 and mid-1942\u2014when all of India was caught in a state of panic. This was largely a result of the British administration\u2019s mistaken belief that Japan was on the verge of launching a full-fledged invasion. It was a time when the Raj became unduly alarmed, when the tongue of rumour wagged wildly about Japanese prowess and British weakness and when there was a huge and largely unmapped exodus (of Indians and Europeans) from both sides of the coastline to \u2018safer\u2019 inland regions. This book demonstrates, quite astonishingly, that the Raj cynically encouraged the exodus and contributed to the repeated cycles of rumour, panic and flight. It also reveals how the shadow of the Japanese threat influenced the course of nationalist politics, altered British attitudes towards India and charted the course towards Independence. \nThe title \u2018The Great Flap of 1942\u2019 refers to an expression used by British bureaucrats in India that traces a broad narrative arc, starting with the Japanese attacks in South-East Asia. The assault on Malaya, the conquest of Singapore, the bombing and eventual occupation of Burma, and the Japanese Navy\u2019s foray into the Indian Ocean are examined in the light of the tremendous impact they had on India. \nThe author of the book, Mukund Padmanabhan, will be in conversation with Historian & Columnist, V Sriram. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Wild Women: Seekers, Protagonists and Goddesses in Sacred Indian Poetry\u00a0[Penguin India, 2024], edited by poet and seeker Arundhathi Subramaniam, is a new anthology of compelling women mystics in Indian literature. \nThese poems are the cries of women who refused, quietly, and sometimes not so quietly, to be bullied into submission. Women who surrendered not to the authority of the world, but to the authority of the spirit. Women whose voices have far too often been sanitized by the grand narratives of religion and sidelined by rationalist versions of history. \nThe names of Mirabai, Akka Mahadevi, and Andal, are known to many. But there are innumerable others. And little is known of the urgency of their words, of their feral sensuality, of their relentless questioning of\u00a0the custodians of gender and faith. It is time to re-fang them, to tune into their brazenness and heartbreaking longing. Not just for their sake, but for ours. \nThis\u00a0conversation with Arundhathi Subramaniam, interspersed by readings of translations by Mani Rao, Vanamala Viswanatha and Ahalya Ballal, will explore some fascinating and unforgettable women. \n",

    "description": "The summer monsoon is the primary source of rainfall in India. Year-to-year summer monsoon variability causes the deficit and surplus of rainfall during the monsoon season. The prolonged deficit can cause meteorological drought during the monsoon season, propagating to agricultural and hydrological droughts. Droughts pose tremendous challenges for water availability, agriculture, energy, and several other sectors, with profound implications for people\u2019s socio-economic well-being. \nIn this talk, Dr. Mishra will discuss some of the major droughts that occurred in the past and affected the Indus Valley Civilization, the flow of the Ganga River, and caused famines during the British era. He will also discuss some of the recent droughts and their impacts along with the impacts of climate change and whether anthropogenic climate change will make droughts more severe or not. Finally, Dr. Mishra will summarise the grand challenges associated with droughts and water availability in India in the context of building climate resilience.\u00a0\u00a0A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nThis session is part of the Let\u2019s Talk Climate Change Talk series. \nPresented by:\n \n",

In due course, these new technologies made long-distance travel and communication widely accessible and affordable. In a parallel development, the introduction of limited representation in legislatures in the 1890s added urgency to tap the potential trans-local identities enumerated in the decennial censuses beginning in 1871-72. \nIn view of these developments, local communities, in particular, castes, tapped new technologies to connect with kindred groups across the country and combine to form pan-Indian communities. Post offices allowed members of these aggregate groupings to correspond with each other, while railways enabled them to meet periodically and devise strategies to capture a share in legislatures, educational institutions and public employment proportionate to their census population. Drawing upon philatelic material covering a century, the exhibition highlights the role of the postal system in this new politics. \nThe exhibition is divided into two broad parts that bring together correspondence and publications of several caste-based community organisations and individuals from across the country and the philatelic output of the post-colonial state.\u00a0The exhibition has been curated by Vikas Kumar, who teaches economics at Azim Premji University. \nProf Gopal Guru will inaugurate the exhibition and deliver the inaugural address on May 31, 6:45 pm. He will comment on the exhibition and locate its images in the larger politics of visual culture. \nA Panel Discussion with\u00a0Prof. Satish Deshpande, a distinguished social scientist who has made seminal contributions to our understanding of caste in independent India, Vaishna Roy,\u00a0Editor-in-Chief, Frontline magazine and Vikas Kumar, Curator of the exhibit, will take place on 2 June, 11:45 am. \nIn collaboration with\u00a0Azim Premji University, Bangalore \n \n",

Subbarao recounts that journey \u2013 his hopes and despair, his successes and setbacks, his mistakes and misdeeds, and the lessons he learnt along the way \u2013 with candour and honesty. The subtext of that story though is his constant soul searching about whether he has given back to society more than he received. \nJust a Mercenary? is an earnest account of an extraordinary career that tries to inform and inspire young professionals trying to find their way up their career ladders \u2013 and find meaning in their journeys. \nSubbarao will be in conversation with Prof. MS Sriram of IIM, Bangalore.

    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations, the wealth-worth billions in today\u2019s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change \u2013 the emotional and the rational \u2013 and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change\u2014something prevalent in today\u2019s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away.\u00a0The authors will share their insight\u00a0on how it\u2019s imperative to draw lessons from the past, navigate the present, and prepare for the future.

    "description": "50 minutes | English and Kannada\u00a0 \nJust Hiss is a compelling adaptation of the short folk story titled A Serpent\u2019s Predicament. Just Hiss\u00a0is an ode to coexistence, following the transformative journey of a snake to choose love over hate. As the play navigates the complex dynamics between the snake, the forest denizens, and the villagers of Rasbharpur, it skillfully tackles the universal themes of unity and understanding. The resonant narrative serves as a reminder of the profound impact that choices, particularly those rooted in love and compassion, can have on fostering harmony in a world shared by diverse beings. \nDirector\u2019s note: \nJust Hiss\u00a0is not just a play; it is a whimsical journey crafted especially for children, featuring endearing animal characters. At its heart, it unfolds an analogical tale, resonant with the pressing message of our times\u2014understanding the limitations of one\u2019s perspective and the imperative need to embrace and accommodate others. \nConceived with meticulous care and having undergone several work-in-progress phases, this play is a testament to the idea that assumptions should yield to genuine inquiry. It serves as a reminder to care enough to ask, fostering the spirit of coming together and progressing impactfully. \n",
