    "description": "Futures Hubba originated as an ideas-festival at BLR Hubba, where some of the brightest national and international minds play Nostradamus to connect the dots of a likely future for humanity. It is a gathering designed to hold space for contradictions and uncertainty in this technology-shifting era, and to explore what new forms of meaning can emerge between the known and the unknown. \nFutures is a space for collective imagination: it\u2019s a space that holds tension between art and algorithm, ethics and innovation, intuition and data. It resists the safety of linear silos and instead operates at the intersections, where new ways of thinking are born from friction. Each session inside Futures is a deliberate provocation: a chance to expand what we consider knowledge, and to explore how interdisciplinary thinking might co-create more conscious futures. \nThe Future of Diplomacy |\u00a0Philip Green | 2 PM\nThe death of diplomacy has been proclaimed many times: eclipsed by direct leader-to-leader engagement, an increase in open information, or the rise of non\u2011state actors. Yet in an increasingly contested world, diplomacy has proven not only resilient, but essential, particularly for Australia where domestic and international challenges are tightly interwoven. While the tradecraft of diplomacy has evolved to be faster, more digital, and more analytical; its fundamentals, such as value of personal relationships and deep-on\u2011the\u2011ground understanding, continue to endure. The diplomatic agenda has also widened to include technology, climate, space and the management of disinformation, which need to be supported by greater specialist expertise. Join Australian High Commissioner to India, Philip Green, for a perspective on the future of diplomacy and its continued centrality as an instrument of statecraft. \nThe Future Is Already Misunderstood |\u00a0Riel Miller | 3 PM\nMost conversations about the future are trapped in prediction, control, and nostalgia disguised as progress. In this talk, renowned futurist Riel Miller dismantles the assumption that the future is something to be forecasted or managed, and argues instead that our real blind spot is imagination itself. This session challenges participants to confront their inherited ideas of \u201cwhat comes next\u201d and reclaim the future as a practice, not a destination. \nRe-Imagining Progress for a Depleted World |\u00a0Navi Radjou | 4 PM\nToday, the world faces three types of depletion\u2014affecting people, places, and the planet\u2014which are all losing their vitality. Regenerating individuals, cities, and nature at the same time calls for a new perspective on progress. Rather than being straightforwardly linear, progress is more like a circular journey where the past and future connect synergistically to address complex modern challenges.\u00a0Renowned management thinker Navi Radjou will demonstrate how India can lead the way in regenerative innovation, a groundbreaking approach designed to enhance the health and vitality of people, places, and the planet together. By blending its abundant traditional wisdom with futuristic technologies, India has the potential to set an example of positive growth that unlocks human potential and benefits both society and the environment. \nFeminist Futures: The Infrastructure of Equality |\u00a0Kanta Singh | 5 PM\nThis talk contends that the next frontier of gender equality will be determined not in boardrooms or parliaments alone, but in the architecture of technology itself. Artificial intelligence, digital identity, fintech, and public data ecosystems are rapidly becoming the new gatekeepers of opportunity, yet they often replicate the very biases they claim to solve. The session examines how India can design technological systems that expand agency rather than entrench exclusion; how women can shape innovation rather than be shaped by it; and why feminist frameworks are essential for governing algorithms, capital flows, safety platforms, and care technologies. It makes the case that equitable futures require women not only participating in tech, but authoring its rules, ethics, and outcomes. \nTeaching AI to Wonder: Math Meets Machine |\u00a0Yang-Hui He | 6 PM\nArtificial intelligence is no longer confined to crunching numbers: it is beginning to propose original theorems, sketch proofs and reveal new and unexpected patterns in the abstract world of mathematics and theoretical physics. Join Professor Yang-Hui He, one of the pioneers of AI-assisted mathematics, in exploring how AI is helping humans with new mathematical discoveries, and how in turn, we are teaching the machine how to wander and to perceive beauty. \nThe Architecture of Moral Imagination | Tenzin Priyadarshi Rinpoche | 7 PM\nA contemplative dialogue on ethics and empathy, exploring the moral frameworks that may shape the age of AI. \nResonant Futures: 432 Hz |\u00a0Transmedia Performance by Murthovic x Thiruda | 8 PM\n432_Hz: Resonant Futures is an immersive audiovisual journey into a future India where all forms of communication\u2014digital, emotional, biological, environmental\u2014are conducted through harmonic resonance. Set in the year 2069, when electromagnetic signals have given way to vibrational networks rooted in ancient Indian sonic traditions, the performance brings together modular synths, generative visuals, AI-processed music, and speculative world-building to conjure a live cinema experience that blends mythology, futurism, and ecology.\u00a0In this future, communication is no longer transmitted\u2014it is felt. From the humming of banyan trees to the pulse of Himalayan resonance towers, the Indian subcontinent becomes a \u201cNada Web\u201d: a landscape of vibratory sentience. \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences. Through this initiative, we collaborate with various venues, extending the reach of our events beyond our own space. These partnerships not only breathe life into our gatherings but also play a crucial role in cultivating an environment for the flourishing of arts and culture in the city. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

Through failure, hesitation, and embodied play, the fool reveals what rational systems often miss: that not-knowing is not a weakness, but a form of wisdom. In a world obsessed with control and prediction, this performance invites the audience to sit with uncertainty, and recognise it as the starting point of all futures. \nWhat is the Future of Art? |\u00a0Reema Desai Gehi | 5:15 PM\nAmid global upheaval, what role is creative expression called upon to fulfil? How does it remain responsive in an age where technology has advanced beyond human comprehension, and where self-censorship quietly precedes its public counterpart? Can art, in its many forms, truly function as a living archive of the present moment? Reema Desai Gehi engages with these pressing inquiries as she reflects on the evolving landscape of art through the prism of ART India magazine\u2019s 30th anniversary. \nHuman Dreams and Speculative Machines |\u00a0Horst H\u00f6ertner | 6 PM\nThe real disruption today is not AI, robotics, or digital culture: it is the shifting role of creativity itself. Art and technology have stopped reflecting the world and started constructing it. Drawing on 30 years working at the intersection of art and technology, Horst H\u00f6rtner shows how real innovation emerges when artists and technologists are given the freedom to challenge foundational assumptions. This lecture pulls back the curtain on how Ars Electronica turns experimentation into institutional practice, how it protects curiosity from bureaucracy, and why the future will belong to organizations that stop optimizing the present and start prototyping new realities. Art and tech will transform society. The only choice left is whether to participate, or be shaped by those who do. \nRise of Creative & Cultural AI Models |\u00a0Caroline Pegram & Kartini Ludwig | 7 PM\nJoin Caroline Pegram and Kartini Ludwig as they chart the evolving fusion of music and machines, from the early days of algorithmic composition to today\u2019s rise of generative sound factories. This session offers a clear foundation on how AI models are steering creative approaches, authorship, and performance and looks at the rise and possible uses of creative & cultural foundation models.\u00a0The talk will extend beyond reflection, challenging attendees to consider how we might intentionally design fair and sustainable futures for music, where machines amplify and augment human creativity. There\u2019ll be fresh insights, critical questions, and an invitation to rethink what it means to compose and create in an age of sonic mutation. \n2\u00ba: An Immersive Sonic Performance |\u00a0Tarun Balani & Parizad D | 8 PM\n2\u00b0 is a live audio-visual performance by drummer\u2013composer Tarun Balani and visual artist Parizad D that shares stories and messages about the artists\u2019 experience of climate change.\u00a0The performance unfolds through shifting sonic textures, experimental ambient sounds and immersive visual worlds inviting the audiences to deeply listen and inhabit these worlds. As a part of the performance audiences are encouraged to reflect, share and contribute their own climate change stories and messages on postcards \u2014linking sound and touch\u2014creating a sensory dialogue.\u00a02\u00b0 serves as a reminder that every story and every voice matters and our individual stories have the power to begin conversations about climate equity, justice, and our shared responsibility to reimagine the future of our world. \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences.

    "description": "Humour and elegance share the stage!\u00a0 \nLakshmi Girish and Parvathi Jayaram, a newly formed duo, explore a classical form through a modern lens. Inspired by the Subhashitha Ratnabhandagaram, this performance offers a satirical retelling of an encounter between two mischievous monkey wives and Seetha, reframing an epic moment through humour and surprise.\u00a0 \nThis evening showcases a rarely explored comic register of Mohiniyattam: hasyam. Synonymous with grace and lyricism, Mohiniyattam here is choreographed with a refreshing perspective. Live music featuring mizhavu, vocals, edakka, and flute deepens the rhythmic and narrative play.\u00a0 \nMusicians:\nMizhavu (Kerala\u2019s ancient drum) \u2013 Kalamandalam Ratheesh Bhas (Kerala,India)\nEdakka \u2013 Kalamandalam Sarod Kumar (Kerala, India)\nFlute \u2013 Rakesh Dath (Bangalore, India)\nLive carnatic vocals \u2013 Harshitha Vidya (Bangalore, India)\nNattuvangam \u2013 Vinaya Narayanan (Bangalore, India) \nSupported by: \n \n",
