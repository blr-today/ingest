    "description": "Francis Newton Souza, one of the most provocative and unflinching voices in modern Indian art, challenged the conventions of both European and Indian art traditions. In her new book F.N. Souza: The Archetypal Artist, academic and art critic Janeita Singh offers a deeply interdisciplinary reading of Souza\u2019s life and work, drawing on Jungian analysis, mythology, religion, and philosophy, to examine how Souza confronted the collective unconscious through his art. \nIn this session, she presents the key ideas from her book and then engages in a conversation with art historian Annapurna Garimella to explore how Souza\u2019s expressionism defied colonial and religious authority, reclaimed the fragmented self, and questioned the ideological foundations of modernism. Together, they will reflect on the urgency of rethinking art history from decolonial and non-Western perspectives, and how Souza\u2019s work, with its blend of eroticism, irreverence, and rage, continues to challenge dominant narratives of aesthetics, identity, and power. \nThe conversation will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "15 minutes | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 | India \nHuliyappa is a short documentary in Kannada by first-time filmmaker, Sourabha Rao. Shot entirely in the remote hamlets of the Uttara Kannada district, the film is centred around an ancient custom of worshipping the eponymous tiger deity during Deepavali, for the protection of people and their livestock from large Carnivora \u2013 tigers, leopards and bears. \nThe film reveals the losses faced by the residents of this thickly forested Western Ghats landscape to themselves and their prized cattle due to incidents with wildlife, and the surprising tolerance, forgiveness and compassion that prevail in people despite them. It is an exploration of the mythical, emotional and rational origins of the remarkable faith. Through conversations with people from various strata of the local society, including scholars, farmers and cowherds, Rao makes a concise and compelling retelling of a culture that has maintained the unlikeliest harmony between humans and wildlife in the region for centuries, and documents the simple rituals that constitute it. \nRather soberingly, Huliyappa is also a timely reminder of the dire need to impress such indigenous practices upon a generation increasingly disconnected from its roots, if the equilibrium with Nature, so pivotal to the future of humanity, is to be vouchsafed. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with the team that made the film, in conversation with Sonu Venugopal.

    "description": "Older than the Himalayas, the Deccan is the oldest geological formation of the Indian subcontinent. Endemic species, some found nowhere else on earth, once inhabited this landscape, teeming with wildlife. Gently undulating plains of endless grasslands and savannah, rocky thorn and scrub jungles, and riverine and riparian ecosystems, were rich with an amazing biodiversity of flora and fauna. Tigers roamed and Asiatic Cheetah hunted Black Buck in high-speed chases across the plains. From Dung Beetles to Sloth Bears, from the Great Indian Bustard to Caracals, from millions of migratory birds arriving in winter, to wild flora rich with life-giving sustenance, this was the Deccan. From the unbearable heat of summer, to the welcome monsoons, the land was vibrant. From cool winters to a short spring, culture and nature tell stories of millions of years of evolution.\u00a0 \nFast forward to today, and the reality of the effects of unsustainable development. Loss of habitat, rampant illegal wildlife trade, roadkill, conflict with the grassroots level stakeholders, have all taken a heavy toll. We have lost most of our pristine wilderness and over half of our flora and fauna. \nThis presentation will take the audience through a view of the past, present and future of the Deccan landscape. It will include the work of the Deccan Conservation Foundation as para ecologists, preserving, protecting and conserving the last remaining isolated, unprotected habitats and wilderness, with a focus on the Indian Wolf, the apex predator, and other associated species. \nImage Credit: All photos by Indrajeet Ghorpade. \nPresented by the Deccan Conservation Foundation. \n \n",
