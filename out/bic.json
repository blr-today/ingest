    "description": "What makes a city uniquely itself? Is it its geography, history, location, demographic? Is it its leaders, influencers, inspirations? Or is it something else, an undefinable but palpable spirit, wrought over centuries of a combination of all these, that seeps into the soil and charges the air, infecting residents and visitors alike? \nTwo decades of exploring, discovering, researching \u2013 and reading, writing, and talking \u2013 about her hometown have convinced\u00a0Roopa\u00a0Pai, author, columnist, and co-founder of the heritage walks and tours company, BangaloreWalks, that the latter is true \u2013 cities are neither born nor made, they\u00a0become. Her collection of evocative essays on the city have\u00a0now been compiled into a book, Becoming Bangalore, published by Hachette India. \nIn her conversation with Brinda S Narayan,\u00a0Roopa\u00a0will dive into the city\u2019s history to tease out bits of the Bangalore jigsaw \u2013 a chieftain\u2019s decision, a Commissioner\u2019s inclusiveness, a scientist\u2019s quest for excellence, a Dewan\u2019s conviction, a missionary\u2019s zeal, a Maharani\u2019s foresight,\u00a0an entrepreneur\u2019s vision, an industrialist\u2019s generosity, an activist\u2019s passion, a common man\u2019s ambition, a writer\u2019s pride in his language \u2013 in an effort to track down the genesis of Bangalore\u2019s modern, progressive, liberal spirit. \nWhat she hopes will emerge from that discussion are tantalizing\u00a0hints that\u00a0reveal how a little 16th\u00a0century settlement on a hill became India\u2019s most charismatic city. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Roopa Pai will be in conversation with Brinda S. Narayan.

    "description": "This session offers a deep and reflective exploration of India\u2019s journey toward self-reliance in defence research and development, inspired by the DRDO publication \u201cEndeavours in Self-Reliance: Defence Research 1983\u20132018\u201d, by KG Narayanan. The book captures a critical period of transformation in India\u2019s defence landscape, chronicling key achievements, institutional efforts, and the steady march toward technological autonomy over three and a half decades. \nThe session will open with a keynote presentation by Mr. Narayanan, who will outline the central themes and insights drawn from the book. This includes the evolution of DRDO\u2019s role, the emergence of indigenous capabilities, and the broader strategic imperative of self-reliance in defence. The presentation will set the stage for a nuanced conversation about the motivations, challenges, and breakthroughs that have defined India\u2019s R&D efforts in the defence sector. \nFollowing the keynote, a panel discussion will bring together eminent voices who have been closely involved in shaping this journey. Dr Samir V. Kamat, Chairman DRDO and Secretary, Department of Defence R&D; Dr S. Christopher, former Chairman DRDO; and Dr Anantha Krishnan M, senior defence journalist and author, will engage in a dynamic exchange of perspectives. The discussion will be moderated by Air Marshal (Retd.) P Rajkumar, providing context and continuity across decades of institutional memory and technological evolution. \nTogether, the panel will reflect not only on past achievements but also on the pressing needs and strategic directions for the future, offering valuable insights into what it will take to secure and sustain a truly self-reliant defence ecosystem in India. \n",

    "description": "Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India\u2019s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of \u2018direct benefits\u2019 which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session, Louise Tillin, the author of the book, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "45 minutes |\u00a0English, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi with English subtitles | 2004 \nAs part of BIC\u2019s Pride Programs, this session will include a screening of T Jayashree\u2019s Many People, Many Desires, followed by a panel discussion with T Jayashree, Mira Brunner and Siddharth Narrain. \nMany People, Many Desires is centered around the interviews of many members of the LGBTQ community in Bangalore at the time. The film was shot entirely in a MiniDV tape format. Starting from an exploration of sexuality and human rights, it allows the viewer to hear the first-person narratives of some of those who were engaged with the sexuality movement of the time \u2013 whose work is instrumental for the fight for legal rights for queer people in India. \nUsing legal discrimination against sexual minorities as its starting point, the film explores the relationship between class, sexuality, and gender. The film captures early years in the movement against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial law which criminalized homosexual behavior and has now, through efforts which included some of those interviewed in the film, been read down. \nThe panel will talk about what has changed, what has remained the same, and QAMRA\u2019s (the Queer Archive of Memory, Reflection, and Activism) attempts to preserve this history. They will discuss their perspectives on archiving queer material and the responsibilities of preserving what is still in living memory. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis year, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is \u2014 unconforming, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression.

    "description": "This two-piece contemporary dance performance explores the body\u2019s inner battles and breakthroughs. While one piece unravels self-doubt; the other captures the pulse of transformation. \nMetamorphosis \nThe dancers explore the reactions of what happens when one goes through the process of transformation. How does one\u2019s body\u2019s senses and feelings react through this unending loop between creation of new patterns, destruction, and recreation of one another. Metamorphosis dives deep into the question of how a pattern impacts the body? And during the period of transition when old patterns are fading away and the new self is finding its expression in the world, what is then your relationship to the changed self, and how does your body respond to this change? What is this new self? Is it an add-on to the old pattern or a breakaway into something new? \nLost in Oscillation \nThis piece carries us into the surreal world of self-doubt; shifting, strange, and deeply personal. The dancer moves through a dreamlike space, where self-doubt becomes a physical presence that twists the body and unsettles the mind. Reflections fragment across the stage, echoing the dancer\u2019s inner conflict. Movements swing between sharp tension and quiet stillness, capturing the push and pull of uncertainty. With haunting sound and abstract visuals, the piece invites you into a world where even your own reflection feels unfamiliar. It\u2019s not just a performance\u2014it\u2019s a glimpse into the shifting terrain of the self. \nThe peformance will be followed by a short interaction with the audience. \nSupported by: \n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "What happens when the promise of equal citizenship begins to fade for one of the world\u2019s largest Muslim populations? In today\u2019s India, the question is no longer theoretical, but urgent and deeply personal for over 200 million people. \nThis session explores the shifting political landscape of Indian Muslims through the lens of Shikwa-e-Hind, the new book by political scientist Mujibur Rehman. He examines what he calls their \u201cthird political moment,\u201d a phase marked by the erosion of constitutional equality and the rise of a majoritarian ethos since 2014. Tracing the arc from the aftermath of 1857, through the hopeful vision of 1947, to today\u2019s polarised climate, Rehman invites a critical look at the future of democratic participation for Indian Muslims. \nThe conversation features Mujibur Rehman in dialogue with author and columnist Aakar Patel and moderated by journalist Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed. They will explore the tension between constitutional ideals and majoritarian pressures, the structural challenges of representation, and the possibilities for reclaiming dignity, rights, and democratic participation for Indian Muslims. The session will conclude with a Q&A, offering space for your questions in what promises to be an inclusive and engaging discussion. \n",

    "description": "Tarana and Thillana\u2014two strikingly vibrant forms in Hindustani and Carnatic classical traditions\u2014share more than just syllabic play and rhythmic flair. Yet, they are often misunderstood, conflated, or heard in isolation. \nThis workshop invites participants to explore the shared pulse and divergent expressions of these two forms. Through live demonstrations, guided listening, and cross-cultural comparison, we will experience the same raga unfold as a Tarana and a Thillana, tracing how it transforms in structure, tempo, and mood across styles. \nThe session will introduce key rhythmic devices like layakari, jatis, and tihais, explore improvisation techniques in each tradition, and unpack the role of these forms in both concert and dance settings. Alongside a deep listening experience, participants will also gain a historical understanding of how Tarana and Thillana evolved and how they continue to be shaped by performance and pedagogy today. \nLed by expert practitioners from both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions, this workshop is designed for listeners, learners, dancers, and musicians alike\u2014anyone curious to hear, feel, and understand rhythm as language and lineage. \n",
