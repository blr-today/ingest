    "description": "Scholars of international relations, political thought, and India\u2019s diplomatic history continue to debate the meaning and relevance of non-alignment in India\u2019s foreign policy today. The origins of these debates lie in Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s articulation of non-alignment at the height of the Cold War, a concept both resolute and ambiguous. \nIn this talk, Dr. Swapna Kona Nayudu will draw on her acclaimed book, The Nehru Years: An International History of Indian Non-Alignment (Cambridge University Press UK, Juggernaut Books India), to explore how India\u2019s approach to international affairs and the United Nations now understood in summary as non-alignment. Based on meticulous archival research in multiple languages, her work uncovers India\u2019s diplomatic and peacekeeping contributions in pivotal global events such as the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Hungarian Revolution, and the Congo Crisis. \nTracing the evolution of non-alignment from Nehru\u2019s time to the present, Dr. Kona Nayudu will examine its contested meaning and its influence on India\u2019s position as the only non-aligned founding member of the UN. \nDr. Kona Nayudu will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

Through literature, oral testimony, archives, or immersive media, each speaker has engaged with histories marked by silence, trauma, and survival. In this session, they will reflect on the choices they have made \u2013 whose voices to amplify, how to tell different stories with care, and how to avoid reducing complex truths into simplified narratives. \nAt the heart of this conversation is a shared responsibility \u2013 not only as writers, educators, or artists, but as individuals shaped by inherited memory. How do we move beyond binaries of victim and perpetrator? How do we honour truths without exploitation or erasure? How and what does one embrace and acknowledge? \nAs Partition fades from lived memory, this panel asks how the stories we carry today might shape the understanding of future generations, and the ways they remember, question, and imagine. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "Step into a heartfelt journey across time and tradition. In this special performance, the untouched poetic gems of Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharathiyar are brought to life, exploring the vision and passion behind words he once held close. \nOur story begins with the late Prof. K. V. Krishnan from Varanasi, Bharathiyar\u2019s own nephew, whose lifelong love for his uncle\u2019s work unearthed these hidden verses. Through his research, we glimpse Bharathiyar not only as a poet but as a dreamer, lighting fires of change. \nThe name Bharathi, born of the Sanskrit \u201cAbh\u0101y\u0101m + Ratah\u201d, means \u201cone who delights in fearlessness.\u201d This performance honors him as a beacon of courage, his words as arms of inspiration. \nThis evening offers a warm celebration of dance and verse; a simple yet powerful tribute to our fiery national poet, whose voice still stirs hearts today. \nCredits \nMusic Direction \u2013 Dr. Rajkumar Bharathi\nVocal & Nattuvangam \u2013 Swati Athmanathan\nMridangam, Tabla & Voiceover \u2013 Sri.

With his signature blend of wit, warmth, and wild storytelling, Anuvab moves from the absurdities of colonial hangovers to the chaotic charm of startups, social media spats, and airline adventures. \nThis isn\u2019t just a stand-up show; it\u2019s a cultural joyride. After sold-out performances in 11 countries and 27 cities, Anuvab now brings back his international tales, asking: what happens when India\u2019s inside jokes meet the world\u2019s outside gaze? \nPraised as \u201chysterically funny\u201d by Time Out and \u201cbrilliant\u201d by the Hindustan Times, Anuvab\u2019s satire strikes a chord with audiences of all ages. Whether you\u2019re nostalgic for Doordarshan or deep into meme culture, his humour finds you and welcomes you in. \nIt\u2019s one evening, many Indias, and more than a few unexpected truths as punchlines. \n",

    "description": "There are many different views on what it means to be free. One popular perspective sees freedom as a form of independence: being free means not being held back or restricted by the expectations, obligations, or interference from others. After explaining the basic idea in more detail, the talk discusses Bob Dylan\u2019s work to illustrate the value of this kind of freedom while noting that some other parts of Dylan\u2019s work seem to question this very idea of freedom. To explore the critique of freedom, the talk turns to Robert Musil\u2019s (1880-1942) unfinished novel The Man Without Qualities. One way to understand this celebrated novel is to see it as a partly hilarious, partly deeply tragic and moving description of putting too much emphasis on an ideal of freedom as independence. Drawing on insights from moral philosophy, the talk suggests that a proper understanding of the relation between independence and personal integrity can lead to a better appreciation of freedom as independence. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the lecture. \nThis lecture is a part of Vidyashilp University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "In Karnatik music, a composer is referred to as a \u2018vaggeyakara\u2019 \u2013 someone who creates both the text (vak) and the music (geya) for a composition. The kirtana is the most important compositional form in Karnatik music. It is a beautiful balance between the sahitya (text), raga (melody) and tala (rhythm). These kirtanas have sprung from the creative flow of melody and text, thus creating a unified aesthetic identity.\u00a0 \nThree eighteenth-century composers, Thyagaraja (1767-1847), Muthusvami Dikshithar (1775-1835) and Shyama Shastri (1762-1827), were masters and innovators of this compositional form, reverentially referred to as the \u2018Trinity\u2019 of Karnatik music. \nThe oldest among the three, Shyama Shastri, composed fewer compositions than his other two contemporaries, but each one of his compositions stand out as a unique piece. He used complex rhythmic structures which give a special quality to his kirtanas. \nThe prolific composer Thyagaraja viewed ragas with utmost clarity and definition. In his kirtanas, you find defined nuggets of the raga\u2019s phrases in almost every line. \nThe esoteric Muthusvami Dikshithar looked at a composition with a different lens. His kirtanas are one whole melodic movement where the raga flows in an unstructured manner, overflowing from one line to another. The deeper one dwells on his compositions, their beauty unravels. \nAt this concert, Sangeetha Sivakumar will be presenting compositions of the Trinity with a special focus on Muthusvami Dikshithar since we are celebrating his 250th birth anniversary this year. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Skandaanubhavam \u2013 The Inner World of Bliss Consciousness is a humble offering to Lord Muruga \u2013 the vibrant Tamil deity and to the literary world that has tried to capture his essence for centuries. This production is an artistic journey through Muruga\u2019s many stories and moods, as seen through the eyes of poets, saints, and seekers. Through the twin disciplines of Harikatha and Bharatanatyam, we bring to life not only the narratives but the emotions, dilemmas, and revelations that these stories carry. Harikatha, with its flowing rhythm and spoken word, sets the stage with historical, philosophical, and devotional context. Bharatanatyam, with its gestural beauty and powerful physicality, takes us deeper into the emotional landscape of the characters. This production is also rooted in the idea of \u201cAtma Anubhava\u201d\u2014the deeply personal, transformative experiences that poets and composers have shared in their devotion to Lord Muruga. It is these experiences that make ancient stories timeless, that allow us to feel a 12th-century poet\u2019s longing or a saint\u2019s moment of revelation. \nCredits \nArtistic Director: Acharya Anitha Guha\nResource Consultant & Harikatha: Suchithra B\nVocals: Sriranjani Tapasya Santhanagopalan\nNattuvangam:\u00a0Jayashree Ramanathan\nMridangam and Rhythmic Composition:\u00a0Raam Shankar Babu\nViolin:\u00a0Eashwar Ramakrishnan\nFlute:\u00a0Sruti Sagar\nMusic Interludes and Jathi Composition:\u00a0Vijay Kumar\nLighting Design:\u00a0Surya Rao\nSkandaanubhavam Logo and Invite Design: Avanti Natarajan (Art Brew) \nSupported by: \n \n",

It is more than a group of musicians gathered to perform a piece of music; it is a living metaphor for what society could be \u2014 and perhaps what it must be, if we are to thrive together\u2026\u00a0This metaphor becomes even more powerful in today\u2019s world, where individualism often overshadows community, and noise threatens to replace music.

In this timely and wide-ranging session, Peter Varghese, former Australian Foreign Secretary and High Commissioner to India, offers a perspective shaped by decades of diplomacy and deep engagement with the region. \nHis address will explore the complex forces redefining the Indo-Pacific: from the sharpening rivalry between the US and China, to China\u2019s expanding influence and the evolving policy direction in Washington. The session will also examine how key regional players (India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia) are shaping their own responses to these pressures, and what this means for the broader security of the region. \nAlongside geopolitics, the conversation will turn to trade tensions, economic nationalism, and the slowing pace of globalization; factors that now cast long shadows over our economic future. Can traditional regional institutions hold, or will more agile, interest-based minilateral groups take their place? \nFollowing his presentation, Peter Varghese will converse with Latha Reddy, Nitin Pai, and Ranjan Mathai. The evening concludes with an audience Q&A, inviting reflections on a region that will shape the 21st century. \n",

    "description": "Language: English \nWhen the rules of love are rewritten, what\u2019s left standing? \nDario Fo\u2019s The Open Couple is a bold, sharp, and darkly comic exploration of modern relationships pushed to the edge. What begins as a provocative experiment (a husband proposing an open marriage) quickly spirals into chaos, confrontation, and unexpected revelations. \nSet against the backdrop of shifting gender roles and social expectations, the play peels back the layers of a marriage unravelling. With biting wit and disarming vulnerability, Fo exposes the emotional toll of jealousy, the absurdity of control, and the fragile line between freedom and fear. The couple\u2019s battles are fast, funny, and painfully familiar, as they try to navigate the messy terrain of love, power, and identity. \nThrough its rapid dialogue and theatrical twists, The Open Couple holds up a mirror to our ideas of commitment and connection; asking what we\u2019re really seeking when we ask for more. \nA deeply human comedy that leaves room for both laughter and reckoning. \nCredits:\nWriter : Dario Fo\nDirector : Faraz Khan\nCreative Producer : Ragini Roychowdhury\nActors : Vaishali Bisht & Rohan Joshi\nSound : Charvi Ojha \nSupported by:\n \n",

At its center is Hirayama, played with quiet brilliance by Cannes 2023 Best Actor Koji Yakusho. He finds peace and purpose in the rhythms of his days: tending to the city\u2019s public toilets, listening to old cassette tapes, reading paperbacks, and capturing light through a camera lens. \nBut beneath his seemingly simple routine lies a life shaped by memory, mystery, and choice. As gentle disruptions begin to ripple through his orderly world, we\u2019re invited into a meditation on solitude, dignity, and the invisible richness of everyday existence. \nWenders, long admired for his contemplative, human-centered cinema, draws inspiration from Ozu while offering a rare, unromanticized view of Tokyo; one that honours its quiet workers and fleeting beauty. With a nostalgic soundtrack and a deeply empathetic gaze, Perfect Days is a film that lingers long after it ends. \nNominated for Best International Film at the 96th Academy Awards, this is a cinematic poem for anyone who\u2019s ever found meaning in a daily ritual, or longed to. \nWim Wenders, born in 1945, is a celebrated German filmmaker and a leading voice of New German Cinema. Rising to prominence in the 1970s, he is known for his deeply human films and visual storytelling across fiction, documentary, photography, and writing. A former film critic and co-founder of Filmverlag der Autoren, Wenders gained early acclaim with The American Friend and his iconic road movie trilogy. He won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes for Paris, Texas and earned Oscar nominations for Buena Vista Social Club and Pina. His work continues to shape global cinema with emotional depth and artistic innovation. \nThis is the second film in our collaboration with MUBI. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience! \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",
