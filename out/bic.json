    "description": "What happens when two classical dance forms meet on the same stage? \nRooted in tradition, yet distinct in rhythm and grace, the fourth evening of Dual Margam brings together two iconic forms: the flowing, emotive elegance of Mohiniyattam from Kerala, and the sculptural strength and expressive clarity of Odissi from Odisha. \nEach solo performance offers a glimpse into the soul of its tradition\u2014Mohiniyattam with its gentle, circular grace; Odissi with its striking lines and powerful storytelling. The evening culminates in a duet, weaving these two styles into a graceful confluence, illuminating their shared roots and individual brilliance in a spellbinding visual dialogue. \nWhether you\u2019re a longtime admirer of classical dance or simply curious, this is a rare chance to experience movement as language, emotion, and shared heritage. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Presented by CFRIA, the book Deevara Chittara \u2013 The Art, the People and their Culture \u2013 is the first of its kind to archive and document indigenous folk art Chittara and related depleting eco-friendly handicrafts.\u00a0 \nThe outcome of a two-year intense field work and research, this book documents Chittara, its versatility and the local Malenadu culture it is rooted in, with a special focus on the Deevaru community women who have refined it into an intricate art. It addresses the dearth of resources on Chittara, essential to keep this living tradition alive. The book informs the reader of the various facets of the art form \u2014 its intricacies, symbolism, use of natural materials, the role of women in the art, its link to social customs like marriages and festivals \u2014 of which Chittara is an integral part. The book makes creative use of related folk songs, proverbs and riddles. It is a valuable and comprehensive resource on one of the most refined folk art practices in our country. \nCFRIA is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and revival of Chittara, an intricate folk art practiced by the women of the Deevaru community in the Malenadu region of Karnataka. The organisation has spent the last 20 years working closely with artisans from this region to preserve and celebrate this sacred and intricate mural art form.\u00a0 \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Contradictions, comparison and ultimately confluence, Dvaita | Duality\u00a0is a fusion of artistic expression and philosophical inquiry. Through two distinct dance forms, Kuchipudi and Balinese, the dynamic balance of opposing energies is beautifully displayed. \nCentred around \u2018Ardhanareeswara\u2019, the composite form of Shiva-Shakti, the dance visualises the distinct yet complementary nature of the masculine and feminine energies. A layered performance, this piece explores the philosophical questions of how our consciousness (Purusha) interacts with the material world (Prakriti). \nThis evening aspires to resolve the paradox of opposites not through negotiation, but harmonious expression. \nCredits: \nConcept, Creation and Artistic Direction: Gomathi Boorada \nDancers:\nGomathi Boorada\nJesitta Jilju\nNeharika Renjith Nair\nHemali Subramanyam Boorada\nAlphonsa Ashwajit Kamble\nSneha Chandrababu\nGoutham Maheswaran\n\u2060Ni Putu Widiantini\n\u2060Ni Wayan Pia Wahyuni\n\u2060Ni Komang Erna Sriwahyuni\n\u2060Ni Kadek Santi Wiadnyani \nMusic:\nI Wayan Sudirana / Gamelan Yugananda\nD.S.V.

    "description": "Why does welfare feel out of reach for so many, even as governments promise more than ever? \nWelfare schemes and cash transfers are central to India\u2019s political economy today. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recounts the crucial history of how welfare has evolved in India over the past century. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks important questions, illuminates failures and brings clarity to our murky future. \nAuthor Louise Tillin in conversation with Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan, moderated by Arun Thiruvengadam, will explore what India\u2019s welfare journey means for citizens, workers, and voters today. \nCurious about where your taxes go, or why support doesn\u2019t always reach those who need it most? Stay for the Q&A and bring your questions. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "From boasting of a lone International Master (IM) in Manuel Aaron in 1962, India has come a long way in the world of chess, particularly in the last two-and-half decades of the new Millennium. Today, India has 85 Grandmasters, including three women, 23 Woman Grand Masters, 140 International Masters and 42 Woman International Masters while the list of FIDE masters is growing by the day. \nIn the top 10 of any category or age group, Indians figure so prominently that they are second only to the US and China in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s section respectively. The double-gold at the 2024 Olympiad and India\u2019s superb performance in the Candidates added to its growing reputation as a superpower. \nBut if you look from an historic perspective, our champions of today are merely continuing the legacy of a 5,000-year-old tradition which can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization when chess (called Chaturanga then) was, among other things, used for war stimulation. \nAccording to legend, Ravan\u2019s wife Mandodari taught him Chaturanga so that he could plan battle strategies. Later, Chaturanga became Chatrang in Persian and Shatranj in Arabic before travelling to Spain and the rest of the western world. In the modern era, chess is looked at in different ways. A gymnasium of the mind. A cerebral tug-of-war. \nFor India, Anand can be the best reference point to start any debate involving chess. In fact, Indian chess can be neatly divided into Pre-Anand and Post-Anand eras.\u00a0The Pre-Anand period was nascent with not many players around, no infrastructure to talk about or any support from the government or the private sector. Indian chess style was one of the many variants of the official chess as recognized by the ruling body FIDE. By the time Anand became India\u2019s first Grandmaster in 1987 and triggered the post-Anand era, chess was a rapidly growing sport. Let\u2019s look at some figures. Till the start of the new Millennium, India had just three GMs with Dibyendu Barua (1991) and Pravin Thipsay (1997) following in the footsteps of Anand. The first decade of the new century produced 20 GMs and the next 10 a staggering 44. The present decade has already witnessed 16 GMs to take the tally to 85. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, MS Thej Kumar, Aravind Shastry, Manisha Mohite and Saritha M Reddy will be in conversation with Vijay Mruthyunjaya. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in May 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Overcast, Audible, and Amazon Music. \n",

    "description": "The solitude of the night-time has always been a space where humans release their innermost thoughts, whether of comfort, terror, liberation, wistfulness or hope. As such, many of the finest works of art have been inspired by its thrall. Karl Lutchmayer\u2019s recital discusses and presents some powerful emotional responses to the darkness by a quintet of composer-pianists who represent a pantheon of Romantic and Modernist ethea. From yearning lullabies, intimate reminiscences, and nocturnal soundscapes to religious ecstasy, and gothic horror, each showcases the extraordinary resources of the piano and the technical and emotional range of the pianist\u2019s art. \n \n\u00a0 \nImage Credit: \nThumbnail, Header and Poster: Photos of Karl Lutchmayer by Param Singh \n\u00a0 \nPresented by the International Music and Arts Society \n \n\u00a0 \nWith the support of Furtados and Steinway \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\u00a0 \nThe International Music and Arts Society gratefully acknowledges the support of Shashi Uthappa and V Natarajan. \n",

    "description": "Presented by Chinmayi Nrithyalaya and directed by Guru Sridevi Chalagalla Mungara, Chandalika is a Kuchipudi interpretation of Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s poignant dance drama. The work traces the emotional and spiritual journey of a young woman marked by caste, and the internal revolution sparked by a single act of compassion. \nAt its heart, Chandalika is a meditation on identity, longing, and liberation. The narrative unfolds through Kuchipudi\u2019s deeply expressive vocabulary, drawing on graceful movement, rhythmic command, and layered abhinaya to illuminate the character\u2019s awakening from inherited exclusion to personal agency. \nPerformed in Telugu with English framing, the ballet invites all audiences into a world where social realities and inner transformation meet. It is a classical work, yet quietly radical, reimagining traditional form as a lens for reflection on dignity, desire, and the human condition. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Diabetes is a major epidemic in India with an estimated 77 million people suffering from it and nearly 25 million who are prediabetic. It is a silent killer, leading to significantly higher risks of heart disease, strokes and kidney failures. And most people who have it, experience helplessness when attempting to reverse or control it. \nBut what if there was a way for each and every individual to combat this challenge? What if we could turn around diabetes with less medication, right from within the daily rhythm of our lives? \nThis session explores exactly that. Drawing on insights from Turn Around Diabetes, the discussion will challenge the myths that keep India stuck in a reactive cycle of care. It will open up a deeper, science-backed conversation: How can we shift the trajectory of chronic illness management by equipping people with the tools to intervene early and meaningfully? \nAuthor Roshani Sanghani will be in conversation with Rahul Matthan, who has personally committed to transforming his life using an approach that does not need medication. Together, they will reflect on how clarity and knowledge, rather than fear and misinformation, can empower individuals and families to take charge of their health journeys. \nThe conversation will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Dr. B. R. Ambedkar is remembered and admired for many things: for his heroic, lifelong, campaign to eradicate the evil of untouchability; for his scholarly contributions as an economist and social theorist; for the social movements he led and the political parties he founded; for the educational institutions he nurtured; for his critical role in overseeing and directing the framing of the Constitution; for the brilliant books, essays and pamphlets that he authored on a variety of subjects. \nThis lecture will focus on Ambedkar as a visionary and deeply insightful theorist of constitutional democracy. By juxtaposing what he said in his speeches in the Constituent Assembly to the social and political realities of contemporary India, I shall demonstrate how his ideas remain of compelling relevance to us today. While the core of the talk will be on Ambedkar the political theorist, it will end by briefly comparing his legacy with that of other remarkable Indians of his generation, such as Nehru, Gandhi, Tagore, and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay. \nThe National Law School of India University, Bengaluru (NLSIU) and the Ahmadi Foundation have entered into a MoU to set up the Justice Ahmadi Initiative on Rule of Law, Democracy, and Social Justice in honour of, and to preserve and promote the legacy of former Chief Justice of India, Justice Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi. The Initiative will work to advance the ideas that Justice Ahmadi championed throughout his distinguished career, including but not restricted to human rights, education, inclusion and protection of vulnerable communities, judicial independence, alternate dispute resolution mechanisms, and strengthening of democratic institutions. An annual distinguished lecture series is one of the events planned under the Initiative. Read more about it here. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "All About Nothing is a solo performance that weaves prose, movement, and melody into a\u00a0poetic inquiry on the illusions we cling to, especially those shaped by love. Through the lens of\u00a0Maya, the piece explores how the idea of love, particularly the romantic kind, can so thoroughly\u00a0consume us that we begin to believe we cannot live without it. But in that entanglement arises a\u00a0deeper question: Is this true love, or just the most convincing illusion we\u2019ve created? \nWhat begins as a personal narrative unfolds into a philosophical reflection on the emotional\u00a0architecture we build around relationships, identity, and truth. Through an intimate conversation\u00a0between two artists, the work gradually exposes the fragile layers of perception we live\u00a0within\u2014possessions, routines, emotions, roles\u2014ultimately revealing their impermanence. \nAt the heart of the piece lies a paradox: there is nothing, yet there is everything. And perhaps in\u00a0that contradiction, we discover a strange kind of freedom.\u00a0Inspired by the words of Butoh master Kazuo Ohno, who said, \u201cYou must have life coming out of\u00a0you (your art),\u201d this piece is not performed, but lived. \nAll About Nothing offers both tenderness and confrontation, inviting viewers to reflect on their own\u00a0attachments and to question what they hold dear, and why. \nCredits:\nWritten & Conceptualized by: Archana S Kumar, India\nOriginal Soundscore: Kamal Singh, Bangalore, India\nDramaturgy & Lighting: Sal Yusuf, UK | India (Black Box India) \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "The Chittara art form practised by the Deevaru Community is engaged primarily by the women folk of the community as a socio-cultural practice. Nestled in the ranges of verdant western ghats of North Canara live the Deevaru people, a matriarchal-agrarian community of nature-worshippers, residing in and around Sagara, Karnataka. Chittara art has become an integral part of their daily routines. It was never a profession, but a practice that has artistic and socio-cultural value. For women of the Deevaru community Chittara paintings are a source of great joy, beauty and creativity. For painting, women artists use eco-friendly natural resources like ground rice paste for white, charred rice for black, powdered Gurige seeds for yellow, and soil/earth for red. \nIn this workshop, you will learn to draw a few motifs of Chittara along with their description. You can then draw these on a small cane tray to take home to. You will also get to know how natural paints are used in this art along with the eco-friendly handicrafts they make. \nWhat will you take home?\nKnowing the socio-cultural aspects of the community\nLearn a folk art form of Karnataka\nCompleted piece of artwork done by yourself \nWhat do you need to bring?\nWater bottle to keep you hydrated.\nKindly get a note book/notepad, a pencil, an eraser and a rag cloth.\nNote: Other essential materials will be provided by the host. \nCenter for Revival of Indigenous Art (CFRIA), founded by Ms Geetha Bhat, is a non-profit organisation working to preserve and promote Chittara folk art, Karnataka. CFRIA has showcased events, Lec-dems, workshops at various educational, cultural institutions, and exhibitions. Chittara murals can be witnessed at Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA) Indian Music Experience (IME) Bosch, Taneira showrooms to name a few. CFRIA is now working on the Chittara folk art Archival book, which aims to address the dearth of resources on Chittara, essential for its preservation.

    "description": "The Western Ghats enjoyed a central place in the life and science of cytogeneticist E. K. Janaki Ammal (1897-1984). To her, the dense and tall tropical evergreen forests found here was the epitome of climax vegetation in India, or the mature stage of ecological succession. In order to understand how this balance was reached and stability attained, she undertook a grand and pioneering project\u2014 a study of the relationship between peoples and plants of the region, both in deep history and the immediate present. One of her chief aims was the making of a modern and decolonialised version of the Hortus Malabaricus\u2014 a new compendium of medicinal plants from the Western Ghats, reordered on the basis of chromosomes, and containing information on their uses, as gathered from the forest dwellers, who she believed were the primary interlocutors of indigenous medico-botanical knowledge. Also, quite tellingly, in her advancing years, rather than expend energy directly wrestling with the Kerala government on the Silent Valley issue, she championed for its conservation by mobilising international support and creatively embarked on an innovative project\u2014 the cytogenetics of the flora of these undisturbed forests. \nThis lecture is part of the\u00a0Obaid Siddiqi Lectures,\u00a0Annual lectures delivered by the Obaid Siddiqi Chair in the History and Culture of Science at the Archives at NCBS. \nImage credit: Thumbnail and Header Art by Megha Ramachandra \nIn collaboration with \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

This quiet, immersive performance centers around\u00a0narrative fragments, ambient audio, and subtle sensory cues that evoke personal and collective histories. \nPresented in an intimate, contemplative setting, Ehsaas is not theatre in the conventional sense \u2014 it is a space for listening, sensing, and remembering. Stories unfold through voice, texture, and sonic layering rather than action or spectacle. The work leans into silence as much as it does into sound, creating room for individual interpretation and emotional resonance. \nRooted in lived experience and artistic experimentation, Ehsaas invites the audience to witness \u2014 and be witnessed \u2014 through the intangible yet deeply felt realms of inner life.

    "description": "Indian paper money has a rich history, filled with numerous fascinating stories and unique aspects that reflect the country\u2019s diverse heritage and evolving economy. \nOne of the most remarkable pieces is the only surviving ancient paper note of India, which was circulated during the British colonial period. Equally significant is the first One Rupee note issued in 1917, marking the early stages of formal paper currency in the country. Among the rare denominations is the unusual Two and a Half Rupees note, which stands out for its distinct value and limited circulation. \nThe influence of foreign colonial powers is also evident in the paper money issued by the Portuguese and French in their respective territories in India. Additionally, several princely states across the subcontinent issued their own forms of paper currency, showcasing the regional autonomy and diversity of pre-independence India. \nOther intriguing aspects include the issuance of Prisoners of War Camp Money and the use of paper cash coupons as a substitute for currency in certain regions. A rare and noteworthy event in monetary history is the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s simultaneous issuance of currency notes for two different countries\u2014an occurrence seldom seen elsewhere. \nIndia has also seen the release of commemorative banknotes on a single known occasion, adding a unique dimension to its numismatic record. More recently, the 2016 demonetisation marked a historic turning point, acting as a catalyst for increased digital economy awareness and financial literacy across the nation. \nIn this session, Mr. Rezwan Razack dives into some fascinating anecdotes of Indian paper money. He\u2019ll also be in conversation with Ramjee Chandran about the evolving nature of currency in India. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Even by the early 1900s, Tibet remained largely unexplored. The area around Mount Kailash, in south-western Tibet, came to be better understood through the explorations of the Swede Sven Hedin, who, during an expedition between 1907 and 1909, discovered\u2014among other things\u2014the sources of the Brahmaputra, Indus, and Sutlej rivers. He measured the depth of Lake Manasarovar and also became the first white man to circumambulate the sacred mountain. Thirty years later, Swami Pranavananda explored the region and went on to publish articles and books that credibly criticized Hedin\u2019s identification of the rivers\u2019 sources, offering, for the first time, an informed Asian perspective on Tibet\u2019s geography. \nThis session retraces the journey of these two travelers\u2014 a Swedish explorer and an Indian ascetic\u2014 whose visits to the sacred Kailash-Manasarovar region in Tibet, decades apart, transformed it from a place of myth to a well-understood reality. Through archival material\u00a0accessed for the first time, juxtaposed against contemporary pictures, this visually rich talk examines the debates that arose between the two, to\u00a0recreate the story of how the modern understanding of this sacred landscape came to be. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",
