    "description": "Midlife is a phase when we find ourselves pulled in multiple directions\u2014across work, home, health, friendships, and hobbies. \nIn this session, Ravi Venkatesan delves into themes from Deepak Jayaraman\u2019s recent book, Play to Potential. The book offers a nuanced exploration of how to unlock human potential\u2014not just professionally but holistically\u2014by embracing life\u2019s highs and lows. Drawing from his acclaimed Play to Potential podcast and his experiences as a coach, Deepak introduces the FLAVOUR framework, a practical guide to navigating the intricate interplay of family, aspirations, values, and relationships. \nDeepak emphasises that life is a team sport, with family serving as an essential support system. He argues that personal growth and achievement are deeply intertwined with our family contexts, a perspective often overlooked in self-help literature, particularly in cultures where family plays a central role. \nA key insight of the book is the recognition that life unfolds in seasons, shaped by transitions\u2014some intentional, others unexpected. Using real-life examples and case studies, Deepak illustrates how navigating these transitions thoughtfully is vital to realising our potential. \nThis discussion will resonate with anyone in their 30s to 60s, offering valuable strategies to lead a multi-dimensional, purposeful life. \n",

    "description": "Being immune to the charms of poetry is a crime that is its own punishment, the Sanskritic tradition tells us. Join us as we discover the allure of Sanskrit and Prakrit love poetry and the travails of translating doe-eyes and elephant-thighs into English with Anusha Rao and Suhas Mahesh, co-translators of the verse anthology, How to Love in Sanskrit (HarperCollins 2024). \nHow to Love in Sanskrit is a poetic exploration of the maze of modern dating: flirting, daydreaming, yearning, and breaking up, through the eyes of Kalidasa, Bana, Vidya, and many other, often anonymous gifted poets. \nModerated by Radhika Chadha, the translators will discuss their inspiration for the book, their approach to translation, misconceptions about Sanskrit poetry, and the challenges of translating pre-modern poetry, drawing from both classic and forgotten texts to paint a picture of what love feels like in Sanskrit. The session will conclude with a reading of their favourite verses from the book. \n",

    "description": "Karnataka is one of India\u2019s most diverse states, as rich in literary and cultural traditions as it is in democratic struggles and political churns. The twentieth century witnessed the birth of a modern Kannada renaissance, accompanied by the emergence of a powerful social conscience. One young man\u2019s desire to explore this vibrant historical backyard, born out of a feeling of being linguistically unmoored, compounded by worries over an increasingly opaque political direction, leads to an ambitious\u2014no, audacious\u2014attempt to unpack the region\u2019s social and cultural histories. \nRama\u00a0Bhima\u00a0Soma\u00a0is an enterprise of translation and rediscovery, packed with stories and conversations. The life and times of legends like Kuvempu and Shivaram Karanth; the fall of Socialism and the rise of the Hindu Right; the intellectual ruminations of U.R. Ananthamurthy, D.R. Nagaraj and M.M. Kalburgi; the wildly popular television serials of T.N. Seetharam and the community-centred one-woman theatre shows of Du Saraswathi; a brief history of Naxalism in Karnataka and glimpses of other complicated legacies of the 1970s\u2019 Left\u2014the book explores a dizzyingly wide sweep of Karnataka\u2019s contemporary history, seeking, above all, to forge new connections and begin fresh conversations. \nMarshalling a diverse range of literary and scholarly resources, framed through biographical sketches and immersive reportage, this session will reanimate some pivotal moments in the making of modern Karnataka. \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Ancient Sanskrit literature mentions the veena as the instrument used to accompany vedic chants, very much like the organ that was used in the Roman catholic church for the Gregorian chants. The earliest instruments used grass reeds and animal guts as strings for plucking and the joke is that the musicians still use \u201cGrass\u201d. As music developed from folk to classical, desi and Marg Sangeeth, as described in ancient texts like Natya Shastra of\u00a0 Bharata Muni of the 3rd Century AD, and later Sarangadeva of the 11th Century, the sophistication of playing techniques has advanced. \nIn today\u2019s musical presentation , the audience will witness the use of hybrid electronic veenas as a part of this sophistication and progress, without watering down the gravity and authenticity of the musical form as described in voluminous texts on Indian classical music. \nArtists: \nShanthi Rao and Neeraja Krishnamurthy :Veena\nK.N.Uma Maheshwari :Keyboard\nN.Vasudeva : Mridangam\nSubba Rao :\u00a0Ghatam \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "In March 2020, when the world went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, poets and friends Marilyn Hacker and Karthika Nair\u2014living mere miles from each other, but separated by circumstance, and spurred by this strange time\u2014began a correspondence in verse. \n\u2018Renga\u2019, an ancient Japanese form of collaborative poetry, is comprised of alternating \u2018Tanka\u2019, beginning with the themes of \u2018Toki\u2019 and \u2018Toza\u2019: this season, this session. Here, from the \u201cplague spring\u201d, through a year in which seasons are marked by the waxing and waning of the virus, Hacker and Nair\u2019s Renga charts the \u201cdifferents and sames\u201d of a now-shared experience. \nTheir\u00a0poems witness a time of suspension in which some things, somehow, press on relentlessly, in which solidarity persists\u2014even thrives\u2014in the face of a strange new kind of isolation. Between \u201cten thousand, yes, minutes of Bones\u201d, there\u2019s cancer and chemotherapy and the aches of an ageing body. There is grief for the loss of friends nearby and concern for loved ones in the United States, Lebanon, and India. And there is a deep sense of shared humanity, where we all are \u201cmere atoms of water, each captained by protons of hydrogen, hurtling earthward.\u201d \nAt turns poignant and playful, the seasons and sessions of A Different Distance display the compassionate, collective wisdom of two women witnessing a singular moment in history. \nKarthika Nair will be in conversation with Prem Panicker.

    "description": "2023 | 80 mins | English with subtitles \nLink to the trailer. \nOver half a century ago, India embarked on a pioneering journey to safeguard its tigers. Since then, the world has lost two-thirds of its wildlife, and India\u2019s human population has surged to 1.4 billion. Yet, India\u2019s tiger population has more than doubled, and the country is now home to approximately 70% of the world\u2019s last wild tigers. \nHowever, the path to this extraordinary achievement has been far from straightforward. This film takes you into the backstage of India\u2019s biggest and most ambitious wildlife conservation journey, narrating some untold stories that formed their legacy. But this is more than just a story of conservation. It\u2019s a tale of hope, resilience, and the bond between nature and the Indians. \nThe film showcases how the project has evolved over five decades, highlighting not only the triumphs but also the setbacks, controversies, and compromises made along the way. With an in-depth look at the complexities of tiger conservation, right from political challenges to poaching pressures, you will gain a deeper understanding of the immense efforts required to protect this iconic species. The film also sheds light on the steps needed to ensure that tigers continue to roam freely in India\u2019s forests for generations to come. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A session with the film\u2019s producer, Kalyan Varma. \n",

    "description": "The text of Kuvempu\u2019s epic Kannada novel,\u00a0Malegalalli Madumagalu\u00a0(1967), and the recent translation,\u00a0Bride in the Hills\u00a0by Vanamala Viswanatha (Penguin Random House, 2024), will be discussed by an eminent panel of scholars, writers and the translator. \nSet in 1893 in the Malnad region of the Western Ghats with its majestic Sahyadri ranges, dense forests, and river Tunga, Kuvempu\u2019s\u00a0Malegalalli Madumagalu\u00a0(Bride in the Hills) describes the saga of not one young woman but many, of varied hues, who aspire for love and fulfilment in marriage, in a self-serving, male feudal order. An organic network of interrelated stories, the well-known Kannada writer Devanoora Mahadeva locates the novel in the epic tradition of the Mahabharata and Tolstoy\u2019s\u00a0War and Peace. This woman-centric text weaves together the touching plight of young couples in love, such as Gutti and Timmi, from a Dalit community living on the ghats; Aita and Pinchalu, migrant labourers from below the ghats, and Mukundayya and Chinnamma from the land-owning Shudra caste. Fired from within by their love\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the most powerful agent of change\u00a0\u2013\u00a0these young people seek a life of freedom and dignity, leading to the transformation of the larger community. Their heartening stories are juxtaposed against the travails of hapless Nagakka and scheming Venkatanna, sickly Deyi and brute Chinkra, and gullible Kaveri and lecherous Devayya. All of them are, in different ways, up against the repressive regimes of the decadent landlords, who manipulate traditional feudal practices as well as the modern apparatus of a colonial state. \nTrue to its claim as an epic novel, Kuvempu\u2019s text with its multiple narrative strands vividly enacts its mission statement in the epigraph: \u201cHere, no one is important; no one is unimportant; nothing is insignificant!\u201d Every sentient and insentient thing \u2013 the degenerate Chinkra, orphan Dharmu, Huliya the dog, Biri the cat, the evergreen forest, the Hulikal Peak \u2013 has a place and a purpose in this narrative. Imbued with an ecological consciousness, the novel offers a veritable biodiversity register of the Malnad region.\u00a0Kuvempu presents a \u2018view from below\u2019, a subaltern perspective which also takes in the world of the wealthy and powerful. \nWinner of the first Sahitya Akademi award in 1955 and the Jnanpith in 1967, Kuvempu (Kuppali Venkatappa Puttappa 1904-1994) inaugurated the non-brahmin era in modern Kannada writing. Kuvempu\u2019s versatile oeuvre includes a vast body of poetry, plays, novels, children\u2019s writing, essays and an autobiography. While his poetic epic \u2018Shri Ramayana Darshanam\u2019\u00a0is a radical rewriting of the Valmiki epic drawing from the Jaina tradition, the two novels,\u00a0The Kanur House\u00a0(made into a film by Girish Karnad) and\u00a0Bride in the Hills, are modern novels set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Inspired by Tolstoy\u2019s expansive canvas and Tagore\u2019s unique Indian ethos, this first significant Shudra writer and an iconic figure in Kannada culture, has sculpted an entirely regional epic novel in\u00a0Bride in the Hills. \nImage Credits\nBook Cover: MS Murthy and Jay Gosney\nHeader: A Malnad Landscape, Photo courtesy Girish Kasaravalli\nPhoto of Amit Chaudhuri by Richard Lofthouse/University of Oxford \nIn collaboration with Rashtrakavi Kuvempu Pratishthana, Kuppali (Devangi, Thirthahalli, Shivamogga) \n \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Vanamala Viswanathan, Rajendra Chenni, Amit Chaudhuri and Arvind Narrain will be in conversation.

Atre was also a pioneer in popularising the Indian classical music in the West, giving her first performance abroad in 1969. \nJoin Padmini Rao, one of Prabhaji\u2019s senior-most students, as she takes you on a journey, sharing personal experiences interspersed with musical interludes. A journey, through the Guru-Shishya landscape as it formed and evolved over the years. Get an inside glimpse into the world of Prabhaji\u2019s approach to the fascinating process of musical creativity and development of the artistic temperament, which cemented her position as one of the foremost exponents in the world of Hindustani Classical Music. \nThis concert is held in remembrance of Dr. Prabha Atre, marking one year since her passing on January 13, 2024. \nSupported by: \n \n",
