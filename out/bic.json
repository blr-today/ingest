    "description": "Institutions and Public Policy for India\u2019s Sustainable Development \u2013 Perspectives on Governance, Technology, and Finance, is an edited volume in honour of Professor Vinod Vyasulu (Edited by \u2013 Sukhpal Singh, Jyotsna Jha, A. Indira and A. V. Arunkumar). \nThe book addresses one of the most urgent challenges of our time \u2013 sustainable development. Across the globe economies are grappling with the combined pressures of climate change, inequality, and unsustainable growth. Basic needs remain unmet for large sections of the population, prompting a growing recognition that we must rethink how we define and pursue development. Sustainability is no longer a peripheral concern\u2014it is central, complex, and evolving, requiring new approaches and frameworks. \nThe book brings together diverse perspectives on the critical drivers of sustainable development, namely, governance through institutions, readiness through technology and accessibility to finance. While technology is often seen as a key enabler, its transformative potential depends deeply on the institutional and policy environment in which it is embedded. Institutions\u2014formal and informal\u2014shape development outcomes, and public policy plays a crucial role in aligning these efforts with sustainability goals. \nFocusing on the Indian context, the book event will have eminent panel members exploring the three interconnected themes of (1) Institutions and Development; (2) Technology and Innovation; and (3) Policy and Governance. \nWe look forward to an engaging conversation as we reflect on the ideas in the volume and their relevance for policy, research, and practice. \n",

    "description": "The years between ages 10 and 19 are marked by intense physiological, psychological, and social change. Adding to the challenges of this already turbulent phase are mobile devices and social media. These platforms often exploit insecurities, creating echo chambers and negative feedback loops. While digital life can connect us, it also has the power to isolate. The TV series Adolescence highlights the potentially dangerous consequences of these overlapping forces. \nIn this conversation, a panel of experts, drawing from both professional knowledge and lived experience, explores what adolescence looks like in the age of social media, particularly in urban India. Taking the TV show as a starting point, the discussion will look at the realities young people face today and consider how parents, schools, and other adults can help support individual and collective well-being. \n",

    "description": "In the 1940s, a rebellious teenager tore through the bustling lanes of Surat\u2019s Dawoodi Bohra mohalla on his rickety bicycle, noisily jangling his rusty bell. Obsessed with cricket, mischief and pranks, nobody could have predicted then that young Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi would one day stride across the glittering halls of the Rashtrapati Bhavan to swear in as the third Muslim Chief Justice of India. \nThis is the story of Justice A.M. Ahmadi \u201426th Chief Justice of India \u2014 who served during some of India\u2019s most turbulent political and legal moments. From his powerful dissent in the Babri Masjid case as he withstood immense political pressures, the fight for federalism in S R Bommai to his extraordinary courage in the unforgettable General Vaidya assassination case, his legacy is remembered for safeguarding democracy and the social fabric of our nation.\u00a0 \nBut beyond the courtroom, his story is also one of personal struggles and conviction\u2014navigating a world often hostile to religious minorities, protecting others from the same, or confronting difficult questions of identity and dissent within his own community. For Justice Ahmadi, secularism wasn\u2019t just a legal principle\u2014it was a way of life. \nPart biography, part legal history, and part family memoir\u2014 this book, written by Justice Ahmadi\u2019s granddaughter, is a journey through the corridors of power and an unflinching portrait of a man who dared to speak truth to power no matter the consequences.\u00a0 \nIn this session, author and journalist Insiyah Vahanvaty speaks with senior advocate and legal scholar Aditya Sondhi about her deeply personal and powerfully political biography,\u00a0The Fearless Judge:The Life and Times of Justice A M Ahmadi.

    "description": "Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India\u2019s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of \u2018direct benefits\u2019 which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session, Louise Tillin, the author of the book, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Abhang is a genre of\u00a0classical\u00a0music from Maharashtra, primarily sung in praise of\u00a0Sri\u00a0Vitthala of Pandharpur. The term Abhang means no ending or no interruption. Over 10,000 Abhangs were composed by various Sants of Maharashtra, including Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Eknath, Sant Tukaram, Sant Namdev, and Sant Janabhai. Emerging from the Bhakti Sampradaya in the 12th century, Abhangs have become integral to Concerts and Bhajans. Varkaris (devotees of Sri Vitthala) sing Abhangs while walking towards Pandharpur. Sri.\u00a0Purandaradasa adopted the name \u2018Purandara Vitthala\u2019 as his ankitanama, as \u2018Vitthala\u2019 was his Ishta Murti, while the name \u2018Purandara\u2019 was bestowed upon him by his guru, Sri Vyasa Raya. \nUma Kumar, Carnatic Singer from Switzerland, and\u00a0the ensemble\u00a0will perform 12 Abhangs composed by 10 composers, set in 12 different Hindustani ragas and presented in both on-beat and off-beat rhythms.\u00a0She\u00a0will render these Abhangs in the Carnatic style, accompanied by Violin and Mridangam,\u00a0while complementing the sound with\u00a0Tabla and\u00a0Manjira to fully express these divine compositions\u2019 deep emotions. \nAbhang Mela aims to create a musical symphony, blending the bhava from singing, the nada from the Violin, the laya from the Tabla and Mridangam, and the high-pitched rhythms from the Manjira, alongside the melodious sound of the Tanpura. Music lovers are invited to enjoy this unique musical experience. \nPresented by: \nUma Kumar \n",

    "description": "How do we each feel a Raga? While Western classical music often associates major scales with happiness and minor scales with sadness, Indian Ragas evoke a wide spectrum of emotions\u2014unique to each listener. Could a Raga that brings joy to one person stir a different emotion in another? \nIs there hidden information in the space between two notes? While the twelve notes of the well-tempered scale were standardized only in the 18th century, Indian classical music has long embraced microtones\u2014subtle pitches between the familiar notes. Can the human mind truly perceive these shades of sound? \nAnd must we always stay within the bounds of musical grammar? What happens when we take a set of notes and let them breathe, transform, and find their own flow? \nThis World Music Day, join us for Insta-Ragam\u2014an immersive exploration of Raga structures, followed by a live session where you get to make music with the artists. \nSupported by: \n \n",

It vividly illustrates the rich cultural diversity, economic prosperity, spiritual and religious intensity of the region. \nIn the late thirteenth century, Marco Polo, along with his father and uncle, travelled from Venice to the court of Kublai Khan before heading south to India. There, he documented the thriving Pandya Kingdom in Thanjavur, known for its pearl trade, well-structured society, and beautiful temples, as well as the spice-laden markets of Kerala and the bustling port of Cambay in Gujarat, Western India. \nFast-forward over a century, and we have Niccol\u00f2 de\u2019 Conti, who provided a detailed account of India\u2019s Deccan region.

    "description": "Raaga music is the core essence of Indian classical music. It is not just a set of swaras/notes but a flow of melodic content, defined by certain contours which gives each raga s unique flavor. \nUnique relationships exist between the notes. While individual notes define a swara position, the reflection of the swara relationship expounds the melodic variations. \nHence it is essential to understand these relationships and how they flower into a raaga. While manodharma (creativity) has a big part in it, our huge repository of compositions plays an important role in providing a framework for this exploration. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Tarana and Thillana\u2014two strikingly vibrant forms in Hindustani and Carnatic classical traditions\u2014share more than just syllabic play and rhythmic flair. Yet, they are often misunderstood, conflated, or heard in isolation. \nThis workshop invites participants to explore the shared pulse and divergent expressions of these two forms. Through live demonstrations, guided listening, and cross-cultural comparison, we will experience the same raga unfold as a Tarana and a Thillana, tracing how it transforms in structure, tempo, and mood across styles. \nThe session will introduce key rhythmic devices like layakari, jatis, and tihais, explore improvisation techniques in each tradition, and unpack the role of these forms in both concert and dance settings. Alongside a deep listening experience, participants will also gain a historical understanding of how Tarana and Thillana evolved and how they continue to be shaped by performance and pedagogy today. \nLed by expert practitioners from both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions, this workshop is designed for listeners, learners, dancers, and musicians alike\u2014anyone curious to hear, feel, and understand rhythm as language and lineage. \n",
