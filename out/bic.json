Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends\u2026 Yet, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together, drifting apart, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth?

    "description": "90 Minutes | Kannada\u00a0 \nYogi Mattu Bhogi is a free adaptation of the 7th-century play, Bhagavadajjukam (Sanskrit, \u2018bhagavat\u2019 \u2013 hermit; \u2018ajjuka\u2019 \u2013 harlot), also known in English as The Ascetic and The Courtesan. One of the oldest surviving plays in Sanskrit literature, it is a fine example of a \u2018prahasana\u2019, or farce. Layered in witty exchanges about dharma, it is centered around the transmigration of souls between the two titular characters leading to confusion and chaos for the supporting characters who have no answer to the absurdity of it all. \nThrough this retelling in Kannada, Mahesh Dattani, plays around with the idea of gender: its expression, perception, spectrum and the exploration of what one truly is with a confrontation of stereotypes using humour and catharsis. Infused with Yakshagana, the play comes alive when the classic Sanskrit text and the physicality of theatre gels seamlessly with the traditional dance theatre form from coastal Karnataka. \nCredits:\nAdaptation and Direction:\u00a0Mahesh Dattani\nKannada Translation: Vishvajith Madhavamurthy\nYakshagana Choreography:\u00a0Guru Bannanje Sanjeev Suvarna\nMusic Composition:\u00a0Poornima Bhojraj\nSet Design: Mahesh Dattani\nLight Design: Trisha Shetty, Bhavya Bharadwaj, Pallavi Kodagu\nLights Execution: Trisha Shetty, Bhavya Bharadwaj\nCostume Design: Shruti Bangera\nMusic: Amrit P\nProduction Manager: Venumadhav Bhat\n(Initial) Poster Design: Gopalkrishna Bhat\n(Initial) Poster Artwork:\u00a0Shruti Bangera\nAssistant Directors: Trisha Shetty and Kritika Verma\nProduction Assistants: Atharv Mishra and Amrutha \nAbout Punaha Theatre:\nPunaha, a theatre company based in Udupi, is dedicated to the art of storytelling through the transformative power of performance. \u2018Punaha\u2019, is derived from the Kannada\u00a0(\u03a3\u0ca8\u0c83), Hindi (\u092a\u0941\u0928\u0903) and Sanskrit word, meaning \u201crepeat,\u201d or \u201cto do it again\u201d. They are a group of professional theatre artists, academicians, and working professionals who love theatre, and the idea of repetition and riyaaz involved in it. \u2018Punaha\u2019 symbolizes their commitment to revisit and reimagine classic narratives while exploring contemporary themes that resonate with today\u2019s audience. It also is the idea of us as humans trying, failing but definitely starting again, starting Punaha.\u00a0Among their ongoing productions are Girish Karnad\u2019s Agni Aur Barkha (translated into Hindi by Ram Gopal Bajaj) and Harold Pinter\u2019s The Caretaker. Agni Aur Barkha was previously adapted to the stage in Kannada as Agni Mattu Male. Yogi Mattu Bhogi is our fourth production overall in collaboration with Sahitya Akademi awardee, Mahesh Dattani. Punaha hopes to create a thriving theatre culture in the small coastal city of Udupi, develop their plays thriftily and tour them to other cities, big and small. Reflecting the multilinguistic atmosphere of the city, their intention is to not be bound by the constraints of a single language, producing plays primarily in English, Hindi, and Kannada. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n \n",

Sathyu as his second feature after \u201cGarm Hava.\u201d The film premiered at the International Film Festival of India and achieved both critical and commercial success during its 1989 theatrical release, completing a 100-day run. The film features an ensemble cast including Anant Nag, Shabana Azmi (in her Kannada debut), and Amol Palekar. \nSet in 1920s India, the story follows Kanneshwara Rama, a defiant peasant who becomes a legendary outlaw after confronting local injustice.

Among the most complex works of Karnad, it is based on the myth of Yavakri from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, and is an innovative reimagining of the epic\u2019s characters and events a retelling of a lesser-known episode from the epic in which the Khandava forest is burned down by Agni, the fire god, with the help of Arjuna and Krishna to provide a sacrificial alter. \nKarnad combines multiple myths to explore contemporary social, cultural, political, and psychological issues. Symbolism and allegories add to the depth of its narrative, making it a thought-provoking yet visually stunning experience. Known for its play-within-the-play method to depict the deception of brothers against brothers and fratricide and its timeless themes, the play continues to remain a significant work in the field of Indian theater and has been performed in multiple languages and at numerous theatre festivals. \nDirector \u2013 Abhinav Grover\nLights \u2013 Trisha Shetty\nSound \u2013 Amrit\nCostumes, Make up & Set Design -Shruti Bangera\nAssistant Director \u2013\u00a0Trisha Shetty \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "A symphony of brilliance, HH Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar, the 25th and last Maharaja of Mysore, transcended the throne. More than a king, he was a polymath, his reign a testament to the harmonious blend of administrative acumen and artistic fervor. His love for music transcended borders, encompassing both the rich tradition of Carnatic music and the elegance of Western classical. \nCrowned amidst the tempestuous winds of change, he navigated turbulent times with a visionary\u2019s zeal. He upheld the legacy of Mysore with an unwavering dignity, his reign a beacon of honor and integrity. When the dawn of Indian Independence broke, he gracefully relinquished his crown, a statesman who paved the path for the unification of princely states into the nascent nation. \nHis humility, a rare jewel in the crown of royalty, remains an enduring testament to his character. Though time may have dimmed the spotlight, the echoes of his extraordinary life and the profound impact of his reign continue to reverberate through the heart of Mysore, where he forever remains a beloved, though tragically unsung, hero. \nThe session will start with a 10 minutes film about\u00a0HH Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar, created by MAYA Films. This will be followed by a talk by\u00a0Dr. Sudhamani in Kannada.\u00a0Dr. Deepti Navaratna will deliver a talk on the musical genius of the Maharaja in English. A discussion between\u00a0Dr. Sudhamani, Dr. Deepti and Maya Chandra will follow. The session will end with a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Of all regions of India, the Deccan has the most diverse architectural traditions, nowhere better shown than in the variety of stone temples sponsored under a succession of dynasties which ruled peninsular India over some 700 years. To illustrate this unique diversity, Michell explores religious monuments at lesser-known sites. He begins with Early Chalukya temples overlooking the Tungabhadra river at Alampur, and ends with the imposing Kakatiya monument at the out of the way village of Palampet, both in Telangana. In between, he discusses the Nolamaba period shrines at Nandi and Shravana Belgola, and those of the Later Chalukyas at Sudi, Kuruvatti and Lakkundi, all in Karnataka. He concludes with the little visited Hoysala period shrines at Belavadi, Mosale and Agraha Bachhahalli. \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A Session with the audience. \nImage credit \u2013 Surendra Kumar \nIn collaboration with:\n\u00a0 \n",
