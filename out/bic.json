    "description": "49 mins | Hindi with English subtitles | 2019 | India \nIn a quiet village outside Delhi, two sisters grow old without growing tired. \nSet in Lahra, this tender documentary follows 86- and 93-year-old widowed sisters who have chosen a slower pace and fuller life in a village far from the noise of the city. With creaky knees and sharp tongues, they navigate their days with walkers and wit. Unapologetic, unhurried, and largely unbothered by the looming presence of age or death. \nTheir closest companions are not blood relatives, but their adopted family of domestic help. Together, they share a rhythm of television, sun-soaked afternoons, casual gossip, and everyday caregiving. Shot by their niece visiting for the first time, the film captures this unusual household with quiet affection and a light, observant eye. \nIn their unassuming way, the sisters offer a radical lesson: that talking openly about death can make life more meaningful. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmaker and producer. \nFilm Trailer \n",

    "description": "How do we\u00a0represent those who peopled Indian agrarian history? \nThese talks explore the place of oral narrative in reconstructing India\u2019s post-Independence agricultural history, especially some of its less known though no less defining moments. As important as watershed events and policy interventions are to the making of agrarian history, the contributions of other actors, among them landless agricultural\u00a0workers, peasants, political workers and agricultural scientists, must also be given their place. The perceptions of agrarian change as evaluated and voiced by those who made significant contributions to the course of agrarian history makes for a more textured view of social and economic change in rural India. \nThrough first-hand accounts from the lab and\u00a0the field we see how individual experience and social context shaped the making of agrarian history in\u00a0India after independence. These stories don\u2019t just add detail; they shift perspective, showing how knowledge and change emerge through lived realities. \nParvathi Menon, former Resident Editor of\u00a0The Hindu, and historian of science Sandipan Baksi will share insights from two major oral history projects, moderated by Madhura Swaminathan of the Indian Statistical Institute. \nAn invitation to listen closely to the stories that have shaped our reality today. \nThis discussion is part of the 69th edition of the Archives Public Lecture Series, which focuses on explorations in and around the archives at NCBS. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n",

It\u2019s about discovering what makes Storytelling Theatre unique: how content is shaped, how performances are crafted, and how the actor\u2019s body, voice, and presence become the entire stage. \nBangalore Little Theatre (BLT) offers a fresh take on this timeless craft with their unique Courtyard Programme. Here, stories come alive not on grand stages, but in the intimate spaces of living rooms, courtyards, or anywhere close enough to feel the heartbeat of the tale. \nWith just one or two actors, no sets or costumes, the magic is powered by performance and narrative. This minimalist approach demands a special kind of storytelling skill; a blend of precise scripting and deeply engaging delivery. \nThis workshop invites participants to be part of an exciting evolution, and offers a chance to explore how stories can transform spaces and connect people in new, unexpected ways. \nWhether you\u2019re familiar with BLT\u2019s Robi\u2019s Garden or Shakespeare By Any Other Name, this workshop offers a rare glimpse into the craft behind the charm. \nStep into the circle, and help shape the future of storytelling theatre. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

It will be led by Prof. Vijay Padaki, who has initiated the Courtyard Theatre form in Bangalore. To conclude the workshop there will be a full performance of one of the Courtyard plays. It will be open to the public. \nCourtyard Theatre is a Storytelling form of theatre in which we have just two actors presenting a whole play. A recent play in the series is about the man called Shakespeare \u2013 his life and work and the times when Shakespeare\u2019s plays originated. Shakespeare By Any Other Name aims to put across the \u201cidea of Shakespeare\u201d and dips into excerpts of scenes to illustrate the point. The script also raises the question of who Shakespeare really was and the authorship of the plays. \nThe play is meant to be educational, but is also good entertainment first. It may be performed in a variety of spaces, not necessarily in auditoria. The play has only two women on the cast, but draws on a great deal of audience participation. The storytellers are seasoned actors of BLT. The play is designed and directed by Vijay Padaki. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

The discussion will be moderated by Vasumathi Srinivasan, and will explore how the book gathers the experiences of Sherpas across generations\u2014guides, workers, climbers\u2014whose lives shaped the history of high-altitude mountaineering. \nThe book has received wide recognition, including the Climbing Writing Award at the Banff Mountain Film and Book Festival, Canada, 2024, the Boardman Tasker Award for Mountain Literature at Kendal Mountain Festival, UK 2024, the Kalinga Award for Non-Fiction, 2025, the Kekoo Naoroji Book Award for Mountain Writing, chosen by a panel of international mountaineers and writers, 2025, and the Indies Gold Medal in the Adventure Category, USA, 2025. It was also selected for the INDIES North America list of outstanding books by librarians and booksellers. Significantly, in its 42-year history, this is the first time the Boardman Tasker Award has honoured non-Western authors. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the discussion. \nIn collaboration with: \nThe Himalayan Club\nThe Himalayan Club, founded in 1928, is one of the earliest mountaineering clubs to have been established in the sub-continent for promotion of adventure and mountaineering. The club has presence across the country and outside too. The club\u2019s objectives is not confined to just mountain climbing but to a much wider range of interest and activities related to mountain world like publications, awards, lectures, social activities, sponsorships and mountain film festivals. First published in 1928, The Himalayan Journal (THj) has achieved a world -wide recognition as the most reliable reference on the Himalaya, Karakoram and the Hindukush.

    "description": "A voice shaped by tradition, carried forward with imagination. \nTrained in the revered lineages of the Gwalior, Jaipur, and Agra gharanas, vocalist Shiv Prasad Rao brings to life the timeless art of khayal gayaki. His music is a delicate balance: lyrical and intricate, contemplative yet deeply expressive, rooted in parampara but alive with improvisation. \nIn this performance, he presents traditional compositions in the styles of his gharanas, shaped by his own distinctive approach to lyrical and rhythmic improvisation. The result is not just your average recital, but an immersion into the evolving, ever-resonant world of Hindustani classical music. \nEnhancing this evening\u2019s performance are two remarkable artists whose journeys reflect equal dedication. Vighnesh Bhagavat Yellapur, Hindustani classical vocalist and harmonium player, brings a blend of rigour and sensitivity, enriching every raga with depth and clarity. On tabla, Kaustuv, channels a lifetime of rhythmic exploration. Praised for his precision and vitality, he anchors and elevates the music with subtlety and power. \nTogether, these artists create a tapestry of melody, rhythm, and improvisation\u2014an evening of Hindustani classical music where tradition meets spontaneity and rhythm flows seamlessly into melody. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "82 minutes | English | 2024 | India \nWhat does it mean to face the end on one\u2019s own terms\u2014and in the company of friends?\n\nA Fly on the Wall, directed by Nilesh Maniyar and Shonali Bose, traces the final chapter in the life of Chika Kapadia, framed through the intimate lens of friendship. In a quiet Swiss town, loved ones gather from across the world to raise a last toast, while a filmmaker friend documents the delicate passage between celebration and farewell. What unfolds is a tender meditation on choice, companionship, and the courage to define one\u2019s own ending. \nLayered with memory and emotion, the film draws viewers into a journey where the everyday collides with the profound, and where the act of bearing witness becomes as significant as the story itself. \nAfter the screening, directors Nilesh Maniyar and\u00a0Shonali Bose will be present for an in-person discussion with Sandhya Kumar, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \nCheck out the trailer here \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "The Masterclass Hegemony, Revolt and Selfhood: India\u2019s Encounters with Languages explores three defining moments in India\u2019s linguistic journey: the arrival of Sanskrit, Persian, and English. Each language came from beyond India\u2019s borders, gained a foothold, and extended its influence across diverse cultures, communities, and tongues. Their dominance shaped not only communication but also identity, politics, and thought. Thus, becoming inseparable from the larger story of India itself. \nThese lectures will trace how each language consolidated its power, how resistance took form, and how new voices emerged in the process. Strikingly, in every encounter, it was not the imperial language that endured, but the languages rooted in the soil (the desa, the nadu) that reshaped and redefined the cultural landscape. \nAs we step into an uncertain digital future, this series asks whether India\u2019s linguistic resilience will once again carry it forward, as it has so often before. \nSep 18 | Language and Hegemony | 6:30 PM\nExplore how Sanskrit, Persian, and English reshaped India across centuries. Each entered from outside, claimed cultural power, and ruled the imagination, but India remained a linguistic civilization defined by diversity. This talk uncovers why language became both a tool of hegemony and the essence of India\u2019s selfhood. \nSep 19 | Decline and Transformation | 6:30 PM\nSanskrit reigned for millennia, Persian for centuries, English for decades. Yet, none endured unchallenged. Each gave way to the resilient desi-bhashas, rooted in the land and people. This lecture traces the rise, fall, and transformation of languages in India, and what these shifts reveal about power and imagination. \nSep 20 | Language between Nationalism and Technology | 6:30 PM\nIn today\u2019s charged climate, languages carry the weight of both nationalism and digital futures. This session asks how India\u2019s linguistic diversity will evolve in the twenty-first century, and whether the voices of many can thrive amid the pulls of technology, identity, and the search for cultural belonging. \n",

The result is at once intimate and electrifying; a portrait of how timeless emotions find new bodies, new rhythms, and new voices. \nA rare chance to see tradition translated into modernity on stage! \nThis production was created through the 2023 Theatriculate Fellowship awarded by Adishakti Laboratory for Theatre Art Research. \nThis performance is part of a 9-city tour, with upcoming stops in Mumbai, Bhopal, and Pune. \nPlease Note:\n1.

More than a concert, the evening offers an immersion into mysticism itself. Music and poetry intertwine, creating spaces for reflection, wonder, and stillness.\u00a0 \nThis is a celebration of unity in diversity through the timeless legacies of Kabeer and Rumi that continue to awaken the eternal within us. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "From clay beds to concert halls, what stories does a pot carry? \nThe ghatam begins its life in mud drawn from ponds and lakes, spun carefully on a wheel by the potter\u2019s hand. Once fired, it waits quietly until a musician coaxes rhythm from its body.\u00a0 \nIn Song of the Clay Pot \u2013 My Journey with the Ghatam, Sumana Chandrashekar traces this remarkable journey, weaving together myth, history, and her own life as a ghatam artist. Along the way, she opens a window onto Carnatic music\u2019s hidden histories: from the instrument\u2019s early marginalisation and the years of AIR\u2019s harmonium ban, to the delicate hierarchies that shape relationships between performers. \nChandrashekar also reflects on being a woman in this world: the unspoken rules, the pressure to conform, and her conscious choice to step outside tradition\u2019s prescribed attire. \nIn conversation with Arundhati Ghosh, she invites us to consider not just the sound of the ghatam, but the politics, aesthetics, and lived experiences it holds within its clay. The discussion concludes with a Q&A. \nA morning where earth, music, and memory find rhythm together. \n",
