    "description": "What happens when two classical dance forms meet on the same stage? \nRooted in tradition, yet distinct in rhythm and grace, the fourth evening of Dual Margam brings together two iconic forms: the flowing, emotive elegance of Mohiniyattam from Kerala, and the sculptural strength and expressive clarity of Odissi from Odisha. \nEach solo performance offers a glimpse into the soul of its tradition\u2014Mohiniyattam with its gentle, circular grace; Odissi with its striking lines and powerful storytelling. The evening culminates in a duet, weaving these two styles into a graceful confluence, illuminating their shared roots and individual brilliance in a spellbinding visual dialogue. \nWhether you\u2019re a longtime admirer of classical dance or simply curious, this is a rare chance to experience movement as language, emotion, and shared heritage. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Presented by CFRIA, the book Deevara Chittara \u2013 The Art, the People and their Culture \u2013 is the first of its kind to archive and document indigenous folk art Chittara and related depleting eco-friendly handicrafts.\u00a0 \nThe outcome of a two-year intense field work and research, this book documents Chittara, its versatility and the local Malenadu culture it is rooted in, with a special focus on the Deevaru community women who have refined it into an intricate art. It addresses the dearth of resources on Chittara, essential to keep this living tradition alive. The book informs the reader of the various facets of the art form \u2014 its intricacies, symbolism, use of natural materials, the role of women in the art, its link to social customs like marriages and festivals \u2014 of which Chittara is an integral part. The book makes creative use of related folk songs, proverbs and riddles. It is a valuable and comprehensive resource on one of the most refined folk art practices in our country. \nCFRIA is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and revival of Chittara, an intricate folk art practiced by the women of the Deevaru community in the Malenadu region of Karnataka. The organisation has spent the last 20 years working closely with artisans from this region to preserve and celebrate this sacred and intricate mural art form.\u00a0 \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

Ferdinand Kittel (1832 \u2013 1903) was a missionary from Germany, who spent 50 years of his life between India and Germany on his work as a writer, translator, linguist and lexicographer. This period film takes up the journey of his monumental work in the fields of lexicography and philology. Despite many challenges, he mastered the Kannada language and created a huge dictionary and thesaurus unparalleled in any Indian language. He also taught in schools and produced more than 40 scholarly works. \nThis tri-lingual, non-fiction film is shot in locations where Kittel lived and worked both in southern India and Germany, and its first person narration uses his letters to his children in Germany, and letters and reports to superiors. It includes archival photographs dating back to the early 19th century, folk songs and poems written and translated by Kittel, and Old Kannada literature. The film has been shown in different parts of Switzerland, Germany & India. \nDuring the production of the film, one of the early print typefaces of Kannada, pioneered by Kittel and cast in Europe was digitised by the filmmaker, Prashant Pandit, and an open-source font in the name of Kittel was released for public use. This font was extensively used in the books published during the 1860s. The film also uses this font in the displayed texts. \nImage Credit\nHeader: Erstwhile Basel Mission Printing Press, Mangaluru, a still from the film, The Word and the Teacher.\u00a0Ferdinand Kittel supervised the publication of numerous books at the Press. \nProduction Crew:\nDirector, Writer & Editor \u2013 Prashant Pandit\nCinematography \u2013 Chidanand GL & Florina Steiner\nSound \u2013 Anand V & Mahaveer S \n",

Through two distinct dance forms, Kuchipudi and Balinese, the dynamic balance of opposing energies is beautifully displayed. \nCentred around \u2018Ardhanareeswara\u2019, the composite form of Shiva-Shakti, the dance visualises the distinct yet complementary nature of the masculine and feminine energies. A layered performance, this piece explores the philosophical questions of how our consciousness (Purusha) interacts with the material world (Prakriti). \nThis evening aspires to resolve the paradox of opposites not through negotiation, but harmonious expression. \nCredits: \nConcept, Creation and Artistic Direction: Gomathi Boorada \nDancers:\nGomathi Boorada\nJesitta Jilju\nNeharika Renjith Nair\nHemali Subramanyam Boorada\nAlphonsa Ashwajit Kamble\nSneha Chandrababu\nGoutham Maheswaran\n\u2060Ni Putu Widiantini\n\u2060Ni Wayan Pia Wahyuni\n\u2060Ni Komang Erna Sriwahyuni\n\u2060Ni Kadek Santi Wiadnyani \nMusic:\nI Wayan Sudirana / Gamelan Yugananda\nD.S.V.

Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recounts the crucial history of how welfare has evolved in India over the past century. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks important questions, illuminates failures and brings clarity to our murky future. \nAuthor Louise Tillin in conversation with Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan, moderated by Arun Thiruvengadam, will explore what India\u2019s welfare journey means for citizens, workers, and voters today. \nCurious about where your taxes go, or why support doesn\u2019t always reach those who need it most? Stay for the Q&A and bring your questions. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Presented by Chinmayi Nrithyalaya and directed by Guru Sridevi Chalagalla Mungara, Chandalika is a Kuchipudi interpretation of Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s poignant dance drama. The work traces the emotional and spiritual journey of a young woman marked by caste, and the internal revolution sparked by a single act of compassion. \nAt its heart, Chandalika is a meditation on identity, longing, and liberation. The narrative unfolds through Kuchipudi\u2019s deeply expressive vocabulary, drawing on graceful movement, rhythmic command, and layered abhinaya to illuminate the character\u2019s awakening from inherited exclusion to personal agency. \nPerformed in Telugu with English framing, the ballet invites all audiences into a world where social realities and inner transformation meet. It is a classical work, yet quietly radical, reimagining traditional form as a lens for reflection on dignity, desire, and the human condition. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Diabetes is a major epidemic in India with an estimated 77 million people suffering from it and nearly 25 million who are prediabetic. It is a silent killer, leading to significantly higher risks of heart disease, strokes and kidney failures. And most people who have it, experience helplessness when attempting to reverse or control it. \nBut what if there was a way for each and every individual to combat this challenge? What if we could turn around diabetes with less medication, right from within the daily rhythm of our lives? \nThis session explores exactly that. Drawing on insights from Turn Around Diabetes, the discussion will challenge the myths that keep India stuck in a reactive cycle of care. It will open up a deeper, science-backed conversation: How can we shift the trajectory of chronic illness management by equipping people with the tools to intervene early and meaningfully? \nAuthor Roshani Sanghani will be in conversation with Rahul Matthan, who has personally committed to transforming his life using an approach that does not need medication. Together, they will reflect on how clarity and knowledge, rather than fear and misinformation, can empower individuals and families to take charge of their health journeys. \nThe conversation will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Experience an unforgettable evening of music and memory with a special vinyl listening session of Kadahin Milandaasin, the acclaimed album by drummer and composer Tarun Balani. Called \u201ca sonic love letter to Sindh\u201d by The Hindu, this deeply personal work has been featured on NPR\u2019s Best Jazz Albums and Bandcamp\u2019s Best of Jazz. \nInspired by the life of Balani\u2019s late grandfather, K.S. Balani, a renowned Sindhi writer and painter, the album explores themes of migration, ancestral memory, and identity. Through moving compositions and layered soundscapes, Kadahin Milandaasin becomes both a tribute and a journey home. \nThe evening includes a full vinyl playback of the album, followed by an intimate conversation with Tarun Balani himself. Join us for a rare chance to hear the stories behind the music: of love, loss, and legacy.\u00a0 \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences.

    "description": "Experience the drama, passion, and romance of opera in a concert featuring timeless masterpieces from Bizet\u2019s Carmen, Verdi\u2019s La Traviata, and Gounod\u2019s Romeo and Juliet! \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra will be led by India-born Danish conductor Maria Badstue, and joined by stellar soloists\u2014Indian-American tenor Alok Kumar and soprano Cheryl Bains. This concert brings the emotional power of grand opera to life in Bengaluru. \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra brings together talented musicians from across the region to foster peace and unity through music. Inspired by Ambassador Nirupama Menon Rao\u2019s extensive years in diplomacy, the orchestra provides a platform to promote dialogue, cultural synergy, and friendly understanding. \nNirupama Rao,\u00a0Founder/ Trustee of The South Asian Symphony Foundation says, \u201cThere is something profoundly symbolic about an orchestra. It is more than a group of musicians gathered to perform a piece of music; it is a living metaphor for what society could be \u2014 and perhaps what it must be, if we are to thrive together\u2026\u00a0This metaphor becomes even more powerful in today\u2019s world, where individualism often overshadows community, and noise threatens to replace music. The orchestra reminds us that true greatness lies not in volume, but in harmony \u2014 in listening, adapting, and playing our part with care and respect.\u201d \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \n",

    "description": "All About Nothing is a solo performance that weaves prose, movement, and melody into a\u00a0poetic inquiry on the illusions we cling to, especially those shaped by love. Through the lens of\u00a0Maya, the piece explores how the idea of love, particularly the romantic kind, can so thoroughly\u00a0consume us that we begin to believe we cannot live without it. But in that entanglement arises a\u00a0deeper question: Is this true love, or just the most convincing illusion we\u2019ve created? \nWhat begins as a personal narrative unfolds into a philosophical reflection on the emotional\u00a0architecture we build around relationships, identity, and truth. Through an intimate conversation\u00a0between two artists, the work gradually exposes the fragile layers of perception we live\u00a0within\u2014possessions, routines, emotions, roles\u2014ultimately revealing their impermanence. \nAt the heart of the piece lies a paradox: there is nothing, yet there is everything. And perhaps in\u00a0that contradiction, we discover a strange kind of freedom.\u00a0Inspired by the words of Butoh master Kazuo Ohno, who said, \u201cYou must have life coming out of\u00a0you (your art),\u201d this piece is not performed, but lived. \nAll About Nothing offers both tenderness and confrontation, inviting viewers to reflect on their own\u00a0attachments and to question what they hold dear, and why. \nCredits:\nWritten & Conceptualized by: Archana S Kumar, India\nOriginal Soundscore: Kamal Singh, Bangalore, India\nDramaturgy & Lighting: Sal Yusuf, UK | India (Black Box India) \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "The Chittara art form practised by the Deevaru Community is engaged primarily by the women folk of the community as a socio-cultural practice. Nestled in the ranges of verdant western ghats of North Canara live the Deevaru people, a matriarchal-agrarian community of nature-worshippers, residing in and around Sagara, Karnataka. Chittara art has become an integral part of their daily routines. It was never a profession, but a practice that has artistic and socio-cultural value. For women of the Deevaru community Chittara paintings are a source of great joy, beauty and creativity. For painting, women artists use eco-friendly natural resources like ground rice paste for white, charred rice for black, powdered Gurige seeds for yellow, and soil/earth for red. \nIn this workshop, you will learn to draw a few motifs of Chittara along with their description. You can then draw these on a small cane tray to take home to. You will also get to know how natural paints are used in this art along with the eco-friendly handicrafts they make. \nWhat will you take home?\nKnowing the socio-cultural aspects of the community\nLearn a folk art form of Karnataka\nCompleted piece of artwork done by yourself \nWhat do you need to bring?\nWater bottle to keep you hydrated.\nKindly get a note book/notepad, a pencil, an eraser and a rag cloth.\nNote: Other essential materials will be provided by the host. \nCenter for Revival of Indigenous Art (CFRIA), founded by Ms Geetha Bhat, is a non-profit organisation working to preserve and promote Chittara folk art, Karnataka. CFRIA has showcased events, Lec-dems, workshops at various educational, cultural institutions, and exhibitions. Chittara murals can be witnessed at Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA) Indian Music Experience (IME) Bosch, Taneira showrooms to name a few. CFRIA is now working on the Chittara folk art Archival book, which aims to address the dearth of resources on Chittara, essential for its preservation.

present times from P. Lankesh\u2019s original \u201cKranthi Banthu Kranthi\u201d, first published in 1971. Although there has been a significant shift in the political and social climate, the fact that the roots of these issues have remained constant makes it feel almost natural. The original play, written during an era when socialism, communism and revolution were at their peak, still manages to capture and reflect the present political and social order. Team Kalavilasi has adapted the original to fit today\u2019s scenario, making it more relatable to the current generation while being mindful of the play\u2019s complex and sensitive aspects. \nThe play explores pressing issues such as the tyranny of capitalists, systemic interference, the opportunistic behavior of influencers for personal gain, the outrage of disempowered youth, the flood of opinions on social media, and how the media capitalizes on these dynamics. It engages the audience with these timely themes. \nThe question of what is right or wrong is subjective. Throughout the play, the characters make decisions they believe to be right, only to become trapped in the system\u2019s nuances, sparking curiosity in the audience. Woven with humor and satire, the play offers ample entertainment while provoking thought. \nCast and Crew | \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c97\u0ca3 \u0cae\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0cc1 \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0c82\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0c95 \u0cac\u0cb3\u0c97: \nVaishnavi | \u0cb5\u0cc8\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cb5\u0cbf\nMadhukar Hirisave | \u0cae\u0ca7\u0cc1\u0c95\u0cb0\u0ccd \u0cb9\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0cb8\u0cbe\u0cb5\u0cc6\nSiddaramu K | \u2060\u0cb8\u0cbf\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0ca6\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cc1 \u0c95\u0cc6\nNamitha Ramu | \u2060\u0ca8\u0cae\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cbe \u0cb0\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cc1\nPallavi Hegde | \u2060\u0caa\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cb5\u0cbf \u0cb9\u0cc6\u0c97\u0ca1\u0cc6\nHarsha Vardhan | \u2060\u0cb9\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb7 \u0cb5\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0ca7\u0ca8\u0ccd\nNarayan Badiger | \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0caf\u0ca3\u0ccd \u0cac\u0ca1\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc7\u0cb0\u0ccd\nNagaraj | \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c9c\u0ccd\nSuhas Srinivas | \u0cb8\u0cc1\u0cb9\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ccd \u0cb6\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cc0\u0ca8\u0cbf\u0cb5\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ccd\nAbhishek Chakrannavar | \u0c85\u0cad\u0cbf\u0cb7\u0cc7\u0c95 \u0c9a\u0c95\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0ca3\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cb5\u0cb0\nAbhinav Iyengar | \u0c85\u0cad\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0cb5\u0ccd \u0c85\u0caf\u0ccd\u0caf\u0c82\u0c97\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ccd \nBackground Music | \u0cb9\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0cc6 \u0cb8\u0c82\u0c97\u0cc0\u0ca4 : Sathya Radhakrishna | \u0cb8\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0caf \u0cb0\u0cbe\u0ca7\u0cbe\u0c95\u0cc3\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0ca3\nLighting Design | \u0cac\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0c95\u0cc1 \u0cb5\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0caf\u0cbe\u0cb8 : Manju Narayan | \u0cae\u0c82\u0c9c\u0cc1 \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0caf\u0ca3 & Surya | \u0cb8\u0cc2\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0caf\nCo-ordinator | \u0cb0\u0c82\u0c97 \u0ca8\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cb9\u0ca3\u0cc6 : Basavaraj Emmiyavar | \u0cac\u0cb8\u0cb5\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c9c \u0c8e\u0cae\u0ccd\u0cae\u0cbf\u0caf\u0cb5\u0cb0 \n\n\nSupported by:\n\n",

    "description": "For centuries, Tibet has remained a land of mystery. Though sacred to millions, Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar, were still wrapped in myth as recent as the 1900\u2019s. This session retraces the journey of two travelers, a Swedish explorer and an Indian ascetic, whose visits illuminated the mythical and sacred Kailash-Manasarovar region in Tibet. \nBetween 1907 and 1909, Swedish explorer Sven Hedin mapped the region. He traced the sources of the three great rivers \u2013 the Brahmaputra, Indus, and Sutlej \u2013 and became the first European to walk around Mount Kailash. Three decades later, Indian monk Swami Pranavananda arrived in the region. He offered a fresh view, challenging Hedin\u2019s identification of the rivers\u2019 sources, offering, for the first time, an informed Asian perspective on Tibet\u2019s geography. \nThis visually rich talk brings their stories to life. Rare archival material, contemporary photos, and new research reveal how these journeys shaped our understanding of a sacred landscape. \nThe Q&A after the session offers room for your participation \u2013 whether curious about history, travel, or sacred places. \n",

    "description": "What happens when the language we speak no longer fits who we are, or when it never quite did? \nIn this thought-provoking talk, writer and translator Rita Kothari invites us to reflect on the hidden languages of our lives: the ones we speak at home, inherit from our families, or carry quietly within us. While English may dominate our public conversations, Kothari reminds us that it rarely stands alone. Beneath its surface are other tongues, shaping how we think, feel, and belong. \nDrawing from personal stories and cultural insight, she explores how linguistic expression is deeply tied to identity and power. From subtle shifts in pronunciation to bold acts of embracing or rejecting a language, Kothari highlights how marginalised communities use language to resist dominant norms.\u00a0 \nKothari challenges us to see language not just as a system of grammar and rules, but as lived experience; fluid, intimate, and political. In doing so, she calls for a more inclusive understanding of how we speak and listen to one another. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session, offering space for conversation and reflection with your questions, your stories, and your own layers of language. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",
