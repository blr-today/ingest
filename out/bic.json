    "description": "Manthan is a performance that brings together, for the first time, two ancient art forms from opposite corners of India\u2014Kaavad storytelling from Rajasthan and Mohiniyattam dance from Kerala. Rooted in the myth of Samudra Manthan, the churning of the ocean, it unfolds as a series of seven symbolic \u2018manthans\u2019 or churnings, exploring what it means to be human\u2014psychologically, emotionally, philosophically, and socially. \nThe performance emerges from a long process of research, exploration, and experimentation. It weaves original writing, choreography, and music into a layered structure of stories within stories, drawing on Indian mythology alongside imagined and contemporary experiences. Themes of existence, duality, and the paradoxes of life surface through metaphor, movement, and voice. \nMohiniyattam, known for its fluidity and depth, brings grace and quiet power to the performance, while the rarely-seen Kaavad Katha\u2014supported by over six years of dedicated study\u2014offers a rich narrative tradition that is both visual and oral. The Kaavad box opens and closes like a book, revealing worlds within, as the dancer and storyteller move in and out of each other\u2019s rhythms. \nManthan holds space for the interplay of tradition and innovation, creating a performance that is reflective, immersive, and intimate. Rather than offering answers, it invites the audience into a shared space of reflection\u2014where stories, images, and movement gently churn beneath the surface.\u00a0The performance was first curated by Mayuri Upadhya and commissioned by Serendipity Arts Festival. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Gurudev and Bapu explores the extraordinary exchange of letters and ideas between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, set against the backdrop of the Indian freedom struggle. Over 25 years, their correspondence reveals sharp differences on key issues\u2014nationalism, civil disobedience, education\u2014but also unwavering respect and affection between the two. \nTheir dialogue reflects a time in India\u2019s history marked by thoughtful disagreement and political maturity\u2014offering insights into how principled dissent and mutual regard can coexist. \nBangalore Little Theatre was honoured to present early performances of the play at places closely associated with Gandhi and Tagore\u2014Sabarmati Ashram, Santiniketan (Visva Bharati), and Thakurbari-Jorasanko (Rabindra Bharati). It has also been staged for the President of India. \nAdapted from the internationally acclaimed production with over 130 performances in India and abroad, this staging promises a compelling reflection on two great minds and the values that shaped a nation.\u00a0This performance is a tribute to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s enduring legacy, presented around the time of his birth anniversary. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "From boasting of a lone International Master (IM) in Manuel Aaron in 1962, India has come a long way in the world of chess, particularly in the last two-and-half decades of the new Millennium. Today, India has 85 Grandmasters, including three women, 23 Woman Grand Masters, 140 International Masters and 42 Woman International Masters while the list of FIDE masters is growing by the day. \nIn the top 10 of any category or age group, Indians figure so prominently that they are second only to the US and China in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s section respectively. The double-gold at the 2024 Olympiad and India\u2019s superb performance in the Candidates added to its growing reputation as a superpower. \nBut if you look from an historic perspective, our champions of today are merely continuing the legacy of a 5,000-year-old tradition which can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization when chess (called Chaturanga then) was, among other things, used for war stimulation. \nAccording to legend, Ravan\u2019s wife Mandodari taught him Chaturanga so that he could plan battle strategies. Later, Chaturanga became Chatrang in Persian and Shatranj in Arabic before travelling to Spain and the rest of the western world. In the modern era, chess is looked at in different ways. A gymnasium of the mind. A cerebral tug-of-war. \nFor India, Anand can be the best reference point to start any debate involving chess. In fact, Indian chess can be neatly divided into Pre-Anand and Post-Anand eras.\u00a0The Pre-Anand period was nascent with not many players around, no infrastructure to talk about or any support from the government or the private sector. Indian chess style was one of the many variants of the official chess as recognized by the ruling body FIDE. By the time Anand became India\u2019s first Grandmaster in 1987 and triggered the post-Anand era, chess was a rapidly growing sport. Let\u2019s look at some figures. Till the start of the new Millennium, India had just three GMs with Dibyendu Barua (1991) and Pravin Thipsay (1997) following in the footsteps of Anand. The first decade of the new century produced 20 GMs and the next 10 a staggering 44. The present decade has already witnessed 16 GMs to take the tally to 85. \nToday\u2019s panel will discuss this phenomena and the reasons behind it, the personalities involved, look at the milestones crossed so far and the ones that are ahead as Indian chess passes through a Golden Era.\u00a0A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n\n",

Rooted in literature, poetry, and deep personal exploration, this Bharatanatyam solo presentation is the culmination of over two years of immersive research and creative engagement. \nThe performance opens with the mystical tale of Saraswathi, inspired by the book The Lost River, exploring whether the river still flows\u2014physically and spiritually. We then journey with Meerabai, who seeks her beloved Krishna through soulful bhajans marked by longing, devotion, and unanswered questions. Devaki\u2019s poignant voice follows, reflecting on the joys of motherhood she never fully experienced and her yearning to reclaim lost moments with her son, Krishna. The production concludes with Akka Mahadevi, whose powerful Vachanas guide us on a quest for liberation, echoing the eternal human desire for union and truth. \nEach piece is supported by evocative compositions, guided by literary scholars, and brought to life through thoughtful choreography. \nSupported by: \n \n",
