    "description": "97 minutes | Koli, Marathi and Hindi with English subtitles | 2023 | India \nAgainst the Tide follows Bombay fishermen Rakesh and Ganesh, both belonging to the indigenous Koli community and inheritors of a rich, ancestral knowledge system\u2014one that reads the sea through the moon and tides. Rakesh continues to place his faith in these traditional methods, while Ganesh embraces modern fishing technologies in search of more secure returns. As climate change renders the sea increasingly unpredictable, the pressure to provide for their families begins to fracture their once-unshakeable friendship. \nA deeply human story set against the vast, changing waters of the Arabian Sea, Against the Tide explores the collision of tradition and technology, community and survival, through the intimate bond between two men as close as brothers. \nThe film was selected for the Sundance Film Festival 2023 \u2013 World Cinema Documentary Competition, where it received widespread acclaim for its lyrical storytelling and urgent relevance. \nThe screening will be followed by a conversation between the Director, Sarvnik Kaur and Sunanda Bhat, along with an audience Q&A. \nProduction Crew:Director & Producer \u2013 Sarvnik KaurProducer \u2013 Koval BhatiaCo-Producer \u2013 Quentin LaurentEditing \u2013 Atanas GeorgievEditing \u2013 Blagoja NedelkovskiSound Design \u2013 Moinak Bose \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "15 minutes | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 | India \nHuliyappa is a short documentary in Kannada by first-time filmmaker, Sourabha Rao. Shot entirely in the remote hamlets of the Uttara Kannada district, the film is centred around an ancient custom of worshipping the eponymous tiger deity during Deepavali, for the protection of people and their livestock from large Carnivora \u2013 tigers, leopards and bears. \nThe film reveals the losses faced by the residents of this thickly forested Western Ghats landscape to themselves and their prized cattle due to incidents with wildlife, and the surprising tolerance, forgiveness and compassion that prevail in people despite them. It is an exploration of the mythical, emotional and rational origins of the remarkable faith. Through conversations with people from various strata of the local society, including scholars, farmers and cowherds, Rao makes a concise and compelling retelling of a culture that has maintained the unlikeliest harmony between humans and wildlife in the region for centuries, and documents the simple rituals that constitute it. \nRather soberingly, Huliyappa is also a timely reminder of the dire need to impress such indigenous practices upon a generation increasingly disconnected from its roots, if the equilibrium with Nature, so pivotal to the future of humanity, is to be vouchsafed. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with the team that made the film, in conversation with Sonu Venugopal. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis screening is part of BIC\u2019s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience.\u00a0This year\u2019s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change, communities whose lives are entangled with the land, the waters, and the skies, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience.\u00a0Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n",

    "description": "If the century spanning 1850 to 1950 was that of Tyagaraja, the next one undoubtedly belongs to Muthuswami Dikshitar. He has been the subject of the same intense study that his illustrious contemporary was previously. The corpus of his songs in public circulation has gone up tremendously during this period, though debates continue on the genuineness of some of these. This is exactly the way Tyagaraja kritis went up in circulation and publications were churned out on them from the mid-19th century onwards. Dikshitar like a late-blooming flower is slowly unfurling petal after petal, revealing some, but not all the facets of his personality. There is something about him that seems to speak to the 21st century mind. \nThis lecture by Historian, V Sriram will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. \nPresented by:\n \n",

    "description": "Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India\u2019s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of \u2018direct benefits\u2019 which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session, Louise Tillin, the author of the book, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "What would justice look like if it spoke in a queer voice? How might legal judgments shift if they were written through the lived experiences and realities of LGBTQIA+ individuals? \nIn this session, we explore the bold and imaginative work of The Queer Judgments Project,\u00a0an initiative that seeks to re-think, re-write, and re-invent legal judgments through queer and complementary perspectives. Emerging from a series of conversations among scholars, activists, and legal thinkers, the project asks a vital question: how could legal decisions involving sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics be expressed differently, more inclusively, more justly? \nAt the heart of the discussion is the project\u2019s first major output: an edited collection that offers 26 re-imagined judgments and commentaries from across the globe. Through this collection, contributors bring their diverse disciplinary backgrounds and personal insights to bear on the law, queering traditional frameworks and imagining alternative approaches to legal reasoning. \nThis session will engage with the creative, critical, and deeply personal work that underpins these re-written judgments. It will reflect on how the project aims not just to critique existing legal structures but to open up new possibilities for justice that better reflect the experiences of LGBTQIA+ and other minoritized communities. \n",

    "description": "Abhang is a genre of\u00a0classical\u00a0music from Maharashtra, primarily sung in praise of\u00a0Sri\u00a0Vitthala of Pandharpur. The term Abhang means no ending or no interruption. Over 10,000 Abhangs were composed by various Sants of Maharashtra, including Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Eknath, Sant Tukaram, Sant Namdev, and Sant Janabhai. Emerging from the Bhakti Sampradaya in the 12th century, Abhangs have become integral to Concerts and Bhajans. Varkaris (devotees of Sri Vitthala) sing Abhangs while walking towards Pandharpur. Sri.\u00a0Purandaradasa adopted the name \u2018Purandara Vitthala\u2019 as his ankitanama, as \u2018Vitthala\u2019 was his Ishta Murti, while the name \u2018Purandara\u2019 was bestowed upon him by his guru, Sri Vyasa Raya. \nUma Kumar, Carnatic Singer from Switzerland, and\u00a0the ensemble\u00a0will perform 12 Abhangs composed by 10 composers, set in 12 different Hindustani ragas and presented in both on-beat and off-beat rhythms.\u00a0She\u00a0will render these Abhangs in the Carnatic style, accompanied by Violin and Mridangam,\u00a0while complementing the sound with\u00a0Tabla and\u00a0Manjira to fully express these divine compositions\u2019 deep emotions. \nAbhang Mela aims to create a musical symphony, blending the bhava from singing, the nada from the Violin, the laya from the Tabla and Mridangam, and the high-pitched rhythms from the Manjira, alongside the melodious sound of the Tanpura. Music lovers are invited to enjoy this unique musical experience. \nPresented by: \nUma Kumar \n",

    "description": "As the climate crisis deepens, it becomes ever more urgent to ask: Who bears the burden? Who holds the wisdom? \nThis year\u2019s Environment Day programming centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change, communities whose lives are entangled with the land, the waters, and the skies, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. \nRather than viewing the environment as separate from society, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. From fisherwomen on the coast to forest guardians, waste workers, farmers, and displaced families, the day invites us to witness, to engage, and to reimagine a just, inclusive response to ecological breakdown. \nThrough performances, conversations, and hands-on workshops, we explore not only what is vanishing, but what must be protected, restored, and re-rooted. \nSchedule: \nTasting Climate Change: Could Coffee as We Know It Vanish?\n11am \u2013 8pm | Exhibition | Black Baza Coffee\nLink to know more. \nThe Earth Remembers: Climate Change through Cartoons\n11am \u2013 8pm | Exhibition | Open Call\nLink to know more. \nLeafy Tales for Little Explorers: Discover the World of Leaves Through Stories, Play, and Wonder!\n11am \u2013 1pm | Kids\u2019 Workshop | Harini Nagendra & APU\nLink to know more. \nMy Otter Diary: Playful, Resilient Otters in India\u2019s Shifting Waterways\n11am \u2013 12:30pm | Screening & Conversation | Sugandhi Gadadhar, Rana Belur & Shivu\nLink to know more. \nWhat on Earth?!: An Offbeat Quiz to Ground You in Planet-Friendly Fun and Facts\n2pm \u2013 3:30pm | Quiz | Berty Ashley\nLink to know more. \nBreaking the Nets: An Oral History of India\u2019s Fisherwomen\n4pm \u2013 5:30pm | Screening & Conversation | Shamsheer Yousaf, Monica Jha, Sriram Vittalamurthy & Lakshmi Murthy\nLink to know more. \nEvery Grain a Story: Mapping Self & Culture Through Rice Appreciation: A Sensory Workshop on Heirloom Rice, Memory, & Food Culture\n4pm \u2013 5:30pm | Workshop | Edible Archives \nHuliyappa \u2013 A Retelling: Faith, Compassion and Conservation\n6pm \u2013 7pm | Screening & Conversation | Sourabha Rao, Santosh Saligram, Rakesh Kote, Anusha Hegde & Sonu Venugopal\nLink to know more. \nBound by Soil: A Requiem for the Forgotten: Progress Asks for Offerings; The Earth Has Long Borne the Altar\n8pm \u2013 9pm | Performance | Anuradha Venkataraman\nLink to know more. \n",

    "description": "What happens when a defiant chronicler and an idealist revolutionary converge in the\u00a0playground that is India\u2019s freedom struggle? Urdu newspaper Pratap, launched in pre-partition India, was a torchbearer against the British Raj. The man who publicly defended it\u00a0against colonial censorship was none other than Jawaharlal Nehru. \nThe pen picked up by freedom fighter Virendra, the paper\u2019s editor and the founder\u2019s son who once walked shoulder to shoulder with stalwarts like Bhagat Singh was equally fearless\u00a0despite threats by the imperial government, Indira Gandhi\u2019s Emergency and a parcel bomb\u00a0sent to Pratap\u2019s office during terrorism in Punjab. \nVirendra was first arrested in the historic Saunders murder case. He was also in jail with\u00a0Bhagat Singh the day the legendary revolutionary was hanged, sharing a rare first-hand\u00a0witness account. In Independent India, too footsteps filled Pratap and its editors with dread\u00a0and terror. \nPratap: A Defiant Newspaper is a timely reminder of the ethos of a struggle, a template for\u00a0speaking truth to power at all costs. It is the story of a perfect storm. The book is written by Virendra\u2019s son, distinguished editor Chander Mohan and journalist granddaughter Jyotsna Mohan. Jyotsna and Azeezullah Baig will be in conversation with Maya Sharma. There will be a Q&A session with the audience. \n",
