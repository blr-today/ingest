    "description": "What does the life of an ordinary working-class Indian look and feel like? \nJoin us for a panel discussion discussing this and more with the author of\u00a0The Many Lives of Syeda X Neha Dixit and commentator and editor Priya Ramani. \nIn her book The Many Lives of Syeda X\u00a0 journalist Neha Dixit traces the story of one such faceless Indian woman, Syeda X, from the early 1990s to the present day. What emerges is a picture of a life lived under constant corrosive tension. \nResearched for close to a decade, in this book, we meet an unforgettable cast of characters for whom\u00a0displacement, tragedy and hardships are the things they are used to. Written with empathy and deep insight, this book is a portal to a harsh world hidden away from elite Indians. It is the story of untold millions and a searing account of urban life in New India. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nPresented by:\n \n",

    "description": "What happens when we begin to realise that perhaps what we see isn\u2019t through clear eyes? \nWhat if we not just sense that many lenses exist in this world,\nBut also that each one of us has an endless supply of them. Lenses big and small\nLenses of all kinds\nDifferent lenses for different people\nDifferent lenses for different situations\nLenses Inspired by the learnings and un learnings of our individual and collective journeys. Lenses inspired by the biases and fears we wear as shields. \nAnd what happens when lenses begin to come off\nOne at a time? \nMeri Aenak Se is a journey a part of each one of us is on. A secret quest each human being is on, a quest of love, a quest for a world with that love\nSo one can surrender to it\nWe take these journeys while we travel on roads that are parallel to one another,\nas we live alongside each other\nBut we take these journeys in isolation.\n\nWhat would happen if suddenly, these journeys became aware of one another?\n\n\nAbout The Aahvaan Project \n\n\n\nThe journey of Aahvaan, a musical collective, has been nothing short of an odyssey. Beginning in late 2016, the past two years have been a watershed moment for the group, as they have traversed the length and breadth of the country, performing, conducting workshops, and enriching themselves through the experience. \nThroughout their tours, Aahvaan has continued to refine their musical style, fusing diverse genres and collaborating with like-minded artists to create a sound that they believe is a modern representation of Nirgun. This constant evolution has allowed them to connect with fellow travellers along the way, each encounter contributing to their artistic growth. \nAahvaan\u2019s latest presentation, \u201cMeri Aenak Se,\u201d is an exploration of the differences in perception, attitudes, and actions that shape our individual experiences. It invites the audience to step into the shoes of another, to see the world through their eyes, and to share in their joys and struggles as if they were one\u2019s own. \nThe original songs and stories, lovingly and thoughtfully curated by Vedi and Sumant, are a testament to Aahvaan\u2019s commitment to storytelling. They cherish the opportunity to share their journey with audiences, fostering a deeper understanding and connection between individuals and cultures. \nAahvaan\u2019s story is one of growth, exploration, and the power of music to bridge the gaps between us. Through their performances and workshops, they continue to inspire and captivate audiences, inviting them to embark on a journey of self-discovery and empathy. \n\u00a0 \nSupported by \n \n",

    "description": "This session\u00a0presents an enthralling journey through the rich history of the sitar, beginning with its origins and evolution across centuries. The performance explores the sitar\u2019s creation from natural elements, merging Persian and Indian musical traditions to symbolize its sacred and timeless nature. As the sitar travels through royal courts, it becomes a symbol of refinement and cultural prestige, before eventually establishing itself as a central instrument in Indian classical music. This concert highlights the transformation, showcasing the sitar\u2019s rise as a solo instrument and its deep connection to Indian music. \nHonoring the contributions of legendary sitarists like Ustad Vilayat Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar, this performance will illustrate their groundbreaking innovations that shaped the sitar\u2019s modern identity and global influence. From classical Indian ragas to cross-cultural experiments, the sitar\u2019s role in contemporary music will be explored, demonstrating its versatility and ongoing relevance in world music. Through a blend of storytelling and music, this performance celebrates the instrument\u2019s enduring legacy and its profound impact on both classical and global music. \nPresented by \n \n",

    "description": "Many years ago, in Detroit during a chance meeting with Jerry Murad of the Harmonicats, a commitment was made. Sulaiman Jamal met Jerry Murad at a harmonica convention, and he asked Sulaiman to continue playing the chromatic harmonica. He highlighted the versatility and beauty of the small instrument. That was Sulaiman\u2019s motivation and inspiration to continue playing the unique instrument which he had actually put in cold storage. \nWhile Jerry had passed away many years ago, Sulaiman was reminded by a mutual friend that he had not fulfilled Jerry\u2019s request \u2013 This concert is to do just that. \nThe theme of the concert is to cover some of the greatest Broadway and cinema themes, mainly from yesteryear which have warmed our hearts. \nThe evening will include favourites from Phantom of the Opera, The Wizard of Oz, Jesus Christ Superstar, Fiddler on the Roof and more. Not to forget the classics from The Beatles, Leonard Cohen, Simon and Garfunkel, and Big Band and Blues numbers. \nWith a group of extremely talented and accomplished musicians, the evening can\u2019t be anything but memorable.

Through an array of rare, vintage, and contemporary choreographies, the dancers weave together the past and the present, allowing historical veracity to coexist with artistic resilience. \nThis unique performance delves into Kathak\u2019s diverse journey across regions and eras, offering an insightful exploration of how artistic expression has both shaped and been shaped by the socio-political contexts of its time. From the courts of ancient kingdoms to the modern stage, the show showcases Kathak\u2019s timeless beauty and enduring adaptability, all while celebrating the dance\u2019s poetic spirit. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

Set against the backdrop of citizenship and partition, this story is akin to a sweet eye-opener, inviting us to ponder the true meaning of being a citizen. \nAt the heart of the play lies a family in an Indian coastal village during the tumultuous partition era. The wounds and displacements caused by the division of the nation have traveled far, reaching even this remote southern hamlet. Yet, the unique sense of humour and the strong family dynamics that define the village people become the lifeblood of the narrative. \nThe play challenges the notion that citizenship is merely about papers and borders. Instead, it explores the deeper, more complex question of what it means to feel truly at home \u2013 a sentiment that transcends the physical boundaries of a nation. \nThe play\u2019s rich tapestry of characters and their experiences weave a tapestry of resilience, adaptability, and the enduring power of community. As the audience follows the family\u2019s journey, they are confronted with the harsh realities of displacement and the fragility of identity, but also with the profound joy and comfort found in the embrace of a supportive, close-knit society. \nThrough its blend of humour, poignancy, and universal themes, \u2018Jategiruvanu Chandira\u2019 emerges as a powerful testament to the human spirit, reminding us that the true essence of citizenship lies not in documents, but in the sense of belonging and the connections that bind us together, transcending the artificial divisions of the world.

    "description": "Kannada with English Subtitles | 113 Minutes | 1993 \nAfter the death of the father, a family is forced to move from their home in the forest to the city, where they barely scrape by. \nThis month\u2019s film featured in our informal film club is Devara Kaadu\u00a0(1993) \n\u201cDevara Kaadu\u201d is a poignant Indian film that weaves together themes of environmental conservation, family bonds, and the struggle for survival. Directed by Pattabhirama Reddy, this 1993 drama tells the story of Deva, a young man whose life journey takes him from the forests of his childhood to the harsh realities of urban life, and back again to his roots. \nThe narrative begins with tragedy, as Deva and his mother are forced to leave their forest home after his father\u2019s death. In the city, they face the challenges of poverty head-on. While his mother works as a domestic helper, young Deva takes on the role of a rag-picker, scraping together what he can to support their meager existence. As he grows older, Deva advances to pulling a rickshaw, a symbol of his determination to improve their circumstances. \nHowever, the city\u2019s toll on his mother\u2019s health becomes evident. Her dying wish to return to their native place sets in motion a bittersweet journey. Though she doesn\u2019t survive to see their homeland, Deva ensures her final resting place is beside his father\u2019s grave. \nIt\u2019s at this pivotal moment that Deva\u2019s true life\u2019s work begins. Honouring his parents\u2019 wishes and memory, he embarks on a remarkable four-decade mission to reforest the barren land they once called home. Through his tireless efforts, Deva transforms the landscape, creating a lush forest where once there was only abandoned earth. \n\u201cDevara Kaadu\u201d is not just a tale of personal loss and perseverance; it\u2019s a powerful allegory for mankind\u2019s relationship with nature. The film showcases how one individual\u2019s dedication can lead to monumental change, breathing life back into forgotten lands and communities. \nRecognized for its environmental message, \u201cDevara Kaadu\u201d was awarded the National Film Award for Best Film on Environment Conservation/Preservation in 1993, cementing its place as a significant work in Indian cinema. \nCredits: \nDirector: Pattabhirama Reddy\nAssociate Director: Konark Reddy\nStory and Screenplay: Pattabhirama Reddy\nDialogue: Su Ramakantha, C Chandrashekar\nMusic: Konark Reddy\nCinematography: Navroze Contractor\nEditor: Suresh Urs\nArt Direction: G Murthy\nCostume Design: G Murthy\nMakeup: Sharavanan\nSound: V Aravindan, P K Suresh (Dialogues), K S Krishnamurthy (Re-Recording) \nStarring:\nKirthana Kumar, K T Abraham, Kantharaj, Prabhu, Anand, T S Nagabharana, Katte Ramachandra, Suman Ramesh, C Chandrashekar, A R Chandrashekar, Usha Bhandari, Dakshinachar, Abbas Abbalagere, Kantesh, C V Rudrappa, Uma Rudrappa, Indu, Raja Balakrishna, Joseph Katukaran, Chandra, Mutthuraj \nProduced by: Pattabhirama Reddy Productions\nPresented by: The Concerned for Working Children (Bangalore)\nProduction Manager: Kotappa \n\nAbout B\u2022Cinematic \n\nCalling all cinephiles!

    "description": "Ardha \u2013 The Incomplete Dream is a solo work born out of a collection of essays contained in the book, Finding Radha by Namita Gokhale and Malashri Lal. Weaving together Bharatanatyam and spoken word, Ardha looks at Radha as the \u2018adhara\u2019 in whom the essence of Krishna is held. Beyond her oft-recognized status as Krishna\u2019s lover and his chosen gopi, Radha is \u2018Hladini Shakti\u2019 \u2013 the potency that is half of Krishna, their spirits engaged in perpetual \u2018Lila Hava\u2019- the exchange of ornaments, attire, and souls. \nCould Radha be an illusion that, through her dhara (flow) of joy and pain in union and separation, symbolizes the yearning for something beyond, a yearning that exists in every human? What happened to Radha after Krishna left Mathura? Why is Krishna celebrated while Radha, is a mere shadow in her aradhana to him? \nCredits:  \n\u2013 Concept, Choreography, Dance, Spoken word: Vidhya Subramanian \n\u2013 Music Composition: Shreya Devnath \n\u2013 Sound track produced at Resound India and mixed and mastered by Sai Shravanam \n\u2013 Musicians: Keerthana Vaidyanathan, Shreya Devnath, Sivaprasad, Sruti Sagar, Sai Shravanam, Manonmani, Vidhya Subramanian \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "India, being one of the developing countries in the world, does face many challenges when it comes to taking up specific developmental projects for the benefit of the people. Natural resources management and societal applications are the biggest areas for India where the Government spends lots of funds for the benefit of its people. \nGovernment spendings of public money in many important areas, such as, building rural and urban infrastructure, programs on land & water conservation, agriculture, water, forests, energy and many others to ensure sustainable development of all basic needs of the people, are efforts towards achieving our sustainable developmental goals. This calls for meticulous planning and well-orchestrated implementation and monitoring. \nSpace technology provides many interesting solutions in terms of Earth observation, communication and GNSS based solutions. The presentation brings out specific areas where such solutions are being provided to the Government using space technology so that the goals of development and governance are met amicably. \nThe talk by Prof. Diwakar will be followed by a discussion with Ecologist, Harini Nagendra. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nThis session is part of the Let\u2019s Talk Climate Change Talk series. \nPresented by: \n \n",
