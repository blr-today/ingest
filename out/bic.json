From her early work as a human rights advocate to her years as a Member of the National Commission for Women and the Planning Commission of India, she has been a campaigner for gender equity, communal harmony, and social justice. Her journeys have taken her from villages across India to the Wagah border, where she lit candles for peace between India and Pakistan, year after year. \nBorn into a family steeped in cultural and intellectual legacy, her father was the noted educationist Khwaja Ghulamus Saiyidain and her uncle the legendary writer and filmmaker Khwaja Ahmed Abbas, Syeda Hameed\u2019s life has been shaped by both privilege and purpose. She has translated and edited the works of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, as well as literary greats like Ghalib, Faiz, Hali, and Sarmad Shaheed, bringing their voices into contemporary discourse with clarity and grace. \nIn her latest book, A Drop in The Ocean : The Story of My Life,\u00a0Syeda offers a personal narrative, tracing her journey through moments of joy, struggle, and transformation. Beginning with the story she published at the age of nine, sparked by a moment of childhood exclusion for bearing a Muslim name, it is a memoir that speaks to identity, resilience, and the lifelong pursuit of peace. \nThe session will begin with a talk by Syeda Hameed, followed by a conversation with Co-founder & Editor-in-Chief, The News Minute,\u00a0Dhanya Rajendran.\u00a0A Q&A with the audience will follow.

    "description": "Older than the Himalayas, the Deccan is the oldest geological formation of the Indian subcontinent. Endemic species, some found nowhere else on earth, once inhabited this landscape, teeming with wildlife. Gently undulating plains of endless grasslands and savannah, rocky thorn and scrub jungles, and riverine and riparian ecosystems, were rich with an amazing biodiversity of flora and fauna. Tigers roamed and Asiatic Cheetah hunted Black Buck in high-speed chases across the plains. From Dung Beetles to Sloth Bears, from the Great Indian Bustard to Caracals, from millions of migratory birds arriving in winter, to wild flora rich with life-giving sustenance, this was the Deccan. From the unbearable heat of summer, to the welcome monsoons, the land was vibrant. From cool winters to a short spring, culture and nature tell stories of millions of years of evolution.\u00a0 \nFast forward to today, and the reality of the effects of unsustainable development. Loss of habitat, rampant illegal wildlife trade, roadkill, conflict with the grassroots level stakeholders, have all taken a heavy toll. We have lost most of our pristine wilderness and over half of our flora and fauna. \nThis presentation will take the audience through a view of the past, present and future of the Deccan landscape. It will include the work of the Deccan Conservation Foundation as para ecologists, preserving, protecting and conserving the last remaining isolated, unprotected habitats and wilderness, with a focus on the Indian Wolf, the apex predator, and other associated species. \nImage Credit: All photos by Indrajeet Ghorpade. \nPresented by the Deccan Conservation Foundation. \n \n",

    "description": "This conversation between writer and journalist Tsering Namgyal Khortsa and educator Ngawang Gyatso will explore themes of exile, identity, memory, and belonging within the Tibetan diaspora. Focusing on the lived experience of Tibetans beyond the spiritual lens often associated with their narrative, the session will examine how literature becomes a space for cultural preservation, political reflection, and personal inquiry. \nTsering Namgyal Khortsa is the author of Little Lhasa: Reflections on Exiled Tibet, a collection of essays and interviews that chronicle the diverse voices and realities of the Tibetan exile community. From political activism and Buddhist practice to filmmaking and English-language literature, the book presents a vivid portrait of life in Dharamsala, seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, and the evolving identity of a people navigating displacement. \nHis novel Tibetan Suitcase follows Dawa Tashi, an India-born Tibetan, as he journeys across continents and inner worlds, exploring questions of love, cultural inheritance, and spiritual searching. Told through letters and journal entries, the novel captures the poignancy of existing between worlds, without a homeland, but anchored by memory and longing. \nTogether, the conversation offers a window into Tibetan life as it is lived today\u2014in exile, in continuity, and in search of home. A Q&A with the audience ll follow. \n",
