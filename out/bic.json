    "description": "\u201cShruthi Maatha, Laya Pitah\u201d is a famous saying where Shruthi and Layam are seen as two most important fundamentals of music. Layam is a basic rhythm that flows through any movement, expressed as Thaalam (beats). There is an implicit Layam and explicit Layam. The former is something that has to be realised for the latter to be grounded into one\u2019s sensibilities and mind. \nMany music composers have explored this layam aspect of music, but the Trinity (Thyagarajaswamy , Muthuswamy Deekshitar and Shyama Saastrigal) stand out in this. Just like in Raagam, in Layam also they have many firsts. The basic framework of tala dasha pranas have also been used by them intelligently in their kritis. \nThis presentation will look at that basic framework of layam and how trinity made it shine even better, both intuitive and explicit. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Join us for an evening of Dhrupad, reimagined by two young and talented Dhrupadiyas. \nMurali Mohan Gowda will introduce the basic concepts and techniques of Dhrupad, specifically related to Dagarbani and Raga music in general. He will cover topics including the basic differences between Dhrupad and other forms of Indian classical music, the origin of Dhrupad, the concept of Ragas, structure and improvisational tools, and Talas and compositions. \nIn the second part of the concert, Shilpa Shankar Narrain will explore unique aspects of Muthuswami Dikshitar\u2019s compositions from a Dhrupad perspective. Considered one of the holy trinity of Carnatic music, Dikshitar traveled far and wide, and it is believed he lived in Varanasi for eight years. During this time, he was greatly influenced by Dhrupad and is known to have composed various kritis with Dhrupad and Hindustani elements. \nCome and be part of a musical journey that bridges the past and the present, honoring the legacy of Dhrupad while exploring its future possibilities. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "The design of the IIM Bangalore (IIMB) campus has evolved through contributions from multiple architects over time, yet its adaptable built and open spaces seem to have allowed it to develop into a cohesive and integrated entity. The book The Making of a Campus: IIM Bangalore shares how this campus came into being and how it has been experienced over time. Through its pages, the book reveals the thought processes, design philosophies, and the interplay between architecture and community that have contributed to the campus\u2019s continuing appeal and functionality. \nUsing the book as a starting point, the session will explore how a shared design philosophy has imbued the campus with a sense of timelessness. This project, conceived and executed by architects Balkrishna Doshi and Achyut Kanvinde with subsequent additions by Sanjay Mohe & Medappa, stands as a testament to the enduring design. \nThe session will commence with an introduction by the book\u2019s author, Kiran Keswani, followed by insights from Bijoy Ramachandran, who has produced two documentary films on Doshi. Subsequently, architects Sanjay Mohe and Medappa will present their contributions to the campus design, sharing their discoveries, challenges, and outcomes. The event will conclude with a dialogue on \u2018creative collaboration\u2019 among the speakers and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Entertaining the nobility of India, her life was different from the other women around her. She had financial independence, she could choose her patrons and partners, and most importantly, she was highly skilled at her art, her music! \nTawaifs and women performers were given a reputation, one that made their life difficult and tainted them as prostitutes and sex workers. Unfortunately, history doesn\u2019t credit them enough for their most valuable contribution to Indian Culture, their Music! Even though they were known for Thumri, Dadra, other semiclassical forms like hori, jhoola, chaiti and so on, they were the first performers to set ghazals to tune and bring them to the performance space as a music genre. This performance will be tracing the evolution of this beautiful genre that gained popularity through the performance of Tawaifs and many other women performers over the years. \nO Gaanewali invites you on a journey through the rich cultural heritage of Indian music, sharing fascinating stories and anecdotes as it introduces iconic forms like thumri, dadra, hori, chaiti, and ghazal, made famous by the legendary Tawaifs and the many talented women who followed in their footsteps \nCreated for lovers for Ghazal, this format explores a slightly later time period in the lives of these artists, taking the audience through a nostalgic musical journey. Expect to hear some evergreen Ghazals like Aye Muhobbat Tere Anjaam Pe Rona Aya, Hum Dekhenge, Woh Jo Hum Mein Tum Mein Qarar Tha, Mere Humnafas and more! \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Recognising the potential of the handloom sector to provide sustainable employment and meet the growing demand for handloom fabric, the Government of Karnataka introduced \u2018Mahatma Gandhi Vastrodyama\u2019, a liaison between weaver co-operatives, producers, and the market, in last year\u2019s budget. However, this project has not progressed beyond a few meetings and the initial proposal stage. Meanwhile, the past year has seen the condition of handloom weavers decline further, reaching a state of emergency. Without proper access to markets and design interventions, they are unable to realise the true value of their traditional skills. \nAs we face increasing natural disasters, periods of flood and drought, and the looming climate catastrophe, ecologically sustainable rural industries such as handlooms and khadi can provide sustainable employment opportunities without harming nature. On Handloom Day, we hope to rekindle this discussion and draw attention to this critical issue. \nPresented by: \n \n",

This lush and spiritual collaboration bridges traditions and defies genres, blending South Indian classical music, Western chamber music, and jazz improvisation.

    "description": "Demonised as he was after his death, the reign of King Ravana of Lanka, and his ancestors, the powerful Mayuranga, has long been obscured and shrouded in myth. Their kingdom is believed to have reached beyond the shores of the island, once, capturing lands across the seas. A kingdom of such magnitude was never seen again on Lanka. \nIn a bid to shed light on this lost era, Sunela Jayewardene travelled through Sri Lanka, and listened to the storytellers and poets, researched Sri Lanka\u2019s folklore, sifted through race and religion, to stitch together a history of a forgotten landscape. \nThe story of the kingdom that\u00a0Ravana\u00a0had ruled lay over the island like a fading, antique map. The edges of the story were frayed and there were lines disconnected by time, but the landscape it traced, exists. Ravana\u2019s Lanka: The Landscape of a Lost Kingdom, written by Sunela Jayewardene is the story she learnt of King Ravana and the kingdom that he lost. \nIn this session, Sunela will be in conversation with Theatre Practitioner, Anuradha Venkataraman. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",
