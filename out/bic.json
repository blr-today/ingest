    "description": "\nThe session builds on Asko Parpola & Iravatham Mahadevan\u2019s extensive works to show that a substantial portion of the IVC seals was a Celestial Omens List with the planet Venus occupying a central role in their astronomy. The study presents the full decipherment of 75 inscriptions and a partial decipherment of 61 inscriptions forming approximately 5% of the total number of inscriptions. \n\n\n\nKey findings demonstrate the exceptional astronomical sophistication of the Harappan civilization, including: (1) proof that bilingual parallels can effectively decipher the IVC script; (2) evidence that Harappan astronomical knowledge predated Babylonian astronomy by centuries; (3) the first complete decipherment of the Swastika symbol, revealing its astronomical significance; (4) identification of signs for planetary movements, conjunctions, and their associated omens; (5) discovery of Harappan meteorological methods using Venusian astronomy; and (6) a new understanding of the Great Bath Complex as a venue for astronomical rituals. \n\n\nThis work represents a significant breakthrough in understanding the intellectual and religious life of one of the world\u2019s earliest urban civilizations, revealing their deep engagement with astronomical observation and its application to social and religious practices. Through archaeoastronomical analysis, the paper reconstructs the probable actual dates of celestial events tracked by the Harappans, providing empirical validation for the proposed decipherments.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience.\n\n",

    "description": "Equus derived from the Latin word for \u2018Horse\u2019 is a psychological drama that delves deep into the mind\u2019s primal corners. Written in 1973, the English \u201cwhydunit\u201d, inspired by a real-life incident, unravels the mystery behind a shocking act of violence; \u201cSeventeen-year-old, Alan Strang, blinds four horses with a metal spike, in a single night\u201d. \nThe story follows Martin Dysart, a child psychiatrist, who begins treating Alan, only to find himself grappling with his inner turmoil. As the investigation unfolds, Dysart brings to light, Alan\u2019s religious, emotional, and sexual obsession for horses, which leads him to confront unsettling truths about the nature of normalcy, worship, and desire. Consumed by envy of Alan\u2019s raw, unfiltered passion, he is forced to confront the suffocating monotony of his own life. \nPlayhouse re-imagines the classic through Jung\u2019s lens of \u2018Shadow Self\u2019, and makes use of the evocative power of shadow theatre to throw light on the darkness that remains hidden. Alan\u2019s intense passion and obsession with horses becomes a powerful metaphor for humanity\u2019s most profound extremes\u2014what we suppress, what we idolize, and what ultimately defines our very existence. \nCrafted by Peter Shaffer \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Bag Dancing, written by Mike Kenny, one of England\u2019s foremost playwrights for young audiences, is directed by Ujwala Rao and produced by Butai. The cast features acclaimed Kannada and English theatre artists B V Shrunga and Surabhi J Herur. \nThe play poignantly follows Imelda, a homeless woman who carries her life\u2019s memories and stories in bags. Neville, a young worker at a homeless shelter, guards his emotions, burdened by his own past. As their unexpected friendship blossoms, they begin to share their stories, creating a meaningful bond between them. \nDirector\u2019s Note: \nBag Dancing is a play that has drawn me in repeatedly. What continues to captivate me is how playwright Mike Kenny thoughtfully and playfully explores powerful themes such as war, displacement, and the intersection of mental health and authority\u2014particularly through a lens that resonates with children and young audiences. \nDuring the creative process, I\u2019ve found the exploration of boxes and borders especially intriguing\u2014who defines them, who decides their importance, and how we navigate the spaces they limit. \nThis play presents a unique opportunity for families and schools to engage in meaningful conversations with children, sparking discussions about complex topics that might otherwise seem too difficult or uncomfortable to address. \nI hope Bag Dancing fosters reflection, curiosity, and open dialogue. \nCredits: \nProduction Assistant: Rachana R\nChoreography: Asha Basavaraj \nSupported by: \n \n",

Devaki\u2019s poignant voice follows, reflecting on the joys of motherhood she never fully experienced and her yearning to reclaim lost moments with her son, Krishna. The production concludes with Akka Mahadevi, whose powerful Vachanas guide us on a quest for liberation, echoing the eternal human desire for union and truth. \nEach piece is supported by evocative compositions, guided by literary scholars, and brought to life through thoughtful choreography. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "The object of this lecture is to analyze the world order that was put in place at the end of World War II, examine how it has unfolded in terms of experience since then, and highlight some important manifestations of its multiple crises, to discuss possible future scenarios for 2050. In doing so, it asks four questions and seeks to provide answers. \nAre we witnessing the beginnings of a transformative change in the world order? Are we at the cusp of an emerging bi-polar world order, with the United States and China as the two superpowers? Are we moving towards a multi-polar world, in which there will be another 8-10 countries that are also key players? Are we going to live with a fluid situation and a\u00a0de facto\u00a0continuation of\u00a0Pax Americana? \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Deepak Nayyar will deliver a talk .This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in March 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Overcast, Audible, and Amazon Music. \n",
