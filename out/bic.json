    "description": "Oftentimes, the most powerful revolutions begin in verse. \nWith stirring narratives and emotional melodies, Mukti \u2013 Liberation in Song invites audiences to embark on an introspective journey, guided by the verses of poets who dared to dream beyond boundaries. The programme juxtaposes live performances of classical and folk compositions in multiple languages with immersive narration. Enhanced by a simulcast slideshow that spotlights the rich tapestry of Indian poetry, this event explores the perennial quest for freedom. \nFrom Tyagaraja\u2019s desire to break free from worldly attachments to Akka Mahadevi\u2019s defiance of patriarchal norms, each performance encapsulates a unique facet of liberation. Basavanna and Chokkamela\u2019s verses resonate with resistance against caste barriers, advocating universal equality. Kabir\u2019s timeless words soar with a similar spirit, calling upon souls to shatter dogmatic chains. \nThis evening, we honor the enduring spirit of Mukti and celebrate the poets whose voices envisioned a world where freedom isn\u2019t just a political concept, but a universally human truth. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Through exercises, group discussions and feedback, the workshop will impart practical knowledge on styles and strategies participants can choose from to suit both their personalities as well as the needs of a particular discussion. Finally, it will also provide tips to build confidence and cope with the last minute butterflies-in-the-stomach that is the worry of anyone who has ever \u2013 or never \u2013 walked onto a stage! \nIf you are keen on building a safe and inclusive space, and respectful and inspiring conversations, if you have an opinion but are interested in engaging with others\u2019, if you are \u2013 or want to be \u2013 moderate in truth, temperate in style and obdurate in quest, then this workshop is for you. \n",

    "description": "When rhythm takes flight and grace stands still, something timeless begins to move. \nOn our next evening of Dual Margam, two powerful classical traditions come together in a rare conversation of contrast and convergence. The soaring, drum-led dynamism of Pung Cholom from Manipur, and the grounded, sculptural flow of Odissi from Odisha. \nTraditionally, in Pung Cholom, dancers become percussionists: leaping, spinning, and drumming in mid-air with ecstatic energy and astonishing control. In contrast, Odissi unfolds in slow, sinuous arcs, where each gesture and every glance evokes poetry, myth, and devotion. \nIn this special performance, the two rhythmic traditions of Pung Cholom and Odissi are interwoven and contrasted: bringing fire to form, and pulse to poetry as the dances come together with complementary aesthetics. \nThe first in a two-part Odissi-Manipuri conversation, this evening unfolds through two male bodies and will be revisited next month through the feminine form. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "What does it take to keep a centuries-old craft alive in the 21st century? \nJoin us for a compelling panel discussion on the journey of Indian handlooms, where they\u2019ve come from, where they stand today, and what the road ahead might look like. Titled Handlooms\u2014Past, Present and Future, this conversation brings together iconic voices who have shaped, preserved, and championed India\u2019s rich textile heritage. \nFrom policy and preservation to design and storytelling, the panel will explore the layered realities behind India\u2019s handwoven traditions, especially in a time when fast fashion dominates and artisan livelihoods face uncertainty. \nThe discussion features Laila Tyabji, founder of Dastkar and pioneering craft revivalist; Ratna Krishna Kumar, patron of traditional arts and crafts; Nandita Das, actor, director and social advocate with a deep interest in handloom; and Chandra Jain, textile revivalist and presenter of River Weaves : Brocades of Banaras. The session will be moderated by award-winning writer and cultural commentator Shoba Narayan. \nExpect reflection, insight, and real questions: What must change? What must endure? And how can each of us \u2013 designers, buyers, storytellers, citizens, help ensure that India\u2019s handloom story continues to be written? \nThis panel discussion is part of the\u00a0River Weaves: Brocades of Banaras\u00a0exhibition, an immersive experience & exhibition that invites visitors into the world of Banarasi handloom, one of India\u2019s most exquisite and storied textile traditions. Presented by Chandra Jain and designed by Siddhartha Das Studio, the exhibition is a tribute to the artistry, symbolism, and sustainability embedded in every thread of Banaras brocade. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "130 minutes | Malayalam with English subtitles | 1978 | G Aravindan \nA circus tent rises by the river, and with it a world both real and imagined. \nThampu (The Circus Tent) is a luminous blend of documentary and fiction, capturing the arrival of a travelling circus to a quiet village on the banks of Kerala\u2019s Bharatapuzha river. Featuring real circus performers, local villagers, and a cast of non-actors, the film becomes a portrait of the everyday lives that unfold around a spectacle. \nDirected by G. Aravindan and shot by Shaji N. Karun, Thampu marked the second collaboration between two of Indian cinema\u2019s most visionary artists. Filmed in stark black and white on a modest budget, it is a masterclass in restraint and imagination. Every frame holds the weight of directorial decisions: what is showcased, and what is obscured. \nRecently restored by the Film Heritage Foundation and digitised by the National Film Archive of India, Thampu has been rediscovered by global audiences. From the Cannes Classics to the British Film Institute\u2019s Treasures segment, and most recently at the Festival of 3 Continents in Nantes, its revival is a tribute to Aravindan\u2019s enduring cinematic voice. \nFilmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini will introduce the film and moderate a post-screening Q&A. \nNote:\u00a0This special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G. Aravindan and cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun \u2013 both of whom we remember with great reverence.\u00a0BIC aims to pay homage to the iconic duo, and the Parallel Cinema movement they pioneered, through the screening of two films bound by their unique, shared cinematic vision.

    "description": "53 minutes | Urdu with English subtitles | 2020 | India \nSafia, a deeply religious Muslim woman from Bhopal in Central India, is driven by her belief that the patriarchal interpretation of Sharia denies Muslim women equality and justice within the community. Determined to challenge this, she joins a groundbreaking program that trains women as Qazis, Muslim clerics who interpret and administer personal law, a role traditionally reserved for men. \nHoly Rights documents Safia\u2019s courageous journey as she navigates uncharted territory, confronting resistance and reshaping narratives that profoundly impact women\u2019s lives. Through her story, and those of several other women who join the program, the film explores the gendered dimensions of faith and critiques the arbitrary and often unjust practice of instant triple talaq (divorce by pronouncing talaq three times). \nSpanning four years, the film also traces the wider movement against triple talaq and highlights Muslim women\u2019s efforts to assert their rights within their faith, while resisting both patriarchal forces within the community and political forces outside seeking to appropriate their struggle. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with filmmaker Farha and producer Priyanka More, and a Q&A with the audience. \nHere is the trailer of the film. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

The bus never comes. \nPiravi (The Birth)\u00a0is a quiet, devastating meditation on loss, hope, and the personal toll of political violence. Based on the life of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier, Piravi is an intimate elegy for a missing son and a father\u2019s unyielding prayer. With unforgettable performances from Lakshmi Krishnamoorthy and Archana, the film has earned nearly 30 international awards, standing as a poignant reminder of how political tragedies are always deeply, painfully personal. \nInspired by the real-life story of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier, whose son disappeared during India\u2019s Emergency in 1976 while studying at the Regional Engineering College in Calicut, Piravi captures the slow unraveling of a family consumed by grief. It is a heartrending portrayal of personal loss and the impact of political oppression. \nKarun\u2019s directorial debut film will be introduced by filmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini, who will also moderate the post-screening Q&A. \nNote:\u00a0This special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G.

    "description": "Storytelling is as old as mankind itself. In recent years there has been a resurgence in Storytelling, applying the narrative process in a wide range of settings, drawing from a variety of origins: in therapy, in community development, in toastmasters clubs, in management, in personal growth labs and so on. It may well become something of a bandwagon soon. \nBangalore Little Theatre (BLT) has developed a unique genre of storytelling theatre, presenting fully rehearsed performances, but in storytelling format. It is called the Courtyard programme. The main features of the programme are:\n\u2013\u00a0Performances in a variety of spaces, not necessarily a stage\n\u2013\u00a0Usually smaller numbers, in intimate surroundings\n\u2013\u00a0Typically two actors \u2013 even one as sometimes done\n\u2013\u00a0No staging requirements of sets, costumes, lights, etc. Just good performance! \nWhat will not be easily seen about Storytelling Theatre is that it requires a specialized approach to content and scripting and, therefore, a specialized technique in performance. Those who have seen BLT performances such as Robi\u2019s Garden and Shakespeare By Any Other Name will understand this readily. \nStorytelling Theatre in India is a relatively new form that is still evolving. Participants in the workshop will be contributing to its development. \nWho is this workshop for? \nThis workshop is meant for those who are already well into the theatre arts and are committed to future work in either theatre making or performance, but with a special interest in Storytelling Theatre. It is not meant for mere \u201corientation\u201d or armchair exploration.\u00a0It will be a doing workshop, covering such objectives as:\n\u2013 To examine and appreciate different forms of Storytelling\n\u2013 To look at the special needs of storytelling theatre\n\u2013 To explore the unique skill sets needed in the actor for the above \u2013 in body, voice and mind\n\u2013 To make a beginning in creating a community of theatre storytellers, committed to developing the form.\n\u2013 The last objective is significant. It is accepted that there can be a limited amount of coverage in a two-day workshop. We hope to continue as a community of storytelling theatre makers. \nPlease note:\u00a0The workshop will be for a limited number of participants. All interested in the workshop are requested to register early. BIC reserves the right to finalize the list of participants.\u00a0There will be no walk-in registrations at the workshop.\u00a0 \n",

Presented by Chandra Jain and designed by Siddhartha Das Studio, the exhibition is a tribute to the artistry, symbolism, and sustainability embedded in every thread of Banaras brocade. \nFrom shimmering motifs inspired by Mughal gardens and temple carvings, to rare handwoven sarees dyed using natural dyes after a gap of 125 years, River Weaves presents a textured narrative of tradition and revival. It highlights the unseen processes behind each masterpiece, degumming, spinning, dyeing, and weaving, while also centring the voices of the weavers, many of whom have inherited and protected this craft for generations. \nBut this tradition is withering. Fewer artisans are able to sustain the work, and the next generation is stepping away. Through this exhibition, we hope to rekindle awareness and inspire a return to wearing and supporting these textiles, because unless people continue to buy, the craft will not survive. \nRiver Weaves is more than a showcase, it\u2019s a call to action. Every Banarasi brocade is not just fabric, but a living story of skill, memory, and community. \nThe concept and vision for the exhibition were conceived by Chandra Jain, a long-time advocate of India\u2019s crafts and textiles.\u00a0The exhibition has been curated by Chiara Nath and Siddhartha Das of Siddhartha Das Studio, an award-winning, multi-disciplinary practice known for its powerful storytelling of India\u2019s cultural heritage. The studio specializes in museums, interpretation centres, exhibitions, and craft installations. Their design brings together historical depth and contemporary relevance, inviting visitors to engage meaningfully with the legacy of Banaras Brocade. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Insider accounts from political aides, bureaucrats, and diplomats have long illuminated the workings of power\u2014but even more enigmatic were the lobbyists. Operating in the shadows, often invisible to public scrutiny, they were intimately privy to clandestine negotiations, back-channel discussions, and subtle bureaucratic skirmishes. In his new roman-\u00e0-clef For No Reason At All, Ramjee Chandran shines a light on this hidden world. \nChandran\u2014well\u2011known in Bangalore as a journalist, publisher, and podcaster\u2014has, until now, remained silent about his time as a lobbyist in 1980s New Delhi, a pivotal era just before major economic reforms took hold. \nDrawing from real events, the novel charts the journey of a young lobbyist caught in a high-stakes conflict over silicon metal\u2014a material deemed strategically vital. Central to the drama is Metkem Silicon, which, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, devoted 17 years to developing indigenous silicon metal technology. Yet their efforts collided with a rival scheme spearheaded by the Department of Electronics, which wanted to bypass local innovation and import U.S. technology. \nWhat ensued was a four\u2011year bureaucratic war: media leaks, secret memorandums, and the covert involvement of the Soviets and other intelligence agencies\u2014culminating in a final decision placed in the hands of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. \nSet against the backdrop of Cold War Delhi on the cusp of liberalisation, the novel paints a vivid portrait of a nation\u2014and capital\u2014torn between ideologies and ambitions. The Soviet Union may have vanished, lobbyists have receded from public corridors, and few can claim first\u2011hand knowledge of that era. \nIn Confessions of a Lobbyist, Siddharth Raja\u2014a lawyer, historian, and bibliophile\u2014sits down with Ramjee Chandran to peel back the layers of this story, offering an insider\u2019s glimpse into a world that feels at once distant and disarmingly relevant. \n",

    "description": "It\u2019s here. The climate crisis is no longer a distant warning.\u00a0 \nClimate Change: The Policy, Law, and Practice is a vital intervention. A book that gathers decades of global negotiations, Indian legal battles, and emerging climate jurisprudence into one urgent and accessible narrative. From courtroom precedents to cutting-edge policy, from carbon markets to constitutional rights, it examines how law can both shape and respond to the climate emergency. \nAuthor and legal expert Jay Cheema draws from his experience as Amicus Curiae to the Supreme Court of India in a landmark carbon emissions case. Guiding us through the evolving legal architecture of climate action and accountability, his presentation will be followed by an incisive conversation with an interlocutor to explore the tensions and hopes within the climate discourse. An open Q&A will close the session. \nReshaping landscapes, displacing lives, and challenging our very systems of governance, this crisis can no longer be sidelined. Forests burn where there was once monsoon green, rivers swell as glaciers retreat, and the ancient cycle of India\u2019s six ritus feels increasingly unfamiliar. The chaos predicted by climate scientists in the 50\u2019s is increasingly creeping into our reality.\u00a0 \nBecause the climate crisis is not only legal and political, but deeply personal. \n",

    "description": "A poet\u2019s prerogative is to witness life. \nSiddhartha Menon\u2019s poetry belongs to a modern practice, going back to around 1900, of creating poems through spells of intense attention to non-human life for its own sake. This evening will begin with a conversation between Menon and Prashant Keshavmurthy on how two of Menon\u2019s six poem collections \u2013 The Compass Bird (2023) and Lone Pine (2025) \u2013 relate to this modern poetic practice. Together, they\u2019ll trace the lineage of a quiet but radical poetic tradition that resists metaphor, transcends language, and pulls attention. \nWhile the natural world has always been a favourite muse of the human mind, select poets have found powerful anecdotes to draw their readers in. Pushing past the self-centred gaze so familiar to us, the lyrical observations of this style asks us to witness the fascinating creatures with whom we share this world.\u00a0 \nClosing with a Q&A open to the audience, this event promises insights, inspiration, and immersion. \n",

Presented by Sri Vinayaka Yuvakara Kala Balaga and led by K.B. Swamy, this 60-minute interactive program unfolds as an immersive journey through the traditions, symbols, and sounds of this living heritage. \nGuided by a Sutradar, the experience begins with an introduction to Pooja Kunita\u2019s history and cultural significance, before artists perform a small pooja to the Goddess and demonstrate the intricate decoration of the sacred prayer frame. The ceremonial invocation follows, revealing the chants, gestures, and symbolic rituals that open every performance.\u00a0Audiences will explore the distinctive soundscape of traditional instruments like the Tamte, Nagarai, and Tarsi, and be invited to learn foundational dance steps (Hejjes) alongside the artists. The program builds with a demonstration of the acrobatic grace at the heart of Pooja Kunita, offering insight into how athletic skill and spiritual intent intertwine. The evening culminates in a full, high-energy performance that weaves together frame decoration, invocation, music, hejjes, and acrobatics\u2014offering a complete, living portrait of this devotional art form. \nThis is the fourth performance of our series\u00a0BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka\u2019s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression.\u00a0Through demonstrations, performances, and academic discussions, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "At the edge of legend and longing, two women wait for the same god. \nKalatra is a dance-theatre work by Keelaka Dance Company that reimagines the story of Murugan and his two consorts (Valli and Devanai) not as divine footnotes, but as women bound by love, rivalry, and fate. In the classical Hindu tradition, Murugan\u2019s union with both is a symbol of completeness, of sacred balance. But in Sri Lanka\u2019s local poetic lore, a quieter, more human story unfolds. \nThe journey begins in Kataragama, where Murugan is worshipped not just by Hindus, but by Buddhists, Muslims, and indigenous tribes. Each finds a reflection of their own devotion in his form. Here, the story of Valli takes root, even as the shrine of Devanai turns away. Locals say she cannot bear to see her lord walk each night to Valli\u2019s side. \nBlending Bharatanatyam and contemporary dance, Kalatra draws from mythology, regional poetry, and imagined memory. Presented by the Keelaka Dance Company, conceived by Jyotsna Shourie and Aneesha Grover, with music by Daniel B George, OS Arun, and Madstarbase. \nA performance where myth breathes, and devotion speaks! \nIn Collaboration with: \n \n\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n \n",

The second graphic novel deals with activism and takes us to Brazil, Lebanon and Benin to meet those fighting oppression and trying to make a societal change. \nFabien has been in residency in Bangalore for the last few weeks working on his next chapter which will deal with \u201clove and the couple\u201d. He has met with locals trying to understand how modern India approaches love relationships in all its forms. \nHe will talk about his work, how he operates and weaves together his interviews and research into a creative whole making it a stimulating graphic novel. Fabien will also share what he has experienced in Bangalore and will be keen to exchange with the audience about the theme subject of his current research (Love and the couple).
