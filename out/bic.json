    "description": "A jugalbandi for the new age! \nThis Hindustani concert brings together three musicians whose journeys converge at the frontier that is Indo-jazz. Saxophonist Phill Scarff, long associated with cross-cultural explorations, meets Bengaluru-based slide guitarist Dr. Prakash Sontakke, whose fluid phrasing draws from Hindustani grammar while remaining open to contemporary sound worlds. Tabla maestro Gurumurthy Vaidya completes the trio, grounding the dialogue with rhythmic depth and supple responsiveness. \nWhat unfolds is a conversation through improvisation. The saxophone\u2019s burnished tone, the gliding resonance of the slide guitar, and the intricate play of taal move between structure and freedom, tradition and risk. Rooted in classical sensibility yet shaped by jazz\u2019s openness, the music charts a shared space where genres blur, listening deepens, and new possibilities quietly emerge. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Humour and elegance share the stage!\u00a0 \nLakshmi Girish and Parvathi Jayaram, a newly formed duo, explore a classical form through a modern lens.

    "description": "Hidden within Gujarat\u2019s landscape is the living memory of the malunga: a sacred musical bow of the African-Indian Sidi community, whose sound carries histories of migration, faith, and resilience. This event opens a rare window into a niche cultural world in India, where music is not performance alone, but inheritance. Through documentary and dialogue, it introduces the Sidis as Sufi Muslims of the Rifa\u2019i tariqa, rooted in the spiritual lineage of Bava Gor, the fourteenth-century saint from Nubia who journey and settled in India. \nThe evening begins with a screening of The Sidi Malunga Project: Rejuvenating the African Musical Bow in India (2002), by Amy Catlin-Jairazbhoy and Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy: a\u00a0film that documents not only the malunga\u2019s near-disappearance, but also captures the\u00a0extraordinary moment of revival\u00a0that brought elders and youth together to ensure its survival. The screening is followed by a presentation of the newly formed Sidi Culture and Heritage Trust, outlining ongoing efforts to sustain Sidi musical, spiritual, and cultural life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rare window into a living, resilient culture: a musical world few know, but many will remember. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "A simple, resonant idea turned into an immersive, evocative performance. \nLed by vocalist Samarth Nagarkar, this programme looks at khayal\u00a0as a tradition shaped by centuries of dialogue through devotional song, folk expression, courtly aesthetics, and theatrical imagination. Light, space, and sound work together to draw listeners into the unfolding emotional landscape of the raag. \nMusic endures not by remaining closed, but by absorbing, listening, and transforming. This evening\u2019s performance is a true testament to the trends that have become tradition. \nSupported by: \n \n",
