Rakesh continues to place his faith in these traditional methods, while Ganesh embraces modern fishing technologies in search of more secure returns. As climate change renders the sea increasingly unpredictable, the pressure to provide for their families begins to fracture their once-unshakeable friendship. \nA deeply human story set against the vast, changing waters of the Arabian Sea, Against the Tide explores the collision of tradition and technology, community and survival, through the intimate bond between two men as close as brothers. \nThe film was selected for the Sundance Film Festival 2023 \u2013 World Cinema Documentary Competition, where it received widespread acclaim for its lyrical storytelling and urgent relevance. \nThe screening will be followed by a conversation between the Director, Sarvnik Kaur and Sunanda Bhat, along with an audience Q&A. \nProduction Crew:Director & Producer \u2013 Sarvnik KaurProducer \u2013 Koval BhatiaCo-Producer \u2013 Quentin LaurentEditing \u2013 Atanas GeorgievEditing \u2013 Blagoja NedelkovskiSound Design \u2013 Moinak Bose \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "15 minutes | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 | India \nHuliyappa is a short documentary in Kannada by first-time filmmaker, Sourabha Rao. Shot entirely in the remote hamlets of the Uttara Kannada district, the film is centred around an ancient custom of worshipping the eponymous tiger deity during Deepavali, for the protection of people and their livestock from large Carnivora \u2013 tigers, leopards and bears. \nThe film reveals the losses faced by the residents of this thickly forested Western Ghats landscape to themselves and their prized cattle due to incidents with wildlife, and the surprising tolerance, forgiveness and compassion that prevail in people despite them. It is an exploration of the mythical, emotional and rational origins of the remarkable faith. Through conversations with people from various strata of the local society, including scholars, farmers and cowherds, Rao makes a concise and compelling retelling of a culture that has maintained the unlikeliest harmony between humans and wildlife in the region for centuries, and documents the simple rituals that constitute it. \nRather soberingly, Huliyappa is also a timely reminder of the dire need to impress such indigenous practices upon a generation increasingly disconnected from its roots, if the equilibrium with Nature, so pivotal to the future of humanity, is to be vouchsafed. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with the team that made the film, in conversation with Sonu Venugopal. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis screening is part of BIC\u2019s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience.\u00a0This year\u2019s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change, communities whose lives are entangled with the land, the waters, and the skies, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience.\u00a0Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n",

    "description": "If the century spanning 1850 to 1950 was that of Tyagaraja, the next one undoubtedly belongs to Muthuswami Dikshitar. He has been the subject of the same intense study that his illustrious contemporary was previously. The corpus of his songs in public circulation has gone up tremendously during this period, though debates continue on the genuineness of some of these. This is exactly the way Tyagaraja kritis went up in circulation and publications were churned out on them from the mid-19th century onwards. Dikshitar like a late-blooming flower is slowly unfurling petal after petal, revealing some, but not all the facets of his personality. There is something about him that seems to speak to the 21st century mind. \nThis lecture by Historian, V Sriram will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. \nPresented by:\n \n",

    "description": "Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India\u2019s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of \u2018direct benefits\u2019 which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session, Louise Tillin, the author of the book, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Discover the raw, immersive power of Doddata, a ritualistic folk theatre tradition from North Karnataka that fuses storytelling, spiritual invocation, music, and movement. Also known as Moodalakatte Bayalata, Doddata is a performance form rooted in village life, where the stage is sacred and every gesture resonates with centuries of lived belief. Presented by GK Kala Vedike, Hubballi and led by Ramesh, this evening offers an intimate and interactive introduction to a tradition where drama is both prayer and pedagogy. \nThrough live demonstrations and audience engagement, the session traces Doddata\u2019s transformation from a ritual offering into a full-bodied dramatic experience. You\u2019ll witness the vibrant Ranga Pooje (stage worship), learn about the significance of traditional instruments like the chende and maddale, and explore the layered symbolism of costume, mudras, and movement. The audience will be invited to participate through chanting invocations, mirroring expressive gestures, and stepping briefly into the performative world of gods, demons, kings, and jesters. The evening culminates in a 20-minute performance of Shalyarajana Saarathya, a tale from the Mahabharata, allowing audiences to experience the full emotional and spiritual arc of this powerful tradition. \nDoddata is not just a theatrical form but a repository of memory, identity, and pedagogy, passed on through generations by rural communities. While modernisation poses challenges to its continuity, programs such as the one being presented, play a vital role in sustaining and revitalising this precious art form. \nThis is not just a performance, it\u2019s an invitation to enter a space where art, ritual, and community converge. Whether you\u2019re a lover of theatre, a student of culture, or simply curious about Karnataka\u2019s rich traditions, Doddata\u00a0promises a rare, resonant encounter with a living legacy. \nThis is the third performance of our series\u00a0BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka\u2019s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression.\u00a0Through demonstrations, performances, and academic discussions, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "India has over a lakh rice varieties \u2013 each with its own story. A grain that can ease certain illnesses. Another that grows tall enough to hide elephants. One that needs no cooking. A variety so flavourful it\u2019s eaten plain. A Goan rice that thrives during floods. Yet, most of these never reach markets or our kitchens, slipping out of everyday memory and conversation. This workshop, led by Anumitra from Edible Archives, invites participants to explore the edible archive within themselves \u2013 the foods and tastes we carry in our bodies and memories. Through a guided rice appreciation session featuring indigenous rice varieties, we\u2019ll learn to observe differences in texture, aroma, and flavour while uncovering the stories behind each grain. \nThe workshop is a space to reflect on the connections between food, place, and identity. It will also open up conversations about what gets lost when agricultural biodiversity disappears, and why bringing these grains back to our plates matters. \nIn collaboration with Edible Archives:\u00a0Edible Archives, an award-winning restaurant and art /research project based in Anjuna, Goa, works with indigenous ingredients at the intersection of art, culture and food. Edible Archives was one of the Infra Projects at the Kochi Muziris Biennale 2018-19, where it showcased 30 varieties of indigenous rice in 3 months. Since then, Edible Archives has been at the forefront of the ingredient-driven movement in India. With its focus on indigenous varieties, local and seasonal ingredients, and innovative cuisine-agnostic menus that change with the seasons, it has been introducing visitors to an intriguing world of local foods as never imagined before. Most recently, Edible Archives was the winner of the national Outlook Responsible Tourism Awards 2025, both in the Sustainable Food category and as the Overall Winner. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \nThis workshop is part of BIC\u2019s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled\u00a0The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience.\u00a0This year\u2019s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change, communities whose lives are entangled with the land, the waters, and the skies, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience.\u00a0Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n",

    "description": "Francis Newton Souza, one of the most provocative and unflinching voices in modern Indian art, challenged the conventions of both European and Indian art traditions. In her new book F.N. Souza: The Archetypal Artist, academic and art critic Janeita Singh offers a deeply interdisciplinary reading of Souza\u2019s life and work, drawing on Jungian analysis, mythology, religion, and philosophy, to examine how Souza confronted the collective unconscious through his art. \nIn this session, she presents the key ideas from her book and then engages in a conversation with art historian Annapurna Garimella to explore how Souza\u2019s expressionism defied colonial and religious authority, reclaimed the fragmented self, and questioned the ideological foundations of modernism. Together, they will reflect on the urgency of rethinking art history from decolonial and non-Western perspectives, and how Souza\u2019s work, with its blend of eroticism, irreverence, and rage, continues to challenge dominant narratives of aesthetics, identity, and power. \nThe conversation will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "52 minutes | English and Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 | India \nIndia\u2019s smooth-coated otters are captivating animals with distinct characters and intricate social lives. In this documentary, wildlife filmmaker Sugandhi Gadadhar explores the playful and resilient lives of an otter family residing in one of India\u2019s most rapidly changing waterways. \nThe banks of the River Cauvery are where Sugandhi spent her childhood holidays. The memories of those times and her fleeting glimpses of the mysterious animals dipping below the waterline have fascinated her ever since. \nNow she is back and with the help of Shivu, a local fisherman, is following Maya, a female otter, and her family in the hope of documenting their family dynamics, challenges, and achievements. But the otters are wary of her presence. They have learnt that staying elusive means staying alive. \nShivu grew up along the banks of the river Cauvery. He not only helps Sugandhi navigate the waters but also opens her eyes to the lives of fishermen and the problems they face.\nAs pollution and destructive dynamite fishing threaten the delicate balance of their habitat, the otters and the fishermen, whose livelihoods also depend on the river, are often in conflict. \nNot many people know that otters exist in India. An otter is to a river what a tiger is to a forest. They are the apex predators in the river. Set along the picturesque landscape of the river Cauvery in southern India, this film captures never-before-filmed otter behaviour while subtly articulating the conflict that is brewing. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers and Shivu. \nThis screening is part of BIC\u2019s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled\u00a0The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience.\u00a0This year\u2019s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change, communities whose lives are entangled with the land, the waters, and the skies, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience.\u00a0Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n",

    "description": "25 minutes (2 films) | Bengali and Tamil with English Subtitles |\u00a0India | 2024 \nThe films are part of a series Breaking the Nets: An oral history of India\u2019s fisherwomen.\u00a0At the heart of the fishing industry is the invisible labour of women.\u00a0Over 12.3 million women in India work in fishing\u2014 catching, farming, processing, and selling fish, mending nets, and maintaining fishing gear. But their contribution is largely unacknowledged.\u00a0Fisherwomen have fought to get recognition for their labour and secure their rights.\u00a0\u201cBreaking the Nets\u201d brings stories from across India that chronicle the discriminations fisherwomen have faced, the battles they have waged, and the solutions they have crafted. \nFilm 1: This Jungle is Ours \n12 min | Bengali with English subtitles\nUrmila Sardar saw a tiger drag her husband away while they were fishing in the Sundarbans. Parul Haldar had to abandon building a temple dedicated to the forest deity when her husband was killed by a tiger.\u00a0Still, they defy the Forest Department to work in this mangrove forest, facing the threat of tigers, crocodiles, and snakes.\u00a0Catching fish and crab has been the sole means for women here to earn a living. With the creation of the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve, the government has restricted people\u2019s access to the forest, and made women\u2019s jobs difficult. Increased frequency of storms and cyclones caused by climate change has added to their woes.\u00a0Now, fisherwomen are demanding customary harvest rights in Sundarban. \nFilm 2: The Sea is our Mother\n13 min | Tamil with English subtitles\nNamma Thayi has been diving in the Gulf of Mannar to pick seaweed since she was seven. She couldn\u2019t miss work even when heavily pregnant. On one such dive, she delivered her child on an island. Today, as a frail 80-year-old, she still goes to the sea to collect seaweed.\u00a0The women around the islands of Gulf of Mannar have carved a niche for themselves as India\u2019s sole wild seaweed harvesters. For them, diving in the sea is not an act of recreation or adventure, but a means to their livelihood.\u00a0With the creation of the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, their places of work have come under legal protection for their rich biodiversity. The National Park is also a \u2018no-take\u2019 zone, denying them their traditional fishing grounds and seaweed beds. Over 5,000 seaweed collectors have their livelihoods at stake.\u00a0How do women dependent on protected areas survive in the time of conservation? \nThis project is created by a \u2018tiny team\u2019 of three independent journalists Shamsheer Yousaf, Monica Jha, and Sriram Vittalamurthy. They did everything from reporting, writing, shooting and editing photos and videos, and producing multimedia stories, debugging the code and troubleshooting.\u00a0It was supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers and Lakshmi Murthy, a seaweed harvester turned leader. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \nThis screening is part of BIC\u2019s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled\u00a0The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience.\u00a0This year\u2019s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change, communities whose lives are entangled with the land, the waters, and the skies, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience.\u00a0Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n",

    "description": "What happens when a defiant chronicler and an idealist revolutionary converge in the\u00a0playground that is India\u2019s freedom struggle? Urdu newspaper Pratap, launched in pre-partition India, was a torchbearer against the British Raj. The man who publicly defended it\u00a0against colonial censorship was none other than Jawaharlal Nehru. \nThe pen picked up by freedom fighter Virendra, the paper\u2019s editor and the founder\u2019s son who once walked shoulder to shoulder with stalwarts like Bhagat Singh was equally fearless\u00a0despite threats by the imperial government, Indira Gandhi\u2019s Emergency and a parcel bomb\u00a0sent to Pratap\u2019s office during terrorism in Punjab. \nVirendra was first arrested in the historic Saunders murder case. He was also in jail with\u00a0Bhagat Singh the day the legendary revolutionary was hanged, sharing a rare first-hand\u00a0witness account. In Independent India, too footsteps filled Pratap and its editors with dread\u00a0and terror. \nPratap: A Defiant Newspaper is a timely reminder of the ethos of a struggle, a template for\u00a0speaking truth to power at all costs. It is the story of a perfect storm. The book is written by Virendra\u2019s son, distinguished editor Chander Mohan and journalist granddaughter Jyotsna Mohan. Jyotsna and Azeezullah Baig will be in conversation with Maya Sharma. There will be a Q&A session with the audience. \n",
