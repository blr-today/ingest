    "description": "90 Minutes | Kannada | For Ages 16 years and above \nYogi Mattu Bhogi is a free adaptation of the 7th-century play, Bhagavadajjukam (Sanskrit, \u2018bhagavat\u2019 \u2013 hermit; \u2018ajjuka\u2019 \u2013 harlot), also known in English as The Ascetic and The Courtesan. One of the oldest surviving plays in Sanskrit literature, it is a fine example of a \u2018prahasana\u2019, or farce. Layered in witty exchanges about dharma, it is centered around the transmigration of souls between the two titular characters leading to confusion and chaos for the supporting characters who have no answer to the absurdity of it all. \nThrough this retelling in Kannada, Mahesh Dattani, plays around with the idea of gender: its expression, perception, spectrum and the exploration of what one truly is with a confrontation of stereotypes using humour and catharsis. Infused with Yakshagana, the play comes alive when the classic Sanskrit text and the physicality of theatre gels seamlessly with the traditional dance theatre form from coastal Karnataka. \nCredits:\nAdaptation and Direction:\u00a0Mahesh Dattani\nKannada Translation: Vishvajith Madhavamurthy\nYakshagana Choreography:\u00a0Guru Bannanje Sanjeev Suvarna\nMusic Composition:\u00a0Poornima Bhojraj\nSet Design: Mahesh Dattani\nLight Design: Trisha Shetty, Bhavya Bharadwaj, Pallavi Kodagu\nLights Execution: Trisha Shetty, Bhavya Bharadwaj\nCostume Design: Shruti Bangera\nMusic: Amrit P\nProduction Manager: Venumadhav Bhat\n(Initial) Poster Design: Gopalkrishna Bhat\n(Initial) Poster Artwork:\u00a0Shruti Bangera\nAssistant Directors: Trisha Shetty and Kritika Verma\nProduction Assistants: Atharv Mishra and Amrutha \nAbout Punaha Theatre:\nPunaha, a theatre company based in Udupi, is dedicated to the art of storytelling through the transformative power of performance. \u2018Punaha\u2019, is derived from the Kannada\u00a0(\u03a3\u0ca8\u0c83), Hindi (\u092a\u0941\u0928\u0903) and Sanskrit word, meaning \u201crepeat,\u201d or \u201cto do it again\u201d. They are a group of professional theatre artists, academicians, and working professionals who love theatre, and the idea of repetition and riyaaz involved in it. \u2018Punaha\u2019 symbolizes their commitment to revisit and reimagine classic narratives while exploring contemporary themes that resonate with today\u2019s audience. It also is the idea of us as humans trying, failing but definitely starting again, starting Punaha.\u00a0Among their ongoing productions are Girish Karnad\u2019s Agni Aur Barkha (translated into Hindi by Ram Gopal Bajaj) and Harold Pinter\u2019s The Caretaker. Agni Aur Barkha was previously adapted to the stage in Kannada as Agni Mattu Male. Yogi Mattu Bhogi is our fourth production overall in collaboration with Sahitya Akademi awardee, Mahesh Dattani. Punaha hopes to create a thriving theatre culture in the small coastal city of Udupi, develop their plays thriftily and tour them to other cities, big and small. Reflecting the multilinguistic atmosphere of the city, their intention is to not be bound by the constraints of a single language, producing plays primarily in English, Hindi, and Kannada. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "This talk by commences by introducing the audience to the sacred bronzes created by a master sculptor around the year 1000, and suggests that his inspiration may well have been child-saint Sambandar\u2019s opening hymn that hails god Shiva as \u201cthe thief who stole my heart.\u201d \nVidya Dehejia explores this sensuous imagery before moving to ask questions of this material that have not been asked before. Where did the Cholas acquire the copper required to cast the many temple bronzes that are solid heavy pieces of metal? Why were the Cholas obsessed with island Sri Lanka? What were the circumstances that permitted the creation of hundreds of temples and vast numbers of sacred bronzes despite the constant warfare that the Chola monarchs were engaged in? What was the source of the extraordinarily vast number of pearls that, together with coral, rubies and diamonds, were embedded in gold jewelry gifted to adorn temple bronzes? Why did the Cholas cover the walls of their temple walls with inscriptions\u2013 some 13,000 in total \u2013 using temple walls as if they were the public records office? \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n",

The film features an ensemble cast including Anant Nag, Shabana Azmi (in her Kannada debut), and Amol Palekar. \nSet in 1920s India, the story follows Kanneshwara Rama, a defiant peasant who becomes a legendary outlaw after confronting local injustice. After a prison stint where he encounters Gandhi\u2019s followers, he joins and eventually leads a group of bandits, becoming a Robin Hood-like figure who aids the poor and challenges feudal authority. His journey is complicated by his relationship with Malli, a former bandit\u2019s mistress, and his growing ambition to establish his own principality. \nThe film, which was later screened at the 2017 Bengaluru International Film Festival, explores themes of rebellion, justice, and loyalty against the backdrop of India\u2019s independence movement.

Ephemerality and constant adaptation are woven into Indian philosophies, religions, and customs \u2013 whether darshan with a deity, drawing with powdered rangoli or kolams in the early morning, chanting a mantra, practicing yoga, immersing oneself in Aarthi or in offerings to the Divine. Each requires a pause in the rush of daily life. Duty to others, to society, and to the future, is suspended for the moment of being present. \nStephen Huyler has spent his life observing and listening, mesmerized by these very Indian expressions, resulting in six illustrated books, and over 25 museum exhibitions abroad as well as in India. \nThis session draws on Huyler\u2019s book Transformed By India,\u00a0exploring his many encounters, from maharajahs to musicians, Dalits to Brahmins, politicians to potters,\u00a0from layered traditions to recent innovations, of India\u2019s momentary arts. \nStephen Huyler will be in conversation with Sandhya Mendonca. This will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Of all regions of India, the Deccan has the most diverse architectural traditions, nowhere better shown than in the variety of stone temples sponsored under a succession of dynasties which ruled peninsular India over some 700 years. To illustrate this unique diversity, Michell explores religious monuments at lesser-known sites. He begins with Early Chalukya temples overlooking the Tungabhadra river at Alampur, and ends with the imposing Kakatiya monument at the out of the way village of Palampet, both in Telangana. In between, he discusses the Nolamaba period shrines at Nandi and Shravana Belgola, and those of the Later Chalukyas at Sudi, Kuruvatti and Lakkundi, all in Karnataka. He concludes with the little visited Hoysala period shrines at Belavadi, Mosale and Agraha Bachhahalli. \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A Session with the audience. \nImage credit \u2013 Surendra Kumar \nIn collaboration with:\n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "The concert pays homage to the Goddess Saraswati, revered through the ages as the embodiment of the four essentials of a discerning human life: Speech (Vaani), the foundation of communication and expression; Music (Sangeet), the universal language of harmony and emotion; Wisdom (Buddhi), the guiding light of understanding and insight; and Discrimination (Vivek), the power to discern and choose wisely. \nThrough a journey of timeless raags and original compositions, our musicians delve into these eternal qualities, reflecting the grace and profundity that the Goddess represents. This celebration is not just a tribute to Saraswati but a call to connect with the divine essence of creativity, intellect, and balance within us all. \nSupported by: \n \n",
