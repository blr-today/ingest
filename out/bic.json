    "description": "This session\u00a0presents an enthralling journey through the rich history of the sitar, beginning with its origins and evolution across centuries. The performance explores the sitar\u2019s creation from natural elements, merging Persian and Indian musical traditions to symbolize its sacred and timeless nature. As the sitar travels through royal courts, it becomes a symbol of refinement and cultural prestige, before eventually establishing itself as a central instrument in Indian classical music. This concert highlights the transformation, showcasing the sitar\u2019s rise as a solo instrument and its deep connection to Indian music. \nHonoring the contributions of legendary sitarists like Ustad Vilayat Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar, this performance will illustrate their groundbreaking innovations that shaped the sitar\u2019s modern identity and global influence. From classical Indian ragas to cross-cultural experiments, the sitar\u2019s role in contemporary music will be explored, demonstrating its versatility and ongoing relevance in world music. Through a blend of storytelling and music, this performance celebrates the instrument\u2019s enduring legacy and its profound impact on both classical and global music. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "\n54 minutes |\u00a0English, Hindi, Kannada | Suitable for 13+ Years\nTrigger Warnings: Themes of Loneliness\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDo you ever feel alone, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends\u2026 Yet, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together, drifting apart, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise\u2026 \nThis is an adaptation of \u201cBh\u016bmikampa \u2013 Das Erdbeben\u201d which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n\u201cMira and Sameer find themselves on a bench, surrounded by unspoken words. \u2018The Earthquake\u2019 delves into the essence of human relationships\u2014our connections, routines, distances, and all the spaces in between. It asks us what it means to be truly seen or heard. What happens when we finally face the unspoken truths in our interpersonal relationships?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0 \nCredits: \nPlaywrights: Marvin Krause and Samragni Dasgupta\nDirector: Samragni Dasgupta \nCast: \nMira: Yamuna Kali\nSameer: Naman Roy \nThe Earthquake received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt M\u00fcnchen Kulturreferat (City of Munich). \nProduced by\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nWith Support from \n\n \n\n",
