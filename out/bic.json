    "description": "Sound hits your eardrums. Percussion resonates through your entire body. \nPercussionist Rahul Vanamali starts there. He walks you through two instruments: the vibraphone and the snare drum. Their histories and techniques. Then works that have never been performed in India.\u00a0Pieces that pull sounds you didn\u2019t know these instruments could make. \nThen he hands you the sticks. \nYou\u2019ll feel how a whisper-touch on a drum head creates depth. How striking the same bar in different spots shifts the tone. Sound, yes. But also vibration traveling up your arms, the hum settling in your ribs. After that, the room plays together. Rahul has arranged ensemble passages that work even if you\u2019ve never held a mallet before. Sync with strangers into a rhythm you can feel in the floor. \nRahul spent years discovering these instruments, jolted by wonder when sound became something physical. It is your turn now! \nPlease Note: Limited to 20 participants per session. \nSession Schedule:\n11am \u2013 12noon\n12:30pm \u2013 1:30pm\n2:30pm \u2013 3:30pm\n4:30pm \u2013 5:30pm \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

    "description": "Nobody said the afterlife would be fair. \nTwo enemy soldiers die in battle and find themselves at the same border crossing into the afterlife. The officer in charge is a Postman Aunty with a pet goldfish and a makeshift post office that serves both sides of the conflict equally. As the soldiers navigate what comes next, letters from the war begin to surface. Masks shift, puppets move, bodies speak. \nDirector Yuki Ellias built a show without words, letting movement do the work. Sofiyum, a Sikkimese band, fills the stage with music that weaves Lepcha folk traditions into something entirely its own. The songs, created in Lepcha with the Dur See Brothers, give the show a sound world as specific and ethereal as its setting. \nCold mountains. A border cutting through no man\u2019s land. A goldfish. And somewhere in the middle of all of it, peace feels close, just like a spring morning. \nProduction Credits:\nStory, Direction, Actor: Yuki Ellias\nActor, Choreographer: Tapas Boro\nMusic and Sound: Sofiyum Band: Mickma Tshering Lepcha, Ongyal Tshering Lepcha, Noel J.

    "description": "A performance of Western classical music. But not quite your traditional piano recital. \nThe pieces are famous. Debussy, Scarlatti, Liszt, Grieg, Brahms, Sorabji, Copland. You may have heard some of them before. That is the point. Repetition does not preserve meaning, it changes it. The same notes, heard again, evoke different emotions. \nEach piece arrives with a scent. The music reaches you through the ear. The fragrance reaches you somewhere you can\u2019t quite name. Between the two, something surfaces: the specific, vivid kind of memory that belongs only to you. \nWoven through is a conversation about music, scent and sensation: how memory is invoked without words, without warning, without intention. \nThe piano is waiting. \n \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

Du\u1e63yanta mirrors the deer. His responses echo \u015aakuntal\u0101\u2019s movements. What emerges is emotions synchronizing across bodies, a complementary interplay that grew from attempting the impossible. \nK\u016b\u1e6diy\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dam stretches time. A gesture can last minutes. A glance becomes an entire emotional landscape. What you see is intensity, immediacy, and a particular kind of attention. \nK\u0101lid\u0101sa.

    "description": "Born from a vision to unite masters and experimentalists on a single stage, Prav\u0101ha debuted in 2024. The second edition of this festival, The Body As Space, explores how we experience the world through sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. \nOver eight days, the festival becomes a journey through sensation. Classical melodies meet olfactory landscapes. Contemporary dance transforms into tactile dialogue. Installations immerse you in sound, scent, and memory itself. Conversations uncover India\u2019s forgotten sensory archives and trace the origins of instruments that changed how we listen. \nWe invite you to tune into what you\u2019ve always carried: the intelligence of your body, the stories held in your senses. \nRSVP for the events you\u2019d like to attend here. \nFestival Schedule: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\nArtist\nNature\nTimings\n\n\nFeb 22 \u2013 Mar 1\nHistories of Indian Perfume\nOn a Scented Trail\nThe Marg Foundation\nExhibition\n11am \u2013 9pm\n\n\nFeb 22 \u2013 Mar 1\nFirst-Hand\nA Multisensorial Pause for Rest, Attention, and Care\nFor Ages 15+\nNitish Jain\nPaticipatory Immersive Experience\nFeb 22 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 23 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 24 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 25 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 26 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 27 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 28 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\nMar 1 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nV\u0101san\u00e9\nOlfactory Archives of Bangalore\nIndu Antony\nLecture Demonstration\n11:30am \u2013 1pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nGrounded: A Food and Body Coffee Lab\nA Sensorial Exploration of Coffee, Memory, and Land\nShubhra Chatterji\nWorkshop\n4pm \u2013 6:30pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nTHOL\nReconstructing Tamil Antiquity Through Revived Instruments and Contemporary Songwriting\nUrupaanar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 23\nCall of the Flute\nA Coming Together of Pichwai Paintings, Kuchipudi Dance, and Flute\nAmrita Lahiri, Shan Bhatnagar & Hrishikesh Majumdar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 24\nNotes That Linger\nSounds and Scents Mingling in the Evening Air\nKarl Lutchmayer\nImmersive Performance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 25\nThe Far Post\nPhysical Theatre With Masks, Puppetry and Music\nFor Ages 12+\nYuki Ellias, Priyanshu Gupta, Sumaiya Merchant, Mati Rajput, Arnob Bal, Phalguni Vittal Rao, Priyanka Babbar & Sanket Parkhe\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 26\nNavrasa and I\nReliving the Rasas Through Raagas\nIndrayuddh Majumdar & Roopak Kallurkar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 9pm\n\n\nFeb 27\nA Woman Or Not to Be\nA Bold Reimagining of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet Through the Eyes of a Woman\nFor Ages 12+\nAdishakti Laboratory for Theatre Art Research\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nThe Percussive Pathway\nA Brief Foray into the Wondrous World of Percussion\nRahul Vanamali\nInteractive Performance & Workshop\n11am\n12:30pm\n2:30pm\n4:30pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nMaking the Ephemeral\nHistories of Indian Perfume\nJames McHugh, Giti Datt & Ahalya Matthan\nDiscussion\n11:30am \u2013 1pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nKadahin Milandaasin |\n\u06aa\u068f\u0647\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646\nA Jazz Quartet Weaving Memory into Music\nTarun Balani, Sonja Ott, Siddharth Gautam & Luke Marantz\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nMar 1\nFuture Food Taste Test\nWhat\u2019s in Our Climate Pantry?\nEdible Issues\nWorkshop\n4pm \u2013 6pm\n\n\nMar 1\nAbhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam: The Circle of Love\nA K\u016b\u1e6diy\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dam Performance Where Love Blossoms\nNepathya\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 9pm\n\n\n\nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "You know this story. \nA death in the royal family. A ghost with demands. A protagonist tipping toward madness, or something that looks like it. Revenge as the only logical conclusion. \nPut a woman in the centre. The axis shifts. \nDoes the ghost get believed? Does the grief get room, or a diagnosis? And what happens when the ghost doesn\u2019t ask for revenge at all, but tells her daughter to protect herself through education? \nPrincess Hamlet is twenty, home from college, fluent in manga and martial arts, and entirely unprepared for what her mother\u2019s ghost is asking of her. Adishakti\u2019s production departs sharply from Shakespeare, and in that departure, asks what we\u2019ve always taken for granted about grief, power, and who gets to act on either. \nWritten, adapted and directed by Vinay Kumar. Nimmy Raphel plays a Hamlet the original never imagined. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year\u2019s festival is built around what we hear, smell, touch, taste, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music, contemporary dance, installations, and conversations. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Scent travels across time. You just don\u2019t think about it that way. \nA whiff of jasmine connects you to rituals performed two thousand years ago. Sandalwood routes that crossed continents. Rose attar distilled using techniques older than most written records.\u00a0Perfume holds ecology, trade, memory, and craft in a single drop. \nJames McHugh lectures on smell in early Indian religion and culture. How scent functioned in ritual. How aromatics were understood, classified, traded across ancient networks. Then, a conversation with Bengaluru-based perfumer Ahalya Matthan and anthropologist-perfumer Giti Datt. They work with traditional attars, the concentrated fragrances India has been making for centuries. You\u2019ll hear about the science behind distillation, the artistry in blending, the labor in every bottle. \nHistory, distilled. \nThe session will be followed by a walkthrough of the Histories of Indian Perfume exhibition by James McHugh at 3pm. \nImage credits: \nThumbnail \u2013\u00a0Full bhapkas sitting in the corner of a distillery, so that the distillate can settle overnight.

Although produced within India, these richly perfumed stamens were costly by virtue of the intense labor involved in producing them.

    "description": "For over forty years, legendary British designer Dame Zandra Rhodes and Indian design visionary Rajeev Sethi have shared a rare creative partnership rooted in friendship, curiosity, and cross-cultural exchange. From the landmark Festival of India exhibitions to collaborations with artisans across the subcontinent, their work has reimagined how traditional craft, contemporary design, and global aesthetics can meet. \nIn this special conversation, Rhodes and Sethi reflect on journeys through India\u2019s textile traditions, experiments that bridged craft and couture, and the communities of makers whose skills shaped their work. They will discuss the evolving role of design in sustaining cultural heritage, the transformative power of collaboration, and the personal bond that has sustained their creative dialogue across decades. \nRich with stories of travel, experimentation, and shared vision, this session offers a rare glimpse into a friendship that helped reshape global conversations around craft, fashion, and cultural diplomacy. \nImages:\nThumbnail, Header and Poster: Early photographs of Zandra Rhodes and Rajeev Sethi preparing for the Festival of India in 1981. \n",

    "description": "A dark body draped in yellow. Flower garland, peacock feather. You know the image. \nWhen Lord Krishna plays his flute, everything bends toward that sound. The cow freezes mid-graze, standing on one leg. The gopi stops mid-task. The lotus pauses mid-bloom. For centuries, Indian artists have followed that call. \nPichwai comes from Rajasthan\u2019s temple havelis, worship made visible on cloth. Kuchipudi from Andhra\u2019s villages, stories told through the body. Opposite ends of India, both Vaishnavite traditions holding the same images sacred. \nTogether on stage is an unlikely trio: Pichwai painter Shan Bhatnagar, Kuchipudi dancer Amrita Lahiri, flautist Hrishikesh Majumdar. Each devoted to their form, each form devoted to Krishna.\u00a0Bhatnagar walks you through his paintings between dance pieces. Lahiri responds, those frozen moments coming alive through movement. Majumdar\u2019s flute ties it together, the sound that makes devotion inevitable. \nNorth and South. Stillness and motion. The call and the answer. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year\u2019s festival is built around what we hear, smell, touch, taste, and see.

    "description": "Some homelands you\u2019ve never seen, but you long for them anyway. \nComposer and drummer Tarun Balani never set foot in Sindh. Yet he knows it through his grandmother\u2019s stories, through words in a half-remembered language, through melodies that surfaced decades after Partition. \nThe Tarun Balani Quartet features trumpeter Sonja Ott, guitarist Siddharth Gautam, pianist Luke Marantz. Four musicians from four countries playing music about belonging nowhere and everywhere at once. Contemporary jazz meets Sindhi folk. Improvisation meets tradition. The sound shifts the way memory does when you try to hold it still. \nFamily archives and oral histories thread through the performance. Live improvisation responds to what the room holds. You\u2019ll be invited to offer something: a memory, a word in a language slipping away, an image of a place you carry. The quartet takes it in. Lets it shape the music. What you share stays, becomes part of what everyone else hears. \nKadahin Milandaasin. When will we meet? \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.
