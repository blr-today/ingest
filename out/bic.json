    "description": "Kattam Katti transports you to Uttarayan, the world-famous kite festival in Gujurat, North India, where millions of people from different cities, religions, and social classes come together to fly kites, marking the transition from winter into spring.  \nTapping into the competitive chaos, creativity, and colour of the event, the show brings to life the excitement of Uttarayan with lyricism, drama, and exquisite technique. It illustrates the highs and lows, loves and losses of the lives that are lived out among the festivities. Kite flying becomes a metaphor for the injustice of unevenly distributed privilege, in both the corporate world and society more generally.\u00a0 \nChoreography: Urja Desai Thakore\nSet Design: Simon Daw\nLighting Design: Hector Murray\nDramaturgy: Lou Cope\nCostume Design: Urja Desai Thakore, Simon Daw, and Abha Desai Original Creative Producer: Nina Head\nCreative Producer: Lia Prentaki\nProduction Manager: Salvatore Scollo\nStage Manager: Ben Gray\nSound Engineer: Camilo Tirado\nLighting Technician: Chris Burr\u00a0 \nSpecial thanks to Alap Desai, Chitra Sundaram, Michael Hulls, Parbati Chaudhry, Madhusoodanan Satchithannandan , Nina Head, and Eva Martinez\u00a0 \nCommissioned by Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre, London.

    "description": "Dante Beyond Borders is an Italian Indian co-production born from the collaboration between Instabili Vaganti and Ahum Trust and inspired by the Divine Comedy of the great Italian Poet Dante Alighieri, on the occasion of his 700 years death\u2019s anniversary. \nThe performance explores different artistic languages: experimental theatre, dance, cinema, video art and electronic music in order to bring the spectator into the otherworldly journey made by Dante. The sounds of Dante\u2019s ancient Italian language meet the mudras and gestures of\u00a0 the traditional Bharatanatyam dance, accompanied by the contemporary electronic soundscapes originally composed by the Oscar winning Italian musician Riccardo Nanni, around the leading suggestion of the Absence, an element that permeates Dante\u2019s works. \nThe evocative physical actions of the performer Nicola Pianzola and the dance of Anuradha Venkataraman interact with the videos realised by the artists of the project through a remote collaboration developed during the lockdown. \nThe performance aims to explore the\u00a0 numerous connections between Dante\u2019s work and Indian culture, both from an iconographic, philosophical and theological point of view. \nDirection: Anna Dora Dorno\nDramaturgy: Anna Dora Dorno, Nicola Pianzola\nPerformers: Nicola Pianzola, Anuradha Venkataraman\nChoreography: Anuradha Venkataraman, Nicola\u00a0Pianzola\nPerformance in video, original songs and voice over: Anna\u00a0Dora Dorno, Nicola Pianzola, Anuradha Venkataraman\nOriginal music and sound design: Riccardo Nanni\nVideo creation: Anna Dora Dorno, Nicola Pianzola,\u00a0Ashwin Iyer\nSet and Light design: Anna Dora Dorno\nProduction: Istituto Italiano di cultura in Mumbai, Instabili Vaganti, Ahum Trust\nSupporters: MIC Ministry of culture / Istituto Italiano di cultura in New Delhi \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n",

This requires nuance. Reflecting on some of the journeys they have taken with the practice of Inclusive Arts in Asia, they will show how collaborative practices, first developed alongside neurodiverse people and people with learning disabilities, have become relevant to collaborating with a wide range of people. \nThe talk will then seek to answer the following provocations using some practical participatory\u00a0activities: \n\nHow do we travel at the speed of trust using forms of Inclusive Arts practice?\nWhat\u2019s next for Inclusive Art? How might we \u2018come into being\u2019 inclusively with each\u00a0other, our art materials and the environment?\n\nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "*This work contains scenes that explore mature themes. Viewer discretion is advised.* \nThe irreverent\u00a0That\u2019s All Folks!, premiered at the Equilibrio Festival 2024 and draws inspiration from cartoons. In a minimalist set, a quartet of international performers\u2014Damiano Ottavio Bigi, Ching-Ying Chien, Issue Park, and Faith Prendergast\u2014explore a work that blends dance, science, and myth. Inspired by the concept of the \u2018event horizon,\u2019 it delves into physical vertigo, the fall, and being drawn into a space where perspective shifts and everything changes depending on where we look. \nThis project continues the themes of Un Discreto Protagonista, expanding the conversation on choreographic writing and artistic composition. While the previous work focused on the universe\u2019s origins and astronomical processes, this piece shifts to humanity\u2019s relationship with the cosmos. \nWorking with a quartet of dancers, the team explored two distinct paths. The first centers on a \u201cpurely physical narrative,\u201d using complex movement patterns to create a thematic structure that unfolds gradually. This investigation draws on ritual forms connected to founding myths and cosmology, balancing irrationality with control and chaos with logic to explore interconnected spatial and dimensional relationships. \nThe second path constructs four characters suspended in an undefined space\u2014a non-time and non-place\u2014where they encounter their unconscious and archetypal memories. Inspired by the event horizon concept, the characters search for a new beginning, questioning whether our world could have emerged from a previous universe, in a moment called \u201cthe bounce,\u201d when space and time dissolved into a cloud of probabilities. \nThrough this journey, they question the nature of time, motion, and instability in a place where there is no fixed perspective. Our vulnerabilities and strengths are mixed as we teeter on the edge, learning more about ourselves. \nCreated by Damiano Ottavio Bigi & Alessandra Paoletti\nPerformers: Damiano Ottavio Bigi, Ching-Ying Chien, Issue Park, Faith Prendergast\nComposition and Sound Design: David Blouin\nMusic: David Blouin, Colin Stetson / Sarah Neufeld Duo, Gary \u2018Oslide, Henry Purcell, Hank Williams\nLighting Design: Lucien Laborderie\nSet and Costumes: In collaboration with Tzela Christopoulou\nSet Construction: Marios Karaolis \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Imagine a world without hunger and malnutrition. What would it take to achieve a genuinely food-secure world\u2014where every person gets to consume the right quantity and quality of food to live a healthy, active, and productive life? \nAchieving and sustaining such a future requires transforming how our food is grown, managed, distributed, and consumed. From production to consumption, our food systems must be more sustainable, halting environmental degradation, and even repairing the damage we have previously done. \nGlenn Denning\u2019s Universal Food Security: How to End Hunger While Protecting the Planet presents a bold, evidence-based, practical guide to food systems transformation. He bridges the divisive worlds of science, policy, and practice. By synthesizing the most relevant literature, consulting the world\u2019s foremost experts, and sharing personal insights gained over four decades, Denning lays out five priority areas for action and investment. \nBut in Universal Food Security, Denning goes beyond what needs to change. He goes on to tackle the challenges of implementation. Echoing the words of his mentor, the late Professor MS Swaminathan, Denning argues that we need the knowhow and the do-how to transform our food systems.\u00a0 \nUniversal Food Security\u00a0calls for a new generation of enlightened practitioner-leaders\u2014acting on their own and with others, through institutions\u2014to achieve a food-secure world. \nImage Captions:\nThumbnail, Poster and Header: Rice crops in Cambodia\nInstastory: Maize crops in Malawi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

In this performance, the story of her life will be told by Kafeel Jafri \u2013 a Dastango (\u2018storyteller\u2019 in Urdu), interspersed with rendition of her songs \u2013 Ghazals & Thumris by Yusra Naqvi, a trained Hindustani Classical Singer. \nSupported by: \n\n \n",

    "description": "This unique Indian Classical performance featuring a double neck guitar, tabla and kanjeera,\u00a0bridges tradition and innovation creating a spellbinding tapestry of rhythm and melody. \nThe double-neck guitar, blending the versatility of modern string instruments with the evocative\u00a0tones of Indian ragas, takes center stage. Its rich, resonant sound captures the nuances of\u00a0classical compositions. Complementing this melodic brilliance is the tabla, whose intricate\u00a0rhythms breathe life into every beat. With its dynamic range and precision, the tabla sets a\u00a0pulsating foundation that elevates the musical experience.\u00a0Adding a distinctive flavor to this trio is the kanjira, a small but powerful frame drum renowned\u00a0for its versatility. Its sharp, expressive tones seamlessly blend with the other instruments,\u00a0enriching the rhythmic dialogue with bursts of spontaneity and virtuosity. \nTogether, Anupam, Amit and Swami embark on a journey through soulful ragas, energetic talas,\u00a0and spellbinding improvisations. This concert promises to captivate both connoisseurs of\u00a0classical music and new listeners, celebrating the timeless beauty of Indian traditions through\u00a0an innovative musical lens. \n",
