    "description": "Scholars of international relations, political thought, and India\u2019s diplomatic history continue to debate the meaning and relevance of non-alignment in India\u2019s foreign policy today. The origins of these debates lie in Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s articulation of non-alignment at the height of the Cold War, a concept both resolute and ambiguous. \nIn this talk, Dr. Swapna Kona Nayudu will draw on her acclaimed book, The Nehru Years: An International History of Indian Non-Alignment, to explore how India shaped and deployed this distinctive strategy between 1947 and 1964. Based on meticulous archival research in multiple languages, her work uncovers India\u2019s diplomatic role in pivotal global events such as the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Hungarian Revolution, and the Congo Crisis. \nTracing the evolution of non-alignment from Nehru\u2019s time to the present, Dr. Nayudu will examine its contested meaning, its influence on India\u2019s position as the only non-aligned founding member of the UN, and its continuing resonance as India navigates a complex multipolar world. \nDr. Nayudu will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalke. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Step into a heartfelt journey across time and tradition. In this special performance, the untouched poetic gems of Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharathiyar are brought to life, exploring the vision and passion behind words he once held close. \nOur story begins with the late Prof. K. V. Krishnan from Varanasi, Bharathiyar\u2019s own nephew, whose lifelong love for his uncle\u2019s work unearthed these hidden verses. Through his research, we glimpse Bharathiyar not only as a poet but as a dreamer, lighting fires of change. \nThe name Bharathi, born of the Sanskrit \u201cAbh\u0101y\u0101m + Ratah\u201d, means \u201cone who delights in fearlessness.\u201d This performance honors him as a beacon of courage, his words as arms of inspiration. \nThis evening offers a warm celebration of dance and verse; a simple yet powerful tribute to our fiery national poet, whose voice still stirs hearts today. \nCredits \nMusic Direction \u2013 Dr. Rajkumar Bharathi\nVocal & Nattuvangam \u2013 Swati Athmanathan\nMridangam, Tabla & Voiceover \u2013 Sri.

Ferdinand Kittel (1832 \u2013 1903) was a missionary from Germany, who spent 50 years of his life between India and Germany on his work as a writer, translator, linguist and lexicographer. This period film takes up the journey of his monumental work in the fields of lexicography and philology. Despite many challenges, he mastered the Kannada language and created a huge dictionary and thesaurus unparalleled in any Indian language. He also taught in schools and produced more than 40 scholarly works. \nThis tri-lingual, non-fiction film is shot in locations where Kittel lived and worked both in southern India and Germany, and its first person narration uses his letters to his children in Germany, and letters and reports to superiors. It includes archival photographs dating back to the early 19th century, folk songs and poems written and translated by Kittel, and Old Kannada literature. The film has been shown in different parts of Switzerland, Germany & India. \nDuring the production of the film, one of the early print typefaces of Kannada, pioneered by Kittel and cast in Europe was digitised by the filmmaker, Prashant Pandit, and an open-source font in the name of Kittel was released for public use. This font was extensively used in the books published during the 1860s. The film also uses this font in the displayed texts. \nImage Credit\nHeader: Erstwhile Basel Mission Printing Press, Mangaluru, a still from the film, The Word and the Teacher.\u00a0Ferdinand Kittel supervised the publication of numerous books at the Press. \nProduction Crew:\nDirector, Writer & Editor \u2013 Prashant Pandit\nCinematography \u2013 Chidanand GL & Florina Steiner\nSound \u2013 Anand V & Mahaveer S \n",

    "description": "There are many different views on what it means to be free. One popular perspective sees freedom as a form of independence: being free means not being held back or restricted by the expectations, obligations, or interference from others. After explaining the basic idea in more detail, the talk discusses Bob Dylan\u2019s work to illustrate the value of this kind of freedom while noting that some other parts of Dylan\u2019s work seem to question this very idea of freedom. To explore the critique of freedom, the talk turns to Robert Musil\u2019s (1880-1942) unfinished novel The Man Without Qualities. One way to understand this celebrated novel is to see it as a partly hilarious, partly deeply tragic and moving description of putting too much emphasis on an ideal of freedom as independence. Drawing on insights from moral philosophy, the talk suggests that a proper understanding of the relation between independence and personal integrity can lead to a better appreciation of freedom as independence. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the lecture. \nThis lecture is a part of Vidyashilp University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Contradictions, comparison and ultimately confluence, Dvaita | Duality\u00a0is a fusion of artistic expression and philosophical inquiry. Through two distinct dance forms, Kuchipudi and Balinese, the dynamic balance of opposing energies is beautifully displayed. \nCentred around \u2018Ardhanareeswara\u2019, the composite form of Shiva-Shakti, the dance visualises the distinct yet complementary nature of the masculine and feminine energies. A layered performance, this piece explores the philosophical questions of how our consciousness (Purusha) interacts with the material world (Prakriti). \nThis evening aspires to resolve the paradox of opposites not through negotiation, but harmonious expression. \nCredits: \nConcept, Creation and Artistic Direction: Gomathi Boorada \nDancers:\nGomathi Boorada\nJesitta Jilju\nNeharika Renjith Nair\nHemali Subramanyam Boorada\nAlphonsa Ashwajit Kamble\nSneha Chandrababu\nGoutham Maheswaran\n\u2060Ni Putu Widiantini\n\u2060Ni Wayan Pia Wahyuni\n\u2060Ni Komang Erna Sriwahyuni\n\u2060Ni Kadek Santi Wiadnyani \nMusic:\nI Wayan Sudirana / Gamelan Yugananda\nD.S.V.

    "description": "In Karnatik music, a composer is referred to as a \u2018vaggeyakara\u2019 \u2013 someone who creates both the text (vak) and the music (geya) for a composition. The kirtana is the most important compositional form in Karnatik music. It is a beautiful balance between the sahitya (text), raga (melody) and tala (rhythm). These kirtanas have sprung from the creative flow of melody and text, thus creating a unified aesthetic identity.\u00a0 \nThree eighteenth-century composers, Thyagaraja (1767-1847), Muthusvami Dikshithar (1775-1835) and Shyama Shastri (1762-1827), were masters and innovators of this compositional form, reverentially referred to as the \u2018Trinity\u2019 of Karnatik music. \nThe oldest among the three, Shyama Shastri, composed fewer compositions than his other two contemporaries, but each one of his compositions stand out as a unique piece. He used complex rhythmic structures which give a special quality to his kirtanas. \nThe prolific composer Thyagaraja viewed ragas with utmost clarity and definition. In his kirtanas, you find defined nuggets of the raga\u2019s phrases in almost every line. \nThe esoteric Muthusvami Dikshithar looked at a composition with a different lens. His kirtanas are one whole melodic movement where the raga flows in an unstructured manner, overflowing from one line to another. The deeper one dwells on his compositions, their beauty unravels. \nAt this concert, Sangeetha Sivakumar will be presenting compositions of the Trinity with a special focus on Muthusvami Dikshithar since we are celebrating his 250th birth anniversary this year. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Called \u201ca sonic love letter to Sindh\u201d by The Hindu, this deeply personal work has been featured on NPR\u2019s Best Jazz Albums and Bandcamp\u2019s Best of Jazz. \nInspired by the life of Balani\u2019s late grandfather, K.S. Balani, a renowned Sindhi writer and painter, the album explores themes of migration, ancestral memory, and identity. Through moving compositions and layered soundscapes, Kadahin Milandaasin becomes both a tribute and a journey home. \nThe evening includes a full vinyl playback of the album, followed by an intimate conversation with Tarun Balani himself. Join us for a rare chance to hear the stories behind the music: of love, loss, and legacy.\u00a0 \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences.

It is more than a group of musicians gathered to perform a piece of music; it is a living metaphor for what society could be \u2014 and perhaps what it must be, if we are to thrive together\u2026\u00a0This metaphor becomes even more powerful in today\u2019s world, where individualism often overshadows community, and noise threatens to replace music.

    "description": "Language: English \nWhen the rules of love are rewritten, what\u2019s left standing? \nDario Fo\u2019s The Open Couple is a bold, sharp, and darkly comic exploration of modern relationships pushed to the edge. What begins as a provocative experiment (a husband proposing an open marriage) quickly spirals into chaos, confrontation, and unexpected revelations. \nSet against the backdrop of shifting gender roles and social expectations, the play peels back the layers of a marriage unravelling. With biting wit and disarming vulnerability, Fo exposes the emotional toll of jealousy, the absurdity of control, and the fragile line between freedom and fear. The couple\u2019s battles are fast, funny, and painfully familiar, as they try to navigate the messy terrain of love, power, and identity. \nThrough its rapid dialogue and theatrical twists, The Open Couple holds up a mirror to our ideas of commitment and connection; asking what we\u2019re really seeking when we ask for more. \nA deeply human comedy that leaves room for both laughter and reckoning. \nCredits:\nWriter : Dario Fo\nDirector : Faraz Khan\nCreative Producer : Ragini Roychowdhury\nActors : Vaishali Bisht & Rohan Joshi\nSound : Charvi Ojha \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Folie \u00e0 Deux \nSome connections run so deep, they blur the line between two minds, two lives, until they begin to move as one. Folie \u00e0 Deux, French for \u201ca shared madness\u201d or \u201cshared state of mind,\u201d captures this rare intimacy. \nThe program features two evocative contemporary dance solos: \u201c3 AM\u201d and \u201cNobody Cares.\u201d Together, these performances invite you into that in-between space where stories overlap, emotions echo, and movement speaks what words often cannot. \nTitle: Nobody Cares \nIn \u201cNobody Cares,\u201d Deepak Kurki confronts identity in a world shaped by contradiction. His piece explores the dissonance of social labels and inherited expectations of an individual born in a Hindu family, raised in a Muslim neighborhood, and educated in a Catholic school. Through raw, physical language, Deepak questions the systems that define us\u2014and the quiet resistance that emerges from within. \nCredits: \nChoreographed & Performed by Deepak Kurki Shivaswamy \nMusic: Abhijeet Tambe \nDuration: 30 minutes \nTitle: 3 AM \nIn \u201c3 AM,\u201d Prashant More takes us into the restless mind of an insomniac. The piece traces the delicate edge between exhaustion and wakefulness\u2014a world where time dissolves, and the mind spirals through memory, anxiety, and longing. It\u2019s a quiet, surreal portrait of sleeplessness, told through a body caught in motion while desperately searching for stillness. \nCredits: \nChoreography and Performance: Prashant More Music: Nikhil Nagaraj \nDuration: 35 minutes \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Mumbai in the seventies and eighties was a city of sharp contrasts: glamour and gang wars, chaos and control. At the heart of it all was Assistant Commissioner of Police (Retd) Madhukar B. Zende, a sharp-minded officer with a knack for catching the city\u2019s most elusive criminals. \nBest known for arresting the infamous serial killer Charles Sobhraj, aka the Serpent, Zende\u2019s career spanned decades of high-stakes policing. His new book, Mumbai\u2019s Most Wanted, is a rich and gritty chronicle of life on the force. \nFrom the mysterious murder of Shanta Devi to the capture of criminal kingpins like Arun Gawli, Karim Lala, Haji Mastan and Babu Reshim, his stories unfold like scenes from a noir thriller (except every word is true). There are riots, manhunts, and moments of doubt as well as unexpected grace. \nThis conversation is a rare look into a city in flux and a man who walked its fault lines, chasing justice in a time of smoke-filled bars, typewriters, and quick decisions. \nFor those who wish to engage further, a Q&A with the supercop himself will follow the discussion. \n",

    "description": "123 minutes | Japanese with English subtitles | Japan | 2023 \nWriter & Director: Wim Wenders\nScriptwriter: Takuma Takasaki\nStarring: Koji Yakusho,\u00a0Tokio Emoto,\u00a0Arisa Nakano,\u00a0Aoi Yamada, and others.\nComposer: Patrick Watson \nThe highly anticipated return to fiction feature filmmaking from Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas, Wings\u00a0of Desire), Perfect Days takes the seasoned writer-director to Tokyo to tell a story celebrating\u00a0the hidden joys and minutiae of Japanese culture. \nIn a deeply moving performance that won the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023, Koji Yakusho\u00a0(Babel, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life\u00a0of modesty and serenity, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo\u2019s\u00a0numerous public toilets with his passion for music, literature and photography. As we join him on\u00a0his structured daily routine, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden\u00a0past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \nChanneling Wenders\u2019 affection for the work of Yasujiro Ozu, and combining a refreshingly\u00a0unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital \u2013 particularly the experience of typically unappreciated service work \u2013 with a soundtrack of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s, this is a\u00a0subtle, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming marvel that champions the meditative beauty\u00a0of the everyday world around us. Nominated for the Best International Film award at the 96th\u00a0Academy Awards. \nWim Wenders, born in 1945, rose to international prominence in the 1970s as a pioneer of New German Cinema and remains a key figure in contemporary film. His multifaceted career spans award-winning feature films, innovative documentaries, photography, and writing. After studying at the University of Television and Film Munich and working as a film critic, he co-founded the Filmverlag der Autoren to support independent German auteur films. His early road movie trilogy explored post-war German identity, leading to international acclaim with The American Friend\u00a0(1977). Wenders has since earned numerous global honors, including the Golden Palm at Cannes for Paris, Texas\u00a0and Oscar nominations for documentaries like Buena Vista Social Club\u00a0and Pina. \nThis is the second film in our collaboration with MUBI. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience! \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

Lankesh\u2019s 1971 play Kranthi Banthu Kranthi, brought into the present by Team Kalavilasi. Though decades have passed, the heart of the struggles still ring true today: inequality, power, and the fight for justice. The timeless thread of revolution makes this adaptation both familiar and fresh. \nKranthi Banthu #Kranthi explores how young people respond when their voices are drowned out, how influencers and media twist stories for gain, and how chaos can spread in a world overloaded with opinions. Through sharp satire and thoughtful humor, the play invites the audience to reflect and question. \nThe characters, each driven by their own sense of what is right and wrong, move through a world shaped by capitalist control, media manipulation, and social unrest. They find themselves caught in nuances of the very system they hoped to change. Their choices reflect our own questions about truth, power, and resistance. \nThis is more than a story of protest. It\u2019s about what happens after the call for change, when ideals meet reality. With heart, wit, and bold honesty, Kranthi Banthu #Kranthi welcomes all to witness a revolution both personal and political. \nCast and Crew | \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c97\u0ca3 \u0cae\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0cc1 \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0c82\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0c95 \u0cac\u0cb3\u0c97: \nVaishnavi | \u0cb5\u0cc8\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cb5\u0cbf\nMadhukar Hirisave | \u0cae\u0ca7\u0cc1\u0c95\u0cb0\u0ccd \u0cb9\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0cb8\u0cbe\u0cb5\u0cc6\nSiddaramu K | \u2060\u0cb8\u0cbf\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0ca6\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cc1 \u0c95\u0cc6\nNamitha Ramu | \u2060\u0ca8\u0cae\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cbe \u0cb0\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cc1\nPallavi Hegde | \u2060\u0caa\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cb5\u0cbf \u0cb9\u0cc6\u0c97\u0ca1\u0cc6\nHarsha Vardhan | \u2060\u0cb9\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb7 \u0cb5\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0ca7\u0ca8\u0ccd\nNarayan Badiger | \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0caf\u0ca3\u0ccd \u0cac\u0ca1\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc7\u0cb0\u0ccd\nNagaraj | \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c9c\u0ccd\nSuhas Srinivas | \u0cb8\u0cc1\u0cb9\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ccd \u0cb6\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cc0\u0ca8\u0cbf\u0cb5\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ccd\nAbhishek Chakrannavar | \u0c85\u0cad\u0cbf\u0cb7\u0cc7\u0c95 \u0c9a\u0c95\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0ca3\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cb5\u0cb0\nAbhinav Iyengar | \u0c85\u0cad\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0cb5\u0ccd \u0c85\u0caf\u0ccd\u0caf\u0c82\u0c97\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ccd \nBackground Music | \u0cb9\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0cc6 \u0cb8\u0c82\u0c97\u0cc0\u0ca4 : Sathya Radhakrishna | \u0cb8\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0caf \u0cb0\u0cbe\u0ca7\u0cbe\u0c95\u0cc3\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0ca3\nLighting Design | \u0cac\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0c95\u0cc1 \u0cb5\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0caf\u0cbe\u0cb8 : Manju Narayan | \u0cae\u0c82\u0c9c\u0cc1 \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0caf\u0ca3 & Surya | \u0cb8\u0cc2\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0caf\nCo-ordinator | \u0cb0\u0c82\u0c97 \u0ca8\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cb9\u0ca3\u0cc6 : Basavaraj Emmiyavar | \u0cac\u0cb8\u0cb5\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c9c \u0c8e\u0cae\u0ccd\u0cae\u0cbf\u0caf\u0cb5\u0cb0 \n\n\nSupported by:\n\n",

    "description": "For centuries, Tibet has remained a land of mystery. Though sacred to millions, Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar were still wrapped in myth as recent as the 1900\u2019s. This session retraces the journey of two travelers, a Swedish explorer and an Indian ascetic, whose visits illuminated the mythical and sacred Kailash-Manasarovar region in Tibet. \nBetween 1907 and 1909, Swedish explorer Sven Hedin mapped the region. He traced the sources of the three great rivers \u2013 the Brahmaputra, Indus, and Sutlej \u2013 and became the first European to walk around Mount Kailash. Three decades later, Indian monk Swami Pranavananda arrived in the region. He offered a fresh view, challenging Hedin\u2019s identification of the rivers\u2019 sources, offering, for the first time, an informed Asian perspective on Tibet\u2019s geography. \nThis visually rich talk brings their stories to life. Rare archival material, contemporary photos, and new research reveal how these journeys shaped our understanding of a sacred landscape. \nThe Q&A after the session offers room for your participation \u2013 whether curious about history, travel, or spirituality. \n",

    "description": "Tiny worlds unfold beneath the trees at BIC! \nIn this playful session children become storytellers, thinkers, and artists. Through a blend of nature and imagination, we\u2019ll wander through questions big and small, noticing the rustle of leaves and the flutter of feelings within. \nThis event invites young minds to slow down and look closer at the world around as well as within. Little hands will shape stories, doodle dreams, and share giggles in a space that celebrates wonder. It\u2019s not about right answers or neat lines; it\u2019s about joyful messes, quiet moments, and everything in between! \nWith leaves as our pages and feelings as our ink, this is a morning of connection and creativity for little explorers aged 5 to 8. \n",
