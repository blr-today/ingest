    "description": "Award-winning Italian pianist Elia Cecino presents a programme that evokes the interactions of thought among composers and the web of similarities and quotations woven into their music. Meet the figures who inspired the works of the great nineteenth-century Romantic composers, Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms.\u00a0 \nElia Cecino will perform Liszt exploring the theme of love in the opera \u201cFaust\u201d by Charles Gounod, with the love duet between Faust and Margherita, and in the passionate verses of the Italian poet Francesco Petrarca. Alongside, in an experimental comparison, Cecino will premier in India the \u201cNew Petrarca Sonnet\u201d (2022) by the contemporary composer Orazio Sciortino.\u00a0 \nCecino will also play Brahms\u2019 Variations Op. 9 paying homage to Clara and Robert Schumann, in a meditative atmosphere of memories and allusions. The grandiose Sonata Op. 1, reminiscent of Beethoven\u2019s style, will close the concert with a sparkle. \n \n\nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "On the surface, an Indian doctor, a\u00a0British poet, an UberEats courier in Pittsburgh, and a Chinese activist in exile have nothing in common. But they are in fact linked by a profound common experience\u2015unexpected encounters with artificial intelligence. In\u00a0her debut book\u00a0Code Dependent, shortlisted for the inaugural Women\u2019s Prize for Non-fiction 2024, Madhumita Murgia shows how automated systems are reshaping our lives all over the world, from technology that marks children as future criminals, to an app that is helping to\u00a0offer medical\u00a0diagnoses to a remote tribal community. \nBy highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley, Madhumita explores the impact of this often-exploitative technology on individuals, communities, and our wider society. \nVidushi Marda, a lawyer and researcher, specialises in examining the socio-legal ramifications of data-driven technologies. Her research centers on technology regulation, asymmetric power dynamics, and fundamental rights. Through her endeavors, she collaborates with governments, corporations, and technical communities to promote social justice. \nTogether, they will discuss and unpack\u00a0how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency, and shatter our illusion of free will. AI has already infiltrated our day-to-day, through language-generating chatbots like ChatGPT and social media. But it\u2019s also affecting us in more insidious ways. It touches everything from our interpersonal relationships, to our kids\u2019 education, work, finances, public services, and even our human rights.\u00a0It is already changing what it means to be human, in ways large and small, and Madhumita and Vidushi reveal what could happen if we fail to reclaim our humanity. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

His persona far surpasses the stereotypes that surround him, and this production by Madrasana aims to highlight that.

Little does she know that there are three other companions Andro (Technology), Wadeva (Boredom) and Imagenie (Imagination) who also live with her. These three love Tara very much and are constantly competing with each other to get her attention. Her Dad loves his gadgets and her Mom tries to keep everyone\u2019s imagination alive. \nIt\u2019s summer break and they are off to visit Nani. The rest of the play is about the crazy adventure they end up having. Their car breaks down near a forest. A con man \u2018Baba Black Sheep Singh\u2019 appears and offers to help. He hypnotizes the parents and starts to loot the car. At first Tara is scared but as things get more complicated, she realizes that she will have to do something. Turns out the three secret companions are more than happy to jump in. They help Tara to come up with an explosive plan to scare the baba and bring him to his knees. \nDirectors\u2019 Note: \nEverything is fine in equal measure,\nFinding a balance is finding treasure,\nNothing is good or bad ifs all your perception,\nBut watch out beware don\u2019t be fooled by deception \nWith everything in moderation,\nWe can be a happy nation,\nTechnology, Imagination,\nAnd even Boredom. \nThe play explores the basic idea and importance of technology, boredom imagination in daily life of a child. In big cities, there is a lack of space for children to be physically activity, most schools don\u2019t even have a playground and parents are busy with their lives leaving them with no time for kids. This has led to children also being stuck in their rooms glued to plastic screens. Whatever happened to reading books, playing those make-believe games or finding inventive ways to pass the time? Apart from reaffirming the need to be imaginative, the play also tries to change our perception towards Boredom which is mostly seen as negative. \nCast & Crew \nAndro: Jeh Alexandar / Sukrit Mahajan\nWadeva: Kiyomi Mehta / Meghna Roy Chaudhary\nImagenie: Shreya Sharma / Twvinkle Kapoor\nTara: Shristi Sharma / Prarthana Kudtarkar\nMamma: Deepa Panchal\nPapa: Ameet Bhuvan / Danesh Gopalkrishnan\nBaba Black Sheep Singh: Kaustav Sinha\nGPS Voice: Dilnaz Irani\nBig G Voice: Maneesh Verma \nDirection: Kalyani Hiwale & Akhshay Gandhi\nScript, Lyrics & Music: Asif Ali Beg\nStory: Kalyani Hiwale & Maneesh Verma\nMusic Producer: Kaizad Gherda\nCostumes: Sonal Kharade\nAssistant Director: Vishal\nLights: Vishal & Niranjan Jadhao\nSets & Props: Kapil Dev & Niranjan Jadhao\nStage Manager: Monika Gupta\nPublicity Design: Maneesh Verma\nExecutive Producer: Anita Gandhi\nAssociate Producer: Shimlli Basu\nCreative Producer: Maneesh Verma \nOur Muses: Aadya Verma & Neev Gandhi \nProduced by Collective Madness in collaboration with Conservatory for Arts & Artists\nSupported by Bhasha Centre and Insider under their co-producing initiative \u2013 Manch \n",

    "description": "Two years of Covid\u00a0witnessed\u00a0the world going digital in a big way. The analogue era\u2019s cultural movements like film societies too underwent major changes. Many used digital platforms to see and discuss films in their quest towards building a better film culture. \nAfter starting as the only forum for savouring world film classics in 1940s Mumbai, today the film society movement is finding itself in the midst of a complete digital makeover after two decades of struggling with digital formats from VHS tapes to OTT. Will these changes help them achieve their original goal of developing a group of film connoisseurs and professionals who will carry on the mantle of meaningful films? To know the future one needs to understand the history and its dynamics in full measure. \nBased on the book Celluloid to Digital: India\u2019s Film Society Movement by V K Cherian, this session will begin with a talk examining the future course of the Indian film society movement which nourished the \u2018New Wave\u2019 in Indian films from 1970 and has been an anchor for all the meaningful films in the country. It will be followed by a discussion with\u00a0Babu Subramanian and a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations, the wealth-worth billions in today\u2019s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change \u2013 the emotional and the rational \u2013 and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change\u2014something prevalent in today\u2019s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away.\u00a0The authors will share their insight\u00a0on how it\u2019s imperative to draw lessons from the past, navigate the present, and prepare for the future. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Clowning as an art form allows one to be their most vulnerable self with the freedom to express all kinds of emotions in a light, joyous way. It is both a therapeutic experience as well as a learning experience. Clowning uses strategies like honesty, simplicity, connection, respect and honour wrapped in humour and joy to help participants find their inner child. \nWhen applied in a healthcare system or any place where people are frustrated, anxious or experiencing shame and hopelessness, it becomes a very effective medium to express all kinds of emotions which are otherwise suppressed. It helps unlock a therapeutic effect not only for the people in such setups but also for the people who go in as clowns. \nThis session will involve lots of games, partner work, imagination, voice and body work. \nNote: Participants are requested to wear loose and comfortable clothing to the workshop as there will be moderately intense physical work. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "A new cinema movement emerged in India in the late 1960s with a proposition for artistic cinema not influenced by any considerations other than creative and aesthetic. The promise of this movement, known variously as \u201cIndian New Wave\u201d, \u201cNew Cinema\u201d or \u201cParallel Cinema\u201d was that conscientious filmmakers will make cinema which will bear the distinct stamp of the creative artist and not that of a studio. In form and aesthetics, the new wave aimed to reject the forms and values of commercial cinema which relied on the stars, the gaudy sets, many irrelevant musical sequences and melodrama. This movement attracted many young artists who went on to become well-known auteurs. Indian new wave\u2019s body of work, spanning close to three decades, charted a new course in cinema aesthetics with its zealous attempts to experiment with the language of cinema. At the same time, the new wave auteurs\u2019 steadfast political commitment resulted in a critical examination of the complexities of India\u2019s socio-political realities. \nIt is important to point out that there was no formal process or a formally run operation for this movement. Although the initial impetus to the movement came from the loans provided by the Film Finance Corporation, the passion to make artistic cinema, fuelled by the newly trained filmmakers from the Film and Television Institute of India, spread to different parts of the country. \nIn the Kannada language, serendipitously, the first artistic attempt to break free from reigning commercial filmmaking practices came in 1970 when Pattabhirama Reddy produced and directed Samskara\u00a0\u2013 at approximately the same time when the Film Finance Corporation was funding what are considered as the first three films of the Indian new wave: Uski Roti, Ankur\u00a0and Sara Aakash. Samskara\u2019s success was followed by a few other experiments by filmmakers such as Girish Karnad, N Lakshminarayan and BV Karanth. \nBut the one auteur who went on to make some of the most influential and groundbreaking films and put Kannada cinema on the world map was Girish Kasaravalli. \nGirish Kasaravalli graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India in 1975, and his first film as a Director was Ghatashraddha (1977). In the last 47 years since, Girish\u2019s body of work \u2013 17 feature films and one television series \u2013 has critically engaged with the social, political, ideological, philosophical and environmental concerns of the Kannada society and, in a larger sense, of India. Kasaravalli\u2019s films have won him four Golden Lotuses (National Award for best feature film from the Government of India), a Padma Shri and many other awards and recognitions in film festivals across the world. \nToday, when we have access to a variety of content at our fingertips, it is essential to engage with the work of Girish Kasaravalli and learn his remarkable mastery of the formal, aesthetic and thematic aspects of filmmaking and understand his contributions to film art. \nIn this retrospective of Girish Kasaravalli, we screen six of his films and also have conversations with him and other collaborators after each screening. \nB-Cinematic \nCalling all cinephiles! BIC is thrilled to introduce B-Cinematic, an initiative dedicated to celebrating the most essential, impactful, and artistically significant cinematic works from across the state and the country. \nAt B-Cinematic, our mission is to curate and share those remarkable films that is a must-watch (or re-watch) experience for every passionate cinema lover. From groundbreaking classics to under-appreciated gems, our carefully curated selection will take you on an unparalleled (pun not intended) cinematic journey through the ages. \nThrough curated screenings, insightful discussions, and engaging analyses from distinguished cinematic voices, we aim to not only watch these films together but to truly appreciate their craftsmanship, cultural impact, and intellectual depth. Our vibrant community of film aficionados will collectively rediscover Indian cinema\u2019s most stunning and enduring masterpieces. \nSo join us on this quest to experience the films that have defined and redefined the art form. Don\u2019t miss out on crossing these essential works off your bucket list. Because to truly live, you must first watch the films that make life worth living. \n",

The Courtesan Project\u00a0has become one of the most successful dance revival movements in today\u2019s time.

The performance is set as an intimate mehfil performance of how the Tawaifs would perform in yesteryears. Their music, their stories, their dance enacted by a single performer. \nThis is a bold statement that is needed to finally accord respect for the performance art of the Tawaif, to go beyond the drawing room sniggers and laughter associated with the word Tawaif, and to finally acknowledge their role in history. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Kaafi is a dance theatre production that explores the multifaceted nature of blindness, both physical and metaphorical, through the lens of the character Gandhari from the Indian epic, Mahabharata. The performance uses the form of Bharathanatyam to delve into themes of ideals and examples, conformity, oppression, the roles assigned to a woman, and the consequences of our choices. Kaafi\u00a0contextualises evocative political poetry to narrate the story in the nostalgic memory of Gandhari, her absurd choices, and examines the unseen forces that dictated it. The performance imagines and weaves an intimate tale of her reasons and feelings. A haunting voice that cursed her to perpetual darkness; shackled by the multiple roles of a daughter, wife, mother, and queen, that competed and tore her apart; her relationship with her only kin; her participation and perpetrating of the oppression and violence and an obscured vision of what her life could have been. \nKaafi becomes a mirror reflecting the universal struggle of every woman across time and space. It explores the perpetual tension between aspiration and reality that is predestined for every woman; aspiring to be ideal but perennially falling short\u2014forever insufficient, yet infinitely compelling. Through a combination of dance, symbolism, and internal monologues, the performance invites the audience to reflect on how we navigate the intricacies of our existence, condition of our life and the act of seeing, constantly tugging at the personal question and political state of affairs. \nArtists and Collaborators\u00a0 \n\nEnsemble of 6 performers- Adithi, Karuna, Smitha, Keerthana, Krutika, Talin\nChoreography-\u00a0Priyanka Chandrasekhar\nLanguage \u2013 Urdu and Hindi\u00a0\nStyle of dance \u2013 Bharathanatyam\u00a0\nMusic production \u2013 Dheeraj Baneerjee\u00a0\nAssistance in composition \u2013 Karuna Kirtivasan and Arvind Sridhar\u00a0\nVocals and voice\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Deepthi Baskar\nVocal and voice support \u2013 Karuna Kirtivasan and Talin Subbaraya\nLights \u2013\u00a0Arvind Sridhar\nText \u2013\u00a0Poetry by\u00a0Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Akhtar Sheerani,\u00a0Excerpts from Kartika Nair\u2019s \u2013\u00a0Until\u00a0the Lions\nCreatives, photos and film \u2013 Arvind Sridhar\u00a0\n\n",

Soon after, farmers from across the country gathered at the borders of India\u2019s national capital, New Delhi, for one of the biggest non-violent protests in modern history.\u00a0 \nExpressing their concerns about the dangers of corporatisation of agriculture, farmers articulated detailed and nuanced criticism against what they believed were unjust laws. Over the year-long protest, the farmers slept and cooked on the national highway, braving extreme weather conditions and hostility from their government, until the laws were repealed. \nAlong with the strong mobilisation by the farmer unions, it was the embodiment of Sikh principle of sewa\u00a0(selfless service for the betterment of society) and the expression chardi kala\u00a0(eternal optimism) that made the movement dynamic, unique and strengthened its undying and indomitable spirit. \nInspired by their everyday resilience, Chardi Kala follows the journey of the farmers\u2019 protest until their victory.

Her first gramophone recording, Ayyo Koyyoda at age 8, ignited her lifelong love affair with folk music. She was a trailblazer who introduced folk songs on a concert platform when she was 11.

She was multi-talented and excelled in music of every genre but folk music remained her passion. She dedicated her life to popularising and propagating traditional and folk songs. She bequeathed an invaluable legacy to posterity by categorising her vast collection into 7 volumes and publishing them along with lyrics and music notations.
