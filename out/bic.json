    "description": "The UN Sustainable Development Goals frame until 2030 globally consented objectives to ensure the balance between socio-economic interests and ecological requirements. Already now, we know that many of the goals will not be realized since some of them are contradictory to others and since efforts to realize them fail due to non-knowledge-based policies and geopolitical conflicts. There is no way back to national or regional perspectives on the future, as these will also increasingly depend on global cooperation and consensus-building. Consequently, since only five years are left to define the new UN goals, an in-depth discourse on these future goals should start right now. \nThis public lecture intends to synthesize experiences from implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals using some case studies in the Global South, and to think of potential new goals and their implementation \u2013 as well as to think of what could be improved to enhance the uptake of scientific results in policy processes, to enhance science-policy-interactions. \nThis session is part of the Let\u2019s Talk Climate Change Talk series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

With very different origins and subsequent trajectory of development, the solo pieces will showcase traditional repertoire, while the Bharatanatyam-Kathak duet will simultaneously showcase the unique characteristics of both styles. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another.\u00a0 \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "\nEverything that we chase in life has ended up as a\u00a0Mirage, an elusive state of mind which\u00a0can\u00a0never be arrived at. The more we go closer to it the farther it moves. The thin line between reality and illusion blurs our vision, yet we chase this enigmatic and seductive phenomena called life. Deluded with its charismatic nature, we are pulled towards the uncharted path. We walk this path of delusion like a musk deer, who is intoxicated with its own fragrance .It gradually binds us in attachments and emotions which leaves us blinded .We are trapped by her, whose name is \u201cMaya\u201d. \n\nMirage\u00a0\u2013 A lust for life, was initially\u00a0created as a short dance film in 2021 which was screened in a few dance festivals including Inmotion Dance Film Festival, Chicago .Taking the seed from there, the work was reimagined for the proscenium\u00a0stage.\n\nThe performance would be followed by the film screening. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n\n\nDancers & Credits\nSangita Chatterjee ( Artistic Director)\nKavita Das\nLisa Saha\nNabiha Yusuf\nSamadrita Chandra\nPraveen Prasad\nManpreet\n\nMusic \u2013 Anirban Bhattacharya\nCostumes \u2013 Sandhya Raman\nLight Design \u2013 Milind Srivastava\nLight execution \u2013 Faruk Ahmed\n\nConcept, script & choreography \u2013 Sangita Chatterjee. \n\n\nSupported by:\n\n",

    "description": "When\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi\u00a0Arundale founded Kalakshetra in 1936, she did not intend to create a new style of Bharatnatyam. Yet, the Kalakshetra bani emerged\u2014a new approach that distinguished itself from the traditional \u2018sadir\u2019 style.\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi\u2019s choreography blended classical purity with innovative storytelling, giving rise to a new school of Bharatanatyam that balanced tradition with modern sensibilities. \nOver two decades ago, Kalakshetra alumna Swagata Sen Pillai began curating Smriti Pravah in memory of\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi, celebrating her legacy on her birth anniversary and bringing together Kalakshetra students worldwide to honor their guru. After Swagata\u2019s untimely passing due to COVID, her friends and seniors from Kalakshetra, Tripti Bhupen and Archita Mehta, have continued this tradition. \nIn 2025, on\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi\u2019s 121st anniversary, Archita Mehta\u2019s NrityaSadhana Centre for Bharatanatyam and Indian Folk Dances, and Tripti Bhupen\u2019s Samarpan School of Performing Arts take a journey into her creative world, where she preserved Bharatanatyam\u2019s traditions while innovating within its structure. \nThe performance will be in two parts: the first will highlight pieces from the margam choreographed by\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi\u2019s direct disciples, while the second will explore her timeless dance dramas. \nPerformers \nArchita Mehta\nTripti Bhupen\nGayatri Krishnaveni Lakshmanan\nVasundhara Thomas\nPriyashri Rao\nLasya Priya R\nNrithika B Natesh. \nPresented by: \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Gandhari, Kunti and Draupadi are the three women intricately woven into the tapestry that is the Mahabharata. They weave in and out of all the major events leading to the war at Kurukshetra. Who are these women? What part do they play in the oncoming war? What dilemmas do they confront, and how does it shape their lives? \nIndian-Scottish storyteller\u00a0Gauri\u00a0Raje\u00a0and Scottish musician Mairi Campbell tell the stories of these three women in the Mahabharata, the world\u2019s longest epic.

    "description": "On September 17, 1949, C.N. Annadurai (Anna) founded the DMK after splitting with Periyar E.V. Ramaswamy. The party steadily gained mass appeal, shedding its separatist stance in 1962 and winning power in Tamil Nadu in 1967. Since then, it has remained a major force, first under M. Karunanidhi and now under M.K. Stalin. \nDespite political upheavals\u2014including M.G. Ramachandran\u2019s 1972 split, its 1976 ousting during the Emergency, dismissal in 1991 over alleged LTTE ties, and a 1993 split\u2014the DMK has endured, reclaiming power in 2021. \nKnown for its pioneering welfare policies, the DMK now promotes its \u2018Dravidian Model\u2019 as a national alternative, emphasizing Tamil cultural nationalism and cooperative federalism. Yet, 75 years on, it faces challenges from caste-based and nationalist forces, as well as accusations of corruption and dynastic rule. \nAt this crucial juncture, veteran political commentator R. Kannan examines the DMK\u2019s journey and future, offering an objective and comprehensive account of its role in Tamil Nadu politics. \nAuthor R. Kannan will be in conversation with Author & Editor Karthik Venkatesh. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Mai Ri\u00a0beautifully captures the legacy and struggles of two extraordinary women in Indian classical music: Padmabhushan Gaanatapaswini Mogubai Kurdikar and her daughter, Padmavibhushan Gaanasaraswati Kishori Amonkar. Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar, an eminent vocalist of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana, navigated a time when women in music faced societal and institutional barriers. Through sheer dedication and artistic brilliance, she not only earned her place as one of the most revered figures in classical music but also ensured that her daughter and disciple, Kishori Amonkar, became one of the most influential vocalists of her era. \nConceptualized by noted vocalist Radhika Joshi, who carries forward this lineage as a disciple of Pt. Raghunandan Panshikar (a senior disciple of Kishori Amonkar and student of Mogubai Kurdikar), Mai Ri\u00a0is a thematic presentation that brings alive their musical and personal journeys. Through a carefully curated selection of bandishes composed by Mai (Mogubai Ji) and Kishoritai, Radhika interweaves music with storytelling, sharing anecdotes from their lives that offer a rare glimpse into their artistic and emotional worlds. \nRadhika Joshi will be accompanied by Sumith Naik on Tabla and Surya Upadhyay on Harmonium, enriching the performance with their artistry. \nThis event is part of\u00a0Unheard Narratives, BIC\u2019s programmes to commemorate Women\u2019s Day 2025.

    "description": "At moments when \u2018the world turns upside down\u2019, the lives and actions of ordinary people are illumined in a flash, to reveal the history of those who may have otherwise left few archival traces. \nThis Masterclass comprising four sessions, focuses on four emblematic figures of 19th and 20th century Princely Mysore: the insurgent peasant, the reformed Devadasi, the defiant miner of Kolar Gold Field, and the nationalist rebel.\u00a0Whether their actions were successful or ended in failure, the unparalleled richness of the legal records, police accounts, or the administrative enquiry, in their \u2018incitement to speech\u2019, gave voice to those who involuntarily collided with the law. \nHow did these \u2018peoples without history\u2019 question the structures of which they were a part, and shape the course of Mysore\u2019s past? What were their modes of communication, and what forms did their resistance take? These Masterclasses explore such \u2018histories from below\u2019 as they rewrite the better-known narratives of progressive, Modern Mysore. \nMar 11 | The Insurgent Peasant of 1830-31 | 6:30pm \nIn 1830, the peasants of the Nagara Division rose unexpectedly in revolt against the Mysore administration of Krishna Raja Wodeyar III. The insurgency quickly spread to other districts, even reaching Bangalore, and extended to British India as well, continuing until 1837. Before it was finally \u2018tranquillised\u2019 by forces of the East India Company, which came to the aid of the Rajah, the Nagara insurrection revealed as much about the hostility and anger of the peasants against their local oppressors, as of their hopes and dreams for another future. In some ways, the Nagara insurrection was an important precursor to the rebellion of 1857. \nMar 12 | The Abolition of the Devadasi and her Dance | 6:30pm \nIn the late 19th century, there was growing public embarrassment in Mysore about the patronage by temples and the Mysore court of the Devadasi and her dance. Mysore became one of the earliest regions of southern India to break this link, and abolish such patronage through administrative fiat. In an age when women (and children) were increasingly becoming the objects of reform, what consequences did this have on the cultural and social life of Mysore? How did it reset dance and music practice thereafter? The determined assault on the Devadasi and her dance, accompanied by the reform focus on child-wife also signaled emerging definitions of licit and illicit gender and sexual relations. \nMar 13 | The Defiant Worker of Kolar Gold Field, 1930 | 6:30pm \nIn April 1930, more than 18,000 miners at Kolar Gold Field began deserting their workplace, to journey back to their native villages. What prompted this mass action, among many who had spent two generations working in the mines?\u00a0 The strike, moreover, appeared to have no identifiable leaders, making it difficult for both the state and the Company officials to bring it to an end. Despite this, workers forged a remarkable solidarity, gained a reversal of the decisions which threatened their dignity and self-worth, while drawing attention to the bleak conditions of life and labour in one of Mysore\u2019s most prestigious enterprises. \nMar 14 | The Nationalist Rebels of Isoor, 1942 | 6:30pm \nIn response to M.K.Gandhi\u2019s \u2018Quit India\u2019 call of August 1942, the little village of Isoor, in Shikaripur Taluk, declared \u2018Independence\u2019 and set up an alternative administration in September.\u00a0 Leadership of this nationalist protest was provided by the leading landlords and sahukars of the village, who appointed two child surrogates as \u2018Amaldar\u2019 and \u2018Sub Inspector\u2019. The Gandhian call for non-violent protest was quickly transformed into its opposite, leading to the mob lynching of two officials of the Mysore State.\u00a0 Whether this was considered a crime or a political act depended on who would remember and judge those fateful three days, which ended in death by hanging of five peasant rebels, and imprisonment of several others. \n",

    "description": "The Sarod, a relatively new introduction in the world of Hindustani classical music has established itself as one of the foremost instruments in this niche artform garnering love from all corners of the world. Originating from the Afghan Rebab, and demonstrated proficiently and intellectually by the masters of the senia Gwalior and Shahjahanpur gharanas, the Sarod was later received with open arms by the Maihar Gharana in the late 1800s, headed by Ustad Alauddin Khan, and popularised by his son Ustad Ali Akbar Khan as well as Pandit Ravi Shankar. \nThis morning concert features Abhishek Borkar, a pupil of the Sarod with roots in Maihar Gharana, through his father Pt. Shekhar Borkar, himself a disciple of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. The performance will dive deep into the music of Maihar, as well as present intricate techniques of the Senia and Shahjahanpur gharanas, beautifully melding into a wholesome and rounded Sarod concert which will present tradition and modernity with just the right balance. \nYou will experience through this session, the impact and perception of an ancient tradition through a young lens, as well as the role global music plays in our everyday lives. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "The idea is simple yet powerful: if audiences find it increasingly difficult to come to the theatre, why not take theatre to them? This initiative transforms some of the most successful plays\u2014entertaining and time-tested\u2014into a Storytelling Theatre format. With just two actors (sometimes even one), these plays are stripped of elaborate sets, costumes, and lighting, focusing purely on engaging storytelling and strong performances. \nSo far, ten plays have been adapted into this two-actor format. These include: \n1.\u00a0Robi\u2019s Garden \u2013 A collection of Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s most entertaining and unexpectedly humorous stories.\n2.\u00a0Salaam Moli\u00e8re \u2013 A tribute to the French playwright\u2019s sharp wit and satire.\n3.\u00a0Tales of Tenali Rama \u2013 Clever and comedic folklore from South India.\n4.\u00a0A Collection of Indian Folk Tales \u2013 Stories passed down through generations.\n5.\u00a0Laughing at Death \u2013 A unique collection of stories that find humor in mortality. \nAnd many more are in the pipeline! \nThis format makes theatre more accessible and brings compelling storytelling to wider audiences, outside conventional performance spaces. Expanding on this idea, we have a day long engagement with storytellers, actors and theatre lovers alike! \nPart One: The Monologue Circle | 11 AM \u2013 1:15 PM\nCoordinated by S.

    "description": "For over five decades since the Liberation of Bangladesh and the 1971 India-Pakistan War, the Indian state has had to pay a heavy price to protect the fabric of its democracy and its basic geographical structure in the face of a multiplicity of national security threats. These threats have ranged from constant pressure along its Northern and Western borders from nuclear-armed adversaries, several internal fissures and cracks in Punjab, J&K and the Northeast and a festering problem of Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) across several states. Complementing these internal and border security challenges have been challenges in the neighborhood that have precipitated the deployments of India\u2019s military such as in Sri Lanka and Maldives in the late 1980s. \nAir Vice Marshal Arjun Subramaniam, former fighter pilot and accomplished military historian, explores war and conflict in contemporary India in his latest book, Shooting Straight: A Military Biography of Lt Gen Rostum K. Nanavatty. Moving beyond the traditional discourse of the 1965 and 1971 wars, the book examines modern military challenges through the lens of one of India\u2019s most distinguished post-1971 Army commanders. From leading para commandos in Sri Lanka to commanding formations in Siachen, Baramulla, and the Northeast during key crises, and later serving as Northern Army Commander in the aftermath of the 2001 Parliament attack, Nanavatty gained a frontline perspective on hybrid and \u2018grey zone\u2019 warfare\u2014topics highly relevant today. \nJoining AVM Subramaniam in a free-wheeling discussion on the changing character of conflict over the past few decades and its implications for India through the lens of Gen Nanavatty is military historian Probal Dasgupta. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",
