    "description": "Born in Mali and raised in France, Aboubakar Fofana is a multidisciplinary artist and designer whose practice spans calligraphy, textiles, and natural dyes. Renowned for reinvigorating and redefining traditional West African indigo dyeing techniques, Fofana\u2019s work is rooted in a deep spiritual belief that nature is divine \u2014 that by honoring this divinity, we begin to comprehend the vast and sacred interconnectedness of the universe. \nIn this conversation, Fofana will reflect on indigo and others as material and metaphor \u2014 a living medium through which memory, ecology, and spirituality converge. His process engages with the natural cycles of growth and decay, birth and transformation, positioning indigo not simply as pigment but as an agent of renewal. For Fofana, the act of making becomes a form of meditation, where touch, rhythm, and the alchemy of fermentation reveal a profound dialogue between human intention and the natural world. \nThe talk will also offer insight into his current work in Siby, Mali, where he is creating a community-based farm that places indigenous West African indigo at the heart of a holistic permaculture system of local food, medicine, and dye plants. This ambitious project embodies his commitment to cultural preservation, environmental stewardship, and the rebirth of fermented indigo dyeing in contemporary practice. \nMaterial, Memory, and the Sacred invites audiences to experience indigo as a spiritual practice, a bridge between craft and cosmology, where colour, earth, and devotion become inseparable. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Tat-Tvam Asi is a meditative dance production that explores the essence of surrender as a path to self-realisation, through the lives of Andal, Radha, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu\u2014each a yogi in their own right. Drawing from the Bhagavad Gita, where Krishna says, \u201cAs all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly, \u201d this work reflects the multiple ways one can find the divine: through devotion, knowledge, or selfless action. The production unfolds as a series of \u00a0vignettes\u2014Andal\u2019s karmic service, Radha\u2019s longing rooted in bhakti, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu\u2019s ecstatic sankeertana\u2014interwoven with Krishna \u2019s own voice as the sutradhar (narrator). From the chariot of Jagannatha in Puri to the quiet sanctum of a temple, the narrative reveals the beauty of total surrender, dissolving the ego in divine love. Blending classical dance traditions such as Bharatnatyam and Gaudiya Nritya with original music and poetic texts, Tat-Tvam Asi is a journey into Krishna Tattvam\u2014the omnipresence of the divine within and around us. \nThe depth of this timeless message and wisdom (familiar to many Vedantic scholars and Indians) was explored by Neha through the many coloured hues of devotion (bhakti) found in ancient lores and cultures. Neha chose the beloved pastoral God Krishna as the focus of bhakti of the devotee. Neha\u2019s approach to Tat Tvam Asi is episodic. Fragments from Andal, Radha and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were revisited and evoked with compelling conviction through her intense abhinaya. Neha Mondal has conceptualized Tat-Tvam Asi after years of deep reflection on the nature of devotion and surrender. Her creative process involved studying scriptures, poetry, and the lives of Andal, Radha, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to understand their spiritual journeys. She collaborated closely with scholars, musicians, and writers to shape a narrative that is both intimate and universal. As a dancer rooted in tradition yet open to exploration, Neha wove together movement, music, and storytelling to evoke the transformative power of bhakti. This production is a culmination of her artistic introspection and spiritual inquiry, brought to life through dance. \nCredits \nConcept & Choreography: Neha Mondal \nScript: Smt.

Sung during auspicious occasions such as marriage, childbirth, and festivals, these songs celebrate womanhood in all its beauty and grace, blending melody, poetry, and emotion into a timeless cultural expression. \nIn this edition of\u00a0BIC Janapada, audiences will experience\u00a0Shobane P\u0101\u1e0da\u00a0through two distinct regional lenses, from the soulful verses of\u00a0Pattalamma Janapada Kala Sangha, led by Krishne Gowda from Mandya in Southern Karnataka, to the earthy, resonant tunes of\u00a0GK Kala Vedika\u00a0from North Karnataka. Together, they offer a rare glimpse into how different communities express shared emotions through diverse musical idioms and dialects. \nThrough live renditions and storytelling, the session explores the social and cultural significance of\u00a0Shobane, how these songs serve as a collective blessing, a space for women to voice joy, longing, and devotion. The audience will be invited to experience the changing rhythms and tones that mark life\u2019s transitions, from the playful to the profound. \nMore than just performance, this is a celebration of continuity ,of how music has always been a vessel for community, emotion, and identity in Karnataka\u2019s living traditions. \nThis is the fifth performance of our series\u00a0BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka\u2019s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression.\u00a0Through demonstrations, performances, and academic discussions, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",
