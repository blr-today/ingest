    "description": "Thanuja: A Memoir of Migration and Transition is the first memoir by a Sri Lankan Tamil transwoman who is now a German citizen. The recently published English translation has been gaining attention across social media for its powerful account of gender, displacement, and resilience across continents. \nThis session reflects on the layered process of translating Thanuja Singam\u2019s life story, not only across languages but also across histories, geographies, and identity formations. In placing the memoir in dialogue with the expanding field of Indian trans literature, the discussion opens up questions around how language shapes identity, how trans voices find space on the page, and how literary traditions both support and constrain such narratives. \nThe conversation will engage with the evolving landscape of trans writing in South Asia, examining the literary, political, and affective threads that connect diverse trans experiences. It also considers how translation can serve as a bridge between communities, turning individual testimony into collective memory. \n",

    "description": "When the powers that be in Delhi think of Farooq Abdullah, they think of former R&AW chief A.S. Dulat, too. The Abdullah\u2013Dulat connection \u2013 unlikely, even dangerous \u2013 has shaped Kashmir\u2019s history in ways that few understand. One was India\u2019s top intelligence officer, the other its most defiant Kashmiri leader. They should have been enemies. Instead, they built a quiet, complicated alliance that has outlasted governments, betrayals and shadow wars. \nFrom the explosion of militancy in the 1990s to the hijacking of Air India\u2019s IC-814 in 1999 and the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, their story is inseparable from Kashmir\u2019s most turbulent moments. In this book, for the first time, Dulat turns to the man behind the legend. What is Farooq like when the cameras are off? How did 370 alter his place in Kashmir\u2019s future? What divides him from his son and heir, Omar? And as Kashmir remains contentious, what cards does he still have to play? \nThe Chief Minister and the Spy\u00a0is a collection of secrets, encounters and untold stories \u2013 some whispered, some explosive. With wit, candour and an insider\u2019s eye, Dulat reveals \u2018Doctor Sahib\u2019 (as Farooq is popularly known) as only he can. Compelling and deeply human, this book offers a rare glimpse into an unlikely relationship forged in the heat of one of India\u2019s most complex conflicts. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, A S Dulat will be in conversation with Karthik Venkatesh. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in April 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Overcast, Audible, and Amazon Music. \n",

In today\u2019s India, the question is no longer theoretical, but urgent and deeply personal for over 200 million people. \nThis session explores the shifting political landscape of Indian Muslims through the lens of Shikwa-e-Hind, the new book by political scientist Mujibur Rehman. He examines what he calls their \u201cthird political moment,\u201d a phase marked by the erosion of constitutional equality and the rise of a majoritarian ethos since 2014. Tracing the arc from the aftermath of 1857, through the hopeful vision of 1947, to today\u2019s polarised climate, Rehman invites a critical look at the future of democratic participation for Indian Muslims. \nThe conversation features Mujibur Rehman in dialogue with author and columnist Aakar Patel and moderated by journalist Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed. They will explore the tension between constitutional ideals and majoritarian pressures, the structural challenges of representation, and the possibilities for reclaiming dignity, rights, and democratic participation for Indian Muslims. The session will conclude with a Q&A, offering space for your questions in what promises to be an inclusive and engaging discussion. \n",
