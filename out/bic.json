    "description": "This event is a 3-hour seminar on intellectual property in India, hosted by Professor Lawrence Liang and\u00a0Carl\u00a0Malamud\u00a0of the Servants of Knowledge Initiative. \nThis seminar is aimed at people who spend time on Access to Knowledge, Free and Open Software, and other civic technologies. \nOpen source software, and Creative Commons licensing emerged as an important challenge to the dominant narrative of copyright law. The framework of open knowledge has played a pivotal role in democratizing information, fostering collaboration, and empowering creators and users alike. However, in the last two decades, we have also witnessed their limitations, especially when it comes to addressing the question of infrastructure. Physical libraries are a good example of how the limitations of physical goods and severely constrained infrastructures still serve as a impediment to access to knowledge. \nIn the domain of library infrastructure, one particularly noteworthy innovation is the digitization of books, a process that transforms physical texts into accessible digital assets. Book scanning, as a cornerstone of digital library infrastructure, offers a compelling case study in navigating the intricate landscape of copyright exceptions and controlled lending. At its core, book scanning epitomizes the transformative power of technology in democratizing access to knowledge. By digitizing print collections, libraries can transcend physical constraints, reaching those who traditionally do not have access and ensuring the preservation of knowledge for future generations. However, the process of digitization raises complex legal considerations, particularly in relation to copyright law. \nIn many jurisdictions, copyright exceptions and limitations provide a legal framework for libraries to digitize and make available certain works without seeking explicit permission from rights holders. These exceptions often encompass activities such as preservation, research, and access for individuals with print disabilities. However, the scope and applicability of these exceptions vary widely across jurisdictions, posing challenges for libraries seeking to navigate a patchwork of legal regimes. \nIn this workshop, we focus on copyright law in India and contend that the design of exceptions and limitations in India are particularly facilitative of access. Using case studies such as the Delhi University photocopy case, the Sci-Hub case and the Hatchette case on Controlled digital lending, we will probe questions of how copyright in India can be used to facilitate the creation of infrastructures of knowledge. Using our experience at servants of knowledge, of scanning large libraries, we propose a framework that brings together open source activists, book collectors, librarians, students, researchers and authors under a common platform \u201cPublic library of India\u201d, designed to imagine digital infrastructure for 21st century India. \nFor further reading: \n\nLiang and\u00a0Malamud, Controlled Lending by Public Libraries Under Indian Law,\u00a0https://archive.org/details/Controlled.Lending.India/Controlled.Lending.20230505.pamphlet/\nMalamud, Gyan Satyagraha, Remarks Delivered at Kannada University,\u00a0https://archive.org/details/kannada.university.20240415/02-kannada.university.20240415/\nLiang and Gupta, The Public Library Movement in India,\u00a0https://archive.org/details/public.library.movement.india\n\nPresented by: \n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "This discussion is set in the context of the recent ruling from the Karnataka High Court that limits public protests in Bangalore to a designated space within one park in the city, that too subject to police approval. It aims to explore how art can serve as an alternative medium for voicing dissent and fueling public discourse. \nThe panel will discuss the ramifications of the Court\u2019s ruling and its impact on communities, and talk about art as a potent tool for social change. Through their experiences, the panelists will demonstrate how art can amplify voices, provoke thought, and catalyze change even amidst growing restrictions on dissent. \n",

But like all the great works, this play has a possibility. of presentation beyond space and time. This production is such an attempt to transpose beyond all the boundaries. The \u2018song\u2019 of the valley crosses the valley, the life inside the valley continues its song. the play unveils this conflict. \nThe play showcases and tries balance the lives of the aborigines who are alienated and enslaved in their own land, the miracles of the land where small seeds grow into big fruit, and the cities that sow the dream of liberation despite the many dangers. The play makes us not to see life in black and white, but to see it through logical and rational vision. Here, the playwright insists that the character of playwright and of Grandpa Bucks should be played by the same actor, thereby directing us not to emotionally lean to any one side of the conflict. \nThis is how the song of the valley resounds; not only in our hearts, but also in our minds:\nI am incredibly hurt and angry about South Africa\u2019s history and present. But love is the only energy I\u2019ve ever used as a writer. I\u2019ve never written out of anger, although anger has informed love. \u2013 Athol Fugard. \nCast and Crew:\nPlaywright: Athol Fugard\nTranslation: Dr. Meera Moorthy\nMusic: Anush Shetty and Munna Mysore\nMusic accompany: Chethan Singanallur\nLighting: Vinay Ganesh, Mysore\nPainting: H.

Through a choreographic lens, it looks at objects that speak to a cultural and colonial heritage, embodying critical questions of our attachment to \u2018belongings\u2019, to the idea of \u2018belonging\u2019 and to place. \nThe installation presents a personal collection of thirteen objects inherited, owned, acquired or lost to bring out a history of their transactions beyond ownership, origin and identity. How can the act of looking, touching or holding these objects be a way to \u2018read\u2019 them? The objects are displayed as photographic images. Scan the QR codes on each image to listen to an account of their journeys. These writings, in turn, find their way into the body in a dance film that accompanies the images. Interrupting this assembly of image, sound and film is periodical live movement that punctuates the tableau. \nPerformance:\u00a0\u2018how are things \u2026?\u2019\nSaturday, 15 June | 7:00 pm\n \n\u2018how are things \u2026?\u2019 is a 50 minute solo performance within the context of the performance installation INHERITAGE by choreographer Preethi Athreya. Through a development of text, movement and sound, Preethi presents a personal \u2018archaeology\u2019 of objects inherited, passed on or lost. By tracing the journey of things into our lives, she asks\u00a0 \u2013 can we make an anatomical, speculative fiction of objects? Can we trace \u2018her-stories\u2019 (and not totalising and reductive \u2018his\u2019tories) of objects found not in the museum, but in our family homes, that have written us into being \u2026?  \nINHERITAGE was produced by the CHARCOAL platform for collaboration with support from Prakriti Foundation and the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise of Madras. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "The Great Flap of 1942\u00a0is a narrative history of a neglected and scarcely known period\u2014between December 1941 and mid-1942\u2014when all of India was caught in a state of panic. This was largely a result of the British administration\u2019s mistaken belief that Japan was on the verge of launching a full-fledged invasion. It was a time when the Raj became unduly alarmed, when the tongue of rumour wagged wildly about Japanese prowess and British weakness and when there was a huge and largely unmapped exodus (of Indians and Europeans) from both sides of the coastline to \u2018safer\u2019 inland regions. This book demonstrates, quite astonishingly, that the Raj cynically encouraged the exodus and contributed to the repeated cycles of rumour, panic and flight. It also reveals how the shadow of the Japanese threat influenced the course of nationalist politics, altered British attitudes towards India and charted the course towards Independence. \nThe title \u2018The Great Flap of 1942\u2019 refers to an expression used by British bureaucrats in India that traces a broad narrative arc, starting with the Japanese attacks in South-East Asia. The assault on Malaya, the conquest of Singapore, the bombing and eventual occupation of Burma, and the Japanese Navy\u2019s foray into the Indian Ocean are examined in the light of the tremendous impact they had on India. \nThe author of the book, Mukund Padmanabhan, will be in conversation with Historian & Columnist, V Sriram. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Wild Women: Seekers, Protagonists and Goddesses in Sacred Indian Poetry\u00a0[Penguin India, 2024], edited by poet and seeker Arundhathi Subramaniam, is a new anthology of compelling women mystics in Indian literature. \nThese poems are the cries of women who refused, quietly, and sometimes not so quietly, to be bullied into submission. Women who surrendered not to the authority of the world, but to the authority of the spirit. Women whose voices have far too often been sanitized by the grand narratives of religion and sidelined by rationalist versions of history. \nThe names of Mirabai, Akka Mahadevi, and Andal, are known to many. But there are innumerable others. And little is known of the urgency of their words, of their feral sensuality, of their relentless questioning of\u00a0the custodians of gender and faith. It is time to re-fang them, to tune into their brazenness and heartbreaking longing. Not just for their sake, but for ours. \nThis\u00a0conversation with Arundhathi Subramaniam, interspersed by readings of translations by Mani Rao, Vanamala Viswanatha and Ahalya Ballal, will explore some fascinating and unforgettable women. \n",

    "description": "We live in an all-consuming wetness that is everywhere\u00a0in the air, earth, seas, flora and fauna. It precipitates, evaporates, storms, seeps, soaks, transpires, osmotes, condenses. We exist in this \u2018Ocean\u2019 as wet stuff ourselves, our wetness necessary to our existence. However, we are not educated to inhabit this Ocean. We are rather educated to inhabit an Earth with a surface of land served by water confined to a place behind a line. This surfaced Earth, we suggest, is the outcome of a design project intent on making an object that benefits a few at the cost of the many, an object that serves science, civilization and cities, but also colonization and systemic oppression. Today, this Earth is in trouble from climate change, threatened (and violated) by the water it has sought to enslave. It faces sea level rise, floods, increasingly frequent, violent and unpredictable storm events, and the melting of ice caps. To us, these are not problems to solve; they are calls to review a design project that has proved unjust, unwise and disastrous. Does an Ocean of Wetness offer an alternative? \nJoin us as Prof. Dilip da Cunha lays out\u00a0an\u00a0alternative to interpret \u2018landscapes\u2019 as a gradient of wetness over the binary of \u2018land\u2019 and \u2018water\u2019.

    "description": "Karuna or K\u0101runya is one of the navaras\u0101-s (nine emotions) of the Indian cultural pantheon, embodying the highest form of unconditional compassion and mercy. \nSince time immemorial, poets, saints, composers and bhakta-s (devotees) have performed s\u0101dhana (ardent practice of any pursuit) with a yearning for divine Karuna. When Narayana Bhattathiri wrote the magnum opus Narayaneeyam in the 16th century, he said, \u201cOh Krishna, oh K\u0101runya Sindhu! May your feet, where all the liberated souls reside, always rest in my heart. Oh, ocean of compassion, destroy all my sorrows and confer an abundant flow of Supreme Bliss\u201d. In the 19th Century, Patnam Subramania Iyer composed a Kriti pleading Lord Venkatesha to forgive all his sins and bestow abundant Kripa (mercy) with no further delay. Even when we make a prayer today, it is only natural for us to seek the Lord\u2019s Karuna. It is also this very unconditional empathy that we have for one another that makes the world a beautiful place. \nThis concert through the evocative literature and music of composers like Tyagaraja, Patnam Subramania Iyer, the D\u0101s\u0101-s and others, hopes to invoke this Ocean of Mercy, this K\u0101runya Sindhu. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations, the wealth-worth billions in today\u2019s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change \u2013 the emotional and the rational \u2013 and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change\u2014something prevalent in today\u2019s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away.\u00a0The authors will share their insight\u00a0on how it\u2019s imperative to draw lessons from the past, navigate the present, and prepare for the future. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "50 minutes | English and Kannada\u00a0 \nJust Hiss is a compelling adaptation of the short folk story titled A Serpent\u2019s Predicament. Just Hiss\u00a0is an ode to coexistence, following the transformative journey of a snake to choose love over hate. As the play navigates the complex dynamics between the snake, the forest denizens, and the villagers of Rasbharpur, it skillfully tackles the universal themes of unity and understanding. The resonant narrative serves as a reminder of the profound impact that choices, particularly those rooted in love and compassion, can have on fostering harmony in a world shared by diverse beings. \nDirector\u2019s note: \nJust Hiss\u00a0is not just a play; it is a whimsical journey crafted especially for children, featuring endearing animal characters. At its heart, it unfolds an analogical tale, resonant with the pressing message of our times\u2014understanding the limitations of one\u2019s perspective and the imperative need to embrace and accommodate others. \nConceived with meticulous care and having undergone several work-in-progress phases, this play is a testament to the idea that assumptions should yield to genuine inquiry. It serves as a reminder to care enough to ask, fostering the spirit of coming together and progressing impactfully. \n",
