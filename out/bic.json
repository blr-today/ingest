A good moderator has a point of view and \u2013 like \u2018salt to taste\u2019 in any dish \u2013 makes the conversation deep, engaging and participative.\u00a0Good moderators build context, make delicate \u2013 sometimes pointed \u2013 enquiries, navigate difficult terrains, potential conflicts and uncomfortable truths with grace and humour, all the while maintaining the integrity and forward momentum of the conversation.\u00a0They also assess the temperature and shifting temperament of the room, and strive to be the audience\u2019s representative, in turn challenging and coaxing those they are conversing with. \nIn this interactive workshop participants will explore various tools and techniques that will enable them to learn how to become an effective and critical moderator. Through exercises, group discussions and feedback, the workshop will impart practical knowledge on styles and strategies participants can choose from to suit both their personalities as well as the needs of a particular discussion. Finally, it will also provide tips to build confidence and cope with the last minute butterflies-in-the-stomach that is the worry of anyone who has ever \u2013 or never \u2013 walked onto a stage! \nIf you are keen on building a safe and inclusive space, and respectful and inspiring conversations, if you have an opinion but are interested in engaging with others\u2019, if you are \u2013 or want to be \u2013 moderate in truth, temperate in style and obdurate in quest, then this workshop is for you. \n",

    "description": "When rhythm takes flight and grace stands still, something timeless begins to move. \nOn our next evening of Dual Margam, two powerful classical traditions come together in a rare conversation of contrast and convergence. The soaring, drum-led dynamism of Pung Cholom from Manipur, and the grounded, sculptural flow of Odissi from Odisha. \nTraditionally, in Pung Cholom, dancers become percussionists: leaping, spinning, and drumming in mid-air with ecstatic energy and astonishing control. In contrast, Odissi unfolds in slow, sinuous arcs, where each gesture and every glance evokes poetry, myth, and devotion. \nIn this special performance, the two rhythmic traditions of Pung Cholom and Odissi are interwoven and contrasted: bringing fire to form, and pulse to poetry as the dances come together with complementary aesthetics. \nThe first in a two-part Odissi-Manipuri conversation, this evening unfolds through two male bodies and will be revisited next month through the feminine form. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "130 minutes | Malayalam with English subtitles | 1978 | G Aravindan \nA circus tent rises by the river, and with it a world both real and imagined. \nThampu (The Circus Tent) is a luminous blend of documentary and fiction, capturing the arrival of a travelling circus to a quiet village on the banks of Kerala\u2019s Bharatapuzha river. Featuring real circus performers, local villagers, and a cast of non-actors, the film becomes a portrait of the everyday lives that unfold around a spectacle. \nDirected by G. Aravindan and shot by Shaji N. Karun, Thampu marked the second collaboration between two of Indian cinema\u2019s most visionary artists. Filmed in stark black and white on a modest budget, it is a masterclass in restraint and imagination. Every frame holds the weight of directorial decisions: what is showcased, and what is obscured. \nRecently restored by the Film Heritage Foundation and digitised by the National Film Archive of India, Thampu has been rediscovered by global audiences. From the Cannes Classics to the British Film Institute\u2019s Treasures segment, and most recently at the Festival of 3 Continents in Nantes, its revival is a tribute to Aravindan\u2019s enduring cinematic voice. \nFilmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini will introduce the film and moderate a post-screening Q&A. \nNote:\u00a0This special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G. Aravindan and cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun \u2013 both of whom we remember with great reverence.\u00a0BIC aims to pay homage to the iconic duo, and the Parallel Cinema movement they pioneered, through the screening of two films bound by their unique, shared cinematic vision.

    "description": "103 minutes | Malayalam with English subtitles | 1989 | Shaji N Karun \nOne man waits by the river. Every morning, every evening. The bus never comes. \nPiravi (The Birth)\u00a0is a quiet, devastating meditation on loss, hope, and the personal toll of political violence. Based on the life of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier, Piravi is an intimate elegy for a missing son and a father\u2019s unyielding prayer. With unforgettable performances from Lakshmi Krishnamoorthy and Archana, the film has earned nearly 30 international awards, standing as a poignant reminder of how political tragedies are always deeply, painfully personal. \nInspired by the real-life story of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier, whose son disappeared during India\u2019s Emergency in 1976 while studying at the Regional Engineering College in Calicut, Piravi captures the slow unraveling of a family consumed by grief. It is a heartrending portrayal of personal loss and the impact of political oppression. \nKarun\u2019s directorial debut film will be introduced by filmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini, who will also moderate the post-screening Q&A. \nNote:\u00a0This special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G.

    "description": "Storytelling is as old as mankind itself. In recent years there has been a resurgence in Storytelling, applying the narrative process in a wide range of settings, drawing from a variety of origins: in therapy, in community development, in toastmasters clubs, in management, in personal growth labs and so on. It may well become something of a bandwagon soon. \nBangalore Little Theatre (BLT) has developed a unique genre of storytelling theatre, presenting fully rehearsed performances, but in storytelling format. It is called the Courtyard programme. The main features of the programme are:\n\u2013\u00a0Performances in a variety of spaces, not necessarily a stage\n\u2013\u00a0Usually smaller numbers, in intimate surroundings\n\u2013\u00a0Typically two actors \u2013 even one as sometimes done\n\u2013\u00a0No staging requirements of sets, costumes, lights, etc. Just good performance! \nWhat will not be easily seen about Storytelling Theatre is that it requires a specialized approach to content and scripting and, therefore, a specialized technique in performance. Those who have seen BLT performances such as Robi\u2019s Garden and Shakespeare By Any Other Name will understand this readily. \nStorytelling Theatre in India is a relatively new form that is still evolving. Participants in the workshop will be contributing to its development. \nWho is this workshop for? \nThis workshop is meant for those who are already well into the theatre arts and are committed to future work in either theatre making or performance, but with a special interest in Storytelling Theatre. It is not meant for mere \u201corientation\u201d or armchair exploration.\u00a0It will be a doing workshop, covering such objectives as:\n\u2013 To examine and appreciate different forms of Storytelling\n\u2013 To look at the special needs of storytelling theatre\n\u2013 To explore the unique skill sets needed in the actor for the above \u2013 in body, voice and mind\n\u2013 To make a beginning in creating a community of theatre storytellers, committed to developing the form.\n\u2013 The last objective is significant. It is accepted that there can be a limited amount of coverage in a two-day workshop. We hope to continue as a community of storytelling theatre makers. \nPlease note:\u00a0The workshop will be for a limited number of participants. All interested in the workshop are requested to register early. BIC reserves the right to finalize the list of participants.\u00a0There will be no walk-in registrations at the workshop.\u00a0 \n",

Presented by Chandra Jain and designed by Siddhartha Das Studio, the exhibition is a tribute to the artistry, symbolism, and sustainability embedded in every thread of Banaras brocade. \nFrom shimmering motifs inspired by Mughal gardens and temple carvings, to rare handwoven sarees dyed using natural dyes after a gap of 125 years, River Weaves presents a textured narrative of tradition and revival. It highlights the unseen processes behind each masterpiece, degumming, spinning, dyeing, and weaving, while also centring the voices of the weavers, many of whom have inherited and protected this craft for generations. \nBut this tradition is withering. Fewer artisans are able to sustain the work, and the next generation is stepping away. Through this exhibition, we hope to rekindle awareness and inspire a return to wearing and supporting these textiles, because unless people continue to buy, the craft will not survive. \nRiver Weaves is more than a showcase, it\u2019s a call to action. Every Banarasi brocade is not just fabric, but a living story of skill, memory, and community. \nThe concept and vision for the exhibition were conceived by Chandra Jain, a long-time advocate of India\u2019s crafts and textiles.\u00a0The exhibition has been curated by Chiara Nath and Siddhartha Das of Siddhartha Das Studio, an award-winning, multi-disciplinary practice known for its powerful storytelling of India\u2019s cultural heritage. The studio specializes in museums, interpretation centres, exhibitions, and craft installations. Their design brings together historical depth and contemporary relevance, inviting visitors to engage meaningfully with the legacy of Banaras Brocade. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Maya Jayapal\u2019s book, Kaveri: The Journey of a River, traces the author\u2019s journey down the Kaveri river, with her father in the first half, and alone in the second half, after he passed. With charming illustrations by Rohit Bhasi, the book takes the reader from Talakaveri to Poompuhar with historical and religious sites, people, culture, flora and fauna, and much more along the way. \nThe author of two books on Bangalore, one on Djakarta and one on Singapore, cities where she has lived, she says, \u201cI chose to write my story of a river as I got tired of writing about cities. I had just finished writing about Bangalore which is changing too rapidly for my liking. I wanted to discover something more natural, something more ancient, something that had been an inspiration for civilisations, something that embodied life eternal, life giving and life sustaining. And so, I chose a river, a river that flows in my own backyard, so to speak.\u201d \n\u00a0 \nImage Credit\nBook cover illustration by Rohit Bhasi.\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nPresented by the Jayapal family \n",

    "description": "53 minutes | Urdu with English subtitles | 2020 | India \nAs a woman\u2019s faith becomes her fire, what can stand in her way? \nIn the heart of Bhopal, where tradition runs deep and silence often surrounds resistance, Safia, a devout Muslim woman, quietly begins a revolution. When her husband invokes triple talaq and divorces her in her own absence, she turns to seek justice.\u00a0 \nHoly Rights is an intimate, unflinching documentary tracing Safia\u2019s courageous journey as she navigates uncharted territory, confronting resistance and reshaping narratives that profoundly impact women\u2019s lives. She challenges centuries of patriarchal tradition by training to become a Qazi \u2013 an interpreter and authority of Islamic personal law. Her decision, rooted in faith and a deep sense of justice, sets in motion a ripple effect among other Muslim women, who begin to reimagine their place in both religion and society. \nThe film unfolds over four years capturing landmark political shifts, the fight against the practice of triple talaq, and the quiet courage of women who refuse to be spoken for by religious authorities, political actors, or even well-meaning allies. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with filmmaker Farha Khatun and producer Priyanka More, who will be joining us online, and a Q&A with the audience. \nHere is the trailer of the film. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "A poet\u2019s prerogative is to witness life. \nSiddhartha Menon\u2019s poetry belongs to a modern practice, going back to around 1900, of creating poems through spells of intense attention to non-human life for its own sake. This evening will begin with a conversation between Menon and Prashant Keshavmurthy on how two of Menon\u2019s six poem collections \u2013 The Compass Bird (2023) and Lone Pine (2025) \u2013 relate to this modern poetic practice. Together, they\u2019ll trace the lineage of a quiet but radical poetic tradition that resists metaphor, transcends language, and pulls attention. \nWhile the natural world has always been a favourite muse of the human mind, select poets have found powerful anecdotes to draw their readers in. Pushing past the self-centred gaze so familiar to us, the lyrical observations of this style asks us to witness the fascinating creatures with whom we share this world.\u00a0 \nClosing with a Q&A open to the audience, this event promises insights, inspiration, and immersion. \n",

    "description": "Far from home, polished and perched, lie countless Indian artefacts.  \nStories of their acquisition, passed down through generations, often obscure the brutal realities of conquest, coercion and plunder. Taken as prized trophies during colonial rule, these objects have sat in museums and private collections for centuries.\u00a0 \nIn this talk, journalist and author Shyam Bhatia brings a deeply personal story to light: the journey of a centuries-old Indian artefact passed down through a British military family. Through this single heirloom, he opens up the layered questions of cultural memory, ownership, and the unfinished business of historical justice. \nFollowing the talk, Bhatia will be in conversation with art historian and curator Dr Arnika Ahldag, exploring the roles institutions and individuals play in shaping and restoring the narratives of the past. \nThis evening invites reflection, curiosity, and conversation that lingers beyond the final word. Bring your questions to the audience Q&A at the end of the session!  \n",

This album is named \u2018Boat on the River\u2019 a mystical representation of human life as a living, loving boat, that floats on forever. \nThis music in turn serendipitously connected them with the famous artist from Kolkata Asit Poddar who has also been visiting Benares and painting many works based on his muse awakened there. The paintings and music combine in music videos to express a glimpse of the mystique of Ganga Maiya. The album is proposed to be released at the Kala Yatra festival at Kashi on march 8, 2024. The group have embarked on a journey to share this experience around India and worldwide. They now conduct Art &amp; Music Festivals on the Benares Ghats and other cities called Kala Yatri. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Pooja Kunita, the ritual folk dance of Mandya, blends spirituality, storytelling, music, and acrobatic artistry into a vibrant act of devotion. Presented by Sri Vinayaka Yuvakara Kala Balaga and led by K.B. Swamy, this 60-minute interactive program unfolds as an immersive journey through the traditions, symbols, and sounds of this living heritage. \nGuided by a Sutradar, the experience begins with an introduction to Pooja Kunita\u2019s history and cultural significance, before artists perform a small pooja to the Goddess and demonstrate the intricate decoration of the sacred prayer frame. The ceremonial invocation follows, revealing the chants, gestures, and symbolic rituals that open every performance.\u00a0Audiences will explore the distinctive soundscape of traditional instruments like the Tamte, Nagarai, and Tarsi, and be invited to learn foundational dance steps (Hejjes) alongside the artists. The program builds with a demonstration of the acrobatic grace at the heart of Pooja Kunita, offering insight into how athletic skill and spiritual intent intertwine. The evening culminates in a full, high-energy performance that weaves together frame decoration, invocation, music, hejjes, and acrobatics\u2014offering a complete, living portrait of this devotional art form. \nThis is the fourth performance of our series\u00a0BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka\u2019s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression.\u00a0Through demonstrations, performances, and academic discussions, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "At the edge of legend and longing, two women wait for the same god. \nKalatra is a dance-theatre work by Keelaka Dance Company that reimagines the story of Murugan and his two consorts (Valli and Devanai) not as divine footnotes, but as women bound by love, rivalry, and fate. In the classical Hindu tradition, Murugan\u2019s union with both is a symbol of completeness, of sacred balance. But in Sri Lanka\u2019s local poetic lore, a quieter, more human story unfolds. \nThe journey begins in Kataragama, where Murugan is worshipped not just by Hindus, but by Buddhists, Muslims, and indigenous tribes. Each finds a reflection of their own devotion in his form. Here, the story of Valli takes root, even as the shrine of Devanai turns away. Locals say she cannot bear to see her lord walk each night to Valli\u2019s side. \nBlending Bharatanatyam and contemporary dance, Kalatra draws from mythology, regional poetry, and imagined memory. Presented by the Keelaka Dance Company, conceived by Jyotsna Shourie and Aneesha Grover, with music by Daniel B George, OS Arun, and Madstarbase. \nA performance where myth breathes, and devotion speaks! \nIn Collaboration with: \n \n\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n \n",
