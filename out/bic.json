    "description": "This is a BIC Elsewhere event at Sabha: An Arts and Crafts Shaale \nSince its origins in the 18th century, the piano has been used by composers to describe places, events, and even to conjure up the sounds of other instruments, from solo violins to full symphony orchestras. In this introduced \u2018conversational\u2019 concert, Karl Lutchmayer will guide his audience through more than a century of piano music, exploring the endless versatility of the instrument in bringing real and imagined worlds to life. Along the way, he will play works by some of the most important piano composers, including Beethoven, Liszt and Debussy. \n \nThis is a BIC Elsewhere Event \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences.

    "description": "Imagine a world without hunger and malnutrition. What would it take to achieve a genuinely food-secure world\u2014where every person gets to consume the right quantity and quality of food to live a healthy, active, and productive life? \nAchieving and sustaining such a future requires transforming how our food is grown, managed, distributed, and consumed. From production to consumption, our food systems must be more sustainable, halting environmental degradation, and even repairing the damage we have previously done. \nGlenn Denning\u2019s Universal Food Security: How to End Hunger While Protecting the Planet presents a bold, evidence-based, practical guide to food systems transformation. He bridges the divisive worlds of science, policy, and practice. By synthesizing the most relevant literature, consulting the world\u2019s foremost experts, and sharing personal insights gained over four decades, Denning lays out five priority areas for action and investment. \nBut in Universal Food Security, Denning goes beyond what needs to change. He goes on to tackle the challenges of implementation. Echoing the words of his mentor, the late Professor MS Swaminathan, Denning argues that we need the knowhow and the do-how to transform our food systems.\u00a0 \nUniversal Food Security\u00a0calls for a new generation of enlightened practitioner-leaders\u2014acting on their own and with others, through institutions\u2014to achieve a food-secure world. \nImage Captions:\nThumbnail, Poster and Header: Rice crops in Cambodia\nInstastory: Maize crops in Malawi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",
