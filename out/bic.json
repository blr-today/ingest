    "description": "Nirvrithi is a state of inexplicable ecstasy. \nThrough the medium of Bharatanatyam, Shijith N Parvathy takes you on a journey in pursuit of this eternal bliss, the ultimate experience.\u00a0In Bharatanatyam, the Margam is a path that unravels a seeking. Through this path the dancer attains Nirvrithi. \nThe concept of Satchitananda described in the central piece of the performance is what\u00a0Shijith N Parvathy through their conceptual choreographic Margam takes you to experience. Nirvrithi is woven from manifested inner thoughts to stimulate the body, mind and soul. \nFor Shijith N Parvathy, Bharatanatyam is a spiritual recourse and Nirvrithi is their experience. \nThis is the fourth edition of the \u2018All For Dance\u2019 series presented by Kalavaahini in association with BIC curated by Malavika Sarukkai.

    "description": "Many years ago, in Detroit during a chance meeting with Jerry Murad of the Harmonicats, a commitment was made. Sulaiman Jamal met Jerry Murad at a harmonica convention, and he asked Sulaiman to continue playing the chromatic harmonica. He highlighted the versatility and beauty of the small instrument. That was Sulaiman\u2019s motivation and inspiration to continue playing the unique instrument which he had actually put in cold storage. \nWhile Jerry had passed away many years ago, Sulaiman was reminded by a mutual friend that he had not fulfilled Jerry\u2019s request \u2013 This concert is to do just that. \nThe theme of the concert is to cover some of the greatest Broadway and cinema themes, mainly from yesteryear which have warmed our hearts. \nThe evening will include favourites from Phantom of the Opera, The Wizard of Oz, Jesus Christ Superstar, Fiddler on the Roof and more. Not to forget the classics from The Beatles, Leonard Cohen, Simon and Garfunkel, and Big Band and Blues numbers. \nWith a group of extremely talented and accomplished musicians, the evening can\u2019t be anything but memorable. The magic of the Harmonica and an incredible music ensemble awaits you. \nPresented by: \n \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Langa and Manganiyar musicians of Rajasthan are a hereditary community of professional musicians from the villages of Barmer, Balotra, Jodhpur, Phalodi and Jaisalmer in the desert areas of western Rajasthan.\u00a0They have a vast repertoire of folk music integral to their way of life and social systems. Their music, which has been preserved and passed down through generations, acts as a medium of information and storytelling, much like the postcards in your exhibition. \nThe Manganiars\u2019 music has survived for decades thanks to the traditional Jajmani (patronage) system, which supports their art form and livelihood. Their music has continued to survive for decades mainly because of the Jajmani (patronage) system, which is fundamental to their art form as well as the source of traditional livelihood. These traditional patrons have been supporting the economy of the communities of Langa and Manganiyar musicians for generations. \nAn eight-member team led by Sardar Khan Langa & Sawai Khan Manganiyar will present traditional folk music of Rajasthan along with Kalbeliya song & dance. Sardar Khan is a senior Langa guru, a very knowledgeable\u00a0person of Barnawa Jageer, and has traveled\u00a0worldwide to present traditional folk music.

    "description": "What is nature?\u00a0Though it is a term used so ubiquitously, its meaning has been debated and questioned, changing with each era. While trees, animals and the planets are considered natural elements, it is the human relationship to nature that concerns us the most. Aren\u2019t humans too part of nature, rather than external to it? What is the relationship between humans and nature? Is it merely utilitarian, or is there hope that can it be something more? \nMusical Ecologies is an exploration of how music and art can answer such questions for us, by showing us how to experience nature as a world of emotion. Hindustani music has a long tradition of celebrating natural beauty and seasons. These compositions capture the subjective human response to nature, locating humans very much inside the natural ecosystem as co-habitants. Perhaps by relating to nature on its own terms rather than from a position of control or exploitation, we can contemplate a symbiotic model of living for the future. \nHindustani vocalist Priya Purushothaman presents bandishes and raags that celebrate the environment and its rich ecosystems, interspersed with commentary addressing these philosophical questions, suggesting a way of bringing together environmental consciousness and music. \nThe session will also include readings and a discussion with Musician, Playwright and Social Justice Worker Rumi Harish. \n\u00a0 \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "90 minutes | Hindi | Suitable for 16 years+\n\nOn a day unknown, at a place not known, two people run into one another. They soon start talking to each other, but they seem to be conversing at cross purposes. They seem to be long-lost lovers but, at the same time, seem to be perfect strangers. They seem to have had a life together but, at the same time, seem to have had lives apart. They seem to occupy differing realities but simultaneously seem to be in someone\u2019s dream. Who are they?\u00a0Where are they?\u00a0Are they actually strangers?\u00a0Or do they indeed know each other?\u00a0Is this even real?\nOr is it only someone\u2019s imagination? \nDirector\u2019s Note:\u00a0 \nThe experience of writing this play, and now producing and directing it for the stage, have been cathartic and instrumental in helping me emerge from a difficult year. I am now eager to see how audiences respond to this attempt by our merry band of artists to tell a story from all our lives. I am absolutely swept with the power of community as I see how the cast and crew has worked relentlessly to bring Silvatein on stage, amidst laughter, excitement and pure joy of working together.\u00a0It is a prime example of the passion, honesty and commitment that brings forward a story about two individuals caught in a web of lies or deceit or it something completely imaginative. This play is intensely special to me, not only because I have written and directed it but also because the themes and characters are inspired from real life and real incidents that will provoke the audience to reflect on their own experiences. Silvatein is a piece of writing that managed to paint a picture of a world of intimate details that devastates Rupali and Arijit and somehow manages to be bite sized.\u00a0The characters are delightfully complex and multifaceted and the story feels comfortingly familiar. \nCredit List: \nSet Design: Puneet Gupta and Prachi Kalra\nLight Design: Srinivas Beesetty,\nPoster Design: Sweta Garg\nProduction Manager: Archana Kariappa and Sandeep Jain\nWritten and Directed by: Shatarupa Bhattacharyya\nCast: Ujani Ghosh and Sagnik Sinha \nSupported by \n \n",

    "description": "Puertos de Tango (Tango Ports) aims to revisit lesser-known themes of great Uruguayan authors, thus keeping wonderful compositions alive. The project includes a special tribute to Astor Piazzolla and the great Uruguayan poet Horacio Ferrer, evoking much of their creative duo and reinterpreting part of their repertoire inspired by the artists\u2019 homeland, Uruguay. In this kind of cosmopolitan tango without temporal and spatial boundaries, some versions in Italian and French are included, justified in the words of Ram\u00f3n Pelinski (Argentine ethnomusicologist and composer) who describes tango as a \u201cglobal metaphor\u201d: a tango with infinite possibilities, capable of imagining and travelling to other worlds, without fear that \u201cits entire life is yesterday, holding it in its past.\u201d \nNatalia Bolani seeks her own interpretation from her perspective as an actor, resignifying and valuing the chosen texts through contemporary sounds, mainly appealing to the sound of the piano and the bandone\u00f3n, instruments with strong organic and referential connotations in Rio de la Plata culture. \nThe project intends to attract new audiences to this genre, as well as to offer a repertoire not usually enjoyed by those more familiar with the music. Its raison d\u2019\u00eatre is, ultimately, the encounter with the emotions, a meeting where interpretive and sonorous power intermingle in the same waters, in a kind of cathartic ritual through artistic creation. \nPresented by\u00a0the Embassy of Uruguay and MLC Estates LLP \n\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Ardha \u2013 The Incomplete Dream is a solo work born out of a collection of essays contained in the book, Finding Radha by Namita Gokhale and Malashri Lal. Weaving together Bharatanatyam and spoken word, Ardha looks at Radha as the \u2018adhara\u2019 in whom the essence of Krishna is held. Beyond her oft-recognized status as Krishna\u2019s lover and his chosen gopi, Radha is \u2018Hladini Shakti\u2019 \u2013 the potency that is half of Krishna, their spirits engaged in perpetual \u2018Lila Hava\u2019- the exchange of ornaments, attire, and souls. \nCould Radha be an illusion that, through her dhara (flow) of joy and pain in union and separation, symbolizes the yearning for something beyond, a yearning that exists in every human? What happened to Radha after Krishna left Mathura? Why is Krishna celebrated while Radha, is a mere shadow in her aradhana to him? \nCredits:  \n\u2013 Concept, Choreography, Dance, Spoken word: Vidhya Subramanian \n\u2013 Music Composition: Shreya Devnath \n\u2013 Sound track produced at Resound India and mixed and mastered by Sai Shravanam \n\u2013 Musicians: Keerthana Vaidyanathan, Shreya Devnath, Sivaprasad, Sruti Sagar, Sai Shravanam, Manonmani, Vidhya Subramanian \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "India, being one of the developing countries in the world, does face many challenges when it comes to taking up specific developmental projects for the benefit of the people. Natural resources management and societal applications are the biggest areas for India where the Government spends lots of funds for the benefit of its people. \nGovernment spendings of public money in many important areas, such as, building rural and urban infrastructure, programs on land & water conservation, agriculture, water, forests, energy and many others to ensure sustainable development of all basic needs of the people, are efforts towards achieving our sustainable developmental goals. This calls for meticulous planning and well-orchestrated implementation and monitoring. \nSpace technology provides many interesting solutions in terms of Earth observation, communication and GNSS based solutions. The presentation brings out specific areas where such solutions are being provided to the Government using space technology so that the goals of development and governance are met amicably. \nThe talk by Prof. Diwakar will be followed by a discussion with Ecologist, Harini Nagendra. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nThis session is part of the Let\u2019s Talk Climate Change Talk series. \nPresented by: \n \n",
