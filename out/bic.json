    "description": "The object of this lecture is to analyze the world order that was put in place at the end of World War II, examine how it has unfolded in terms of experience since then, and highlight some important manifestations of its multiple crises, to discuss possible future scenarios for 2050. In doing so, it asks four questions and seeks to provide answers. \nAre we witnessing the beginnings of a transformative change in the world order? Are we at the cusp of an emerging bi-polar world order, with the United States and China as the two superpowers? Are we moving towards a multi-polar world, in which there will be another 8-10 countries that are also key players? Are we going to live with a fluid situation and a\u00a0de facto\u00a0continuation of\u00a0Pax Americana? \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Ranis of India is a theatrical storytelling performance that brings to life the forgotten and lesser-known queens of India. Drawing from oral traditions and historical narratives, Vikram Sridhar weaves together tales of women rulers who shaped the course of history across different regions and time periods. \nOver the course of an hour, through the art of oral storytelling interwoven with folk songs, we embark on a journey across India\u2014uncovering the myths, histories, and contemporary echoes of remarkable queens whose legacies deserve to be remembered. From North to South, East to West, these powerful women left an indelible mark on history, yet their stories remain largely untold. This performance seeks to reclaim their voices and bring them to the forefront. \nThis event is part of\u00a0Unheard Narratives, BIC\u2019s programmes to commemorate Women\u2019s Day 2025. It celebrates the power of unheard narratives\u2014spotlighting the resilience, artistry, and impact of women whose stories have shaped India\u2019s cultural and social fabric. Through performances, talks, and films, we bring these voices to the forefront. \n",

    "description": "When\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi\u00a0Arundale founded Kalakshetra in 1936, she did not intend to create a new style of Bharatnatyam. Yet, the Kalakshetra bani emerged\u2014a new approach that distinguished itself from the traditional \u2018sadir\u2019 style.\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi\u2019s choreography blended classical purity with innovative storytelling, giving rise to a new school of Bharatanatyam that balanced tradition with modern sensibilities. \nOver two decades ago, Kalakshetra alumna Swagata Sen Pillai began curating Smriti Pravah in memory of\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi, celebrating her legacy on her birth anniversary and bringing together Kalakshetra students worldwide to honor their guru. After Swagata\u2019s untimely passing due to COVID, her friends and seniors from Kalakshetra, Tripti Bhupen and Archita Mehta, have continued this tradition. \nIn 2025, on\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi\u2019s 121st anniversary, Archita Mehta\u2019s NrityaSadhana Centre for Bharatanatyam and Indian Folk Dances, and Tripti Bhupen\u2019s Samarpan School of Performing Arts take a journey into her creative world, where she preserved Bharatanatyam\u2019s traditions while innovating within its structure. \nThe performance will be in two parts: the first will highlight pieces from the margam choreographed by\u00a0Rukmini\u00a0Devi\u2019s direct disciples, while the second will explore her timeless dance dramas. \nThis year\u2019s performers include Kalakshetra alumni Archita Mehta, Tripti Bhupen, Gayatri Krishnaveni Lakshmanan, Vasundhara Thomas, Priyashri Rao, Lasya Priya R, and Nrithika B Natesh. \nPresented by: \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "On September 17, 1949, C.N. Annadurai (Anna) founded the DMK after splitting with Periyar E.V. Ramaswamy. The party steadily gained mass appeal, shedding its separatist stance in 1962 and winning power in Tamil Nadu in 1967. Since then, it has remained a major force, first under M. Karunanidhi and now under M.K. Stalin. \nDespite political upheavals\u2014including M.G. Ramachandran\u2019s 1972 split, its 1976 ousting during the Emergency, dismissal in 1991 over alleged LTTE ties, and a 1993 split\u2014the DMK has endured, reclaiming power in 2021. \nKnown for its pioneering welfare policies, the DMK now promotes its \u2018Dravidian Model\u2019 as a national alternative, emphasizing Tamil cultural nationalism and cooperative federalism. Yet, 75 years on, it faces challenges from caste-based and nationalist forces, as well as accusations of corruption and dynastic rule. \nAt this crucial juncture, veteran political commentator R. Kannan examines the DMK\u2019s journey and future, offering an objective and comprehensive account of its role in Tamil Nadu politics. \nAuthor R. Kannan will be in conversation with Author & Editor Karthik Venkatesh. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "In this talk, Norman Sartorius emphasizes the critical need to address the challenges faced by caregivers of individuals with mental illness. Often overlooked, these caregivers, typically family members, find themselves thrust into unfamiliar roles, grappling with feelings of guilt, shame, fear and burnout. Caregivers, often also women, also find themselves facing the harshest stigma and judgement. They navigate complex emotions and uncertainties about their impact on their loved one\u2019s illness. Sartorius advocates for focusing on supporting and empowering caregivers as a crucial starting point in improving mental health care. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "description": "\n54 minutes |\u00a0English, Hindi, Kannada | Suitable for 13+ Years\nTrigger Warnings: Themes of Loneliness\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDo you ever feel alone, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends\u2026 Yet, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together, drifting apart, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise\u2026 \nThis is an adaptation of \u201cBh\u016bmikampa \u2013 Das Erdbeben\u201d which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n\u201cMira and Sameer find themselves surrounded by unspoken words. \u2018The Earthquake\u2019 delves into the essence of human relationships\u2014our connections, routines, distances, and all the spaces in between. It asks us what it means to be truly seen or heard. What happens when we finally face the unspoken truths in our interpersonal relationships?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0 \nCredits: \nPlaywrights: Marvin Krause and Samragni Dasgupta\nDirector: Shania Mathew \nCast: \nMira: Samragni Dasgupta\nSameer: Naman Roy \nThe Earthquake received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt M\u00fcnchen Kulturreferat (City of Munich). \nProduced by\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nWith Support from \n\n \n\n",

    "description": "Mai Ri\u00a0beautifully captures the legacy and struggles of two extraordinary women in Indian classical music: Padmabhushan Gaanatapaswini Mogubai Kurdikar and her daughter, Padmavibhushan Gaanasaraswati Kishori Amonkar. Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar, an eminent vocalist of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana, navigated a time when women in music faced societal and institutional barriers. Through sheer dedication and artistic brilliance, she not only earned her place as one of the most revered figures in classical music but also ensured that her daughter and disciple, Kishori Amonkar, became one of the most influential vocalists of her era. \nConceptualized by noted vocalist Radhika Joshi, who carries forward this lineage as a disciple of Pt. Raghunandan Panshikar (a senior disciple of Kishori Amonkar and student of Mogubai Kurdikar), Mai Ri\u00a0is a thematic presentation that brings alive their musical and personal journeys. Through a carefully curated selection of bandishes composed by Mai (Mogubai Ji) and Kishoritai, Radhika interweaves music with storytelling, sharing anecdotes from their lives that offer a rare glimpse into their artistic and emotional worlds. \nRadhika Joshi will be accompanied by Sumith Naik on Tabla and Surya Upadhyay on Harmonium, enriching the performance with their artistry. \nThis event is part of\u00a0Unheard Narratives, BIC\u2019s programmes to commemorate Women\u2019s Day 2025. It celebrates the power of unheard narratives\u2014spotlighting the resilience, artistry, and impact of women whose stories have shaped India\u2019s cultural and social fabric. Through performances, talks, and films, we bring these voices to the forefront. \n",
