    "description": "What happens when the story parents tell themselves begins to unravel? \nThings I Know to Be True opens inside a household that appears settled, successful, and certain of its own choices. The parents believe they have raised four responsible, self-sufficient children. Yet, as the family gathers and life quietly intervenes, that confidence begins to fracture. Each child stands at a turning point (some comic, some devastating) forcing the family to confront what growing up truly costs, and what letting go really means. \nWritten by Australian playwright Andrew Bovell and directed by Delhi-based veteran theatre-maker Feisal Alkazi, the play traces the intimate tremors beneath everyday life: marriages that settle into routine, careers that falter, identities that refuse to stay hidden, and parents learning (often painfully) that love cannot protect against every fall. With deeply universal themes, the play has resonated across continents, becoming one of the world\u2019s most performed scripts in recent years. \nFamiliar lives, difficult choices, and the tender ache of watching those we love grow in unexpected ways. \nProduced in arrangement with Nick Hern Books \n\n\nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "This conversation will shift your understanding of power, and of possibility. \nIn this session Rahila Gupta will examine how male dominance persists across radically different societies from theocracies to democracies, dictatorships to socialist states. Her co-authored book Planet Patriarchy asks what makes patriarchy so resilient, and where feminism is not just surviving but genuinely thriving. \nAt the heart of the conversation is a revelation: a little-known women\u2019s revolution in Rojava, Northeast Syria. Here, women are building a bottom-up democracy rooted in multi-ethnic inclusivity and ecological sustainability. It\u2019s a radical reimagining of power that challenges everything we think we know about governance and gender. \nConcluding with an audience Q&A, this session invites you to rethink power, resilience, and the possibilities of feminist futures, one where gender equality isn\u2019t an afterthought but the foundation. \n",

    "description": "A society fails not when it lacks talent, but when talent has nowhere to go. \nIn this lecture, Professor Anirudh Krishna invites us to reimagine opportunity not as luck or merit, but as something societies deliberately construct. Drawing on over a decade of global research across countries and contexts, this lecture asks an uncomfortable question: how much potential are we wasting when millions operate far below what they\u2019re truly capable of? \nThrough stories of nations that have successfully built strong pathways to success, we\u2019ll explore the architecture of progress: the schools, networks, policies, and cultural shifts that turn capacity into achievement. This isn\u2019t your average abstract policy talk but rather a conversation to understand the structures that launch young people toward their dreams or leave them stranded. \nWhether you\u2019re an educator, policymaker, parent, or simply someone who cares about untapped potential, this conversation will reshape how you think about development and the futures we\u2019re building together! \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "80 minutes | English & Marathi with English subtitles | India | 2025 \nScholarship and resistance bridged by love. \nA documentary that traces the shared journey of US-born Indian sociologist and Dalit rights activist Dr. Gail Omvedt and activist-intellectual Dr. Bharat Patankar, this film situates their personal story within the larger arc of India\u2019s socio-political movements. Charting Omvedt\u2019s path from America to western Maharashtra, her deep engagement with Dalit-Bahujan politics, and a life of thought and action shaped alongside Patankar, Gail & Bharat\u00a0brings out the personal in the political. \nSet largely in Kasegaon, where the couple lived and worked for decades, the film foregrounds voices and struggles long ignored by mainstream media and academia. It reflects Omvedt\u2019s seminal contributions to anti-caste studies and her role in building global intellectual conversations around Phule and Ambedkar, while also capturing Patankar\u2019s grassroots leadership through movements for land, water, and dignity. Tender, political, and quietly moving, the documentary preserves the legacy of two organic intellectuals whose lives blurred the boundaries between scholarship, activism, and everyday care. \nThe screening will be followed by a conversation between filmmaker Somnath Waghmare and investigative journalist Sudipto Mondal, and will subsequently conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

Each phrase is carefully placed, each turn of the raag revealed with patience, creating a sound world that is poised, reflective, and deeply attentive to nuance. \nHere, taan and tarana are not displays of speed but acts of expression. Taan\u00a0flows like extended sentences: supple, voice-led, and melodic. Tarana unfolds as song rather than spectacle, its syllables shaped for balance and resonance. The music lingers, listens, and slowly opens outward, inviting the raag to show its many shades. \nA contemplative experience of khayal from a unique tradition. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "A tradition stays alive not by preservation alone, but by the courage to reimagine. \nThis concert pays homage to the Hindustani classical musicians of the 20th century: artists who honoured an ancient lineage while boldly reshaping it for a changing world. As India awakened to independence, they too evolved with it, expanding melodic possibilities, reimagining rhythm, and infusing contemporary thought into timeless ragas. Legends such as Pt. Dinkar Kaikini, Pt. Kumar Gandharva, Vid. Prabha Atre, Vid. Veena Sahasrabuddhe, Begum Akhtar, and Farida Khanum helped forge a modern, resonant Hindustani idiom whose influence endures today. \nMaahi and Neil revisit this rich inheritance through ragas like Yaman Kalyan, Bihag, Multani, and Bhairavi, alongside select semi-classical pieces. Both artistes will present vocal works. Maahi will be accompanied by Neil on the Appalachian dulcimer, while Neil\u2019s performance will feature Aniket on classical electric guitar. Kaushik will provide the rhythmic accompaniment on tabla for both. \nAn evening to honour the musicians who made this music timeless. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "This edition of My Guru, My Art offers a distinctive lens on legacy. While the life and work of Vidushi Lalith J Rao are traced through the voices and performances of her students, a personal perspective is brought in by her husband, Shri N. Jayavanth Rao, who will be present on her behalf. The performances will be accompanied by Surya Upadhya on the harmonium and Yogeesh Bhat on the tabla. Through a careful weaving of conversation and live music, the programme reflects on Vidhushi Lalithji\u2019s journey from early training in Bengaluru to her stature as a leading torchbearer of the Agra\u2013Atrauli Gharana, and on the values she shaped and passed on. Curated and scripted by Manohar Patwardhan and Tara Kini, the evening is both a tribute and a heartfelt celebration of a luminous journey. \nThe Guru-Shishya parampara has been integral to the learning of Indian classical dance and music art forms: a deeply immersive and rigorous tradition that holds its own even in the modern context. A profound emotional and spiritual bond forms between teacher and student, through which not just the practice and knowledge of art, but also a way of life is transmitted down the generations. The Guru goes beyond the imparting of technicalities and nuances of art to shape and hone the Shishya\u2019s voice, indeed, the artistic identity. The Shishya, part of a lineage that connects to the Guru\u2019s Gurus, links the past with the future, carrying this tradition to a new generation of artistes and audiences. \nThis series, My Guru, My Art\u00a0 takes an intimate look at this tradition and hopes to capture for posterity the stories of how the magic is created. In these sessions artistes explore personal histories of learning a classical art form, sharing memories of interactions with their teachers, inspirations, influences, anecdotes of compositions and teaching moments, punctuated by music to illustrate the stories. \nSupported by: \n \n",

This documentary reveals the cost of this misnaming. Not only is the survival of species such as the blackbuck, caracal, and great Indian bustard at risk, but also a deeper understanding of how life persists in these seemingly spare terrains. \nMoving beyond wildlife portraiture, the film traces the intricate web of life sustained by grasslands, weaving together ecological science, lived knowledge, and cultural memory. Through voices of local communities, researchers, and conservationists, it challenges the hierarchy of what is deemed worthy of care, asking what happens when we fail to protect what is not glorified. \nThis film is a mark of the wider movement calling for attention, humility, and responsibility toward ecosystems that quietly sustain us all. \nThe screening is followed by a conversation with filmmaker Sumanth Kuduvalli and behavioural ecologist Kavita Isvaran, concluding with an audience Q&A. \n",

And did earlier societies view elopement as a legitimate response when love collided with social expectations, or has our romanticization of it obscured more complex truths? \nAn evening that moves between myth and modernity, romance and reality. \n",

    "description": "Can a dancer hold rhythm in her feet, melody in her voice, and an instrument in her hands? \nThis performance brings Indian classical dance, music, and rhythm into conversation. Rooted in Kathak and reaching across vocals, sitar and tabla, the production traces how movement, melody, and taal speak to one another: not as separate disciplines, but rather, as interwoven modes of expression. \nThe performance features a rare Kathak Yoga segment, where the dancer sings the rhythmic cycle, plays an instrument, and dances complex mathematical patterns simultaneously. It also ventures into a 5\u00bd-beat cycle, an unusual rhythmic inquiry, followed by an unconventional jugalbandi that draws the entire musical ensemble into spontaneous dialogue with the dance.\u00a0 \nThe evening unfolds a porous performance space where roles blur and expression travels freely between body, voice, and rhythm.\u00a0 \nSupported by:\n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "A princess who walked away from the palace. A woman who defied family, society and expectations to sing her devotion. Meera\u2019s voice rings through centuries, distinct and uncompromising. \nIn a canon dominated by male Bhakti and Sufi mystic poets, Meera carved her own path. Her songs speak of pure, love-filled devotion to Krishna, but they also explore complex yogic ideas that challenge our understanding of spiritual practice. She didn\u2019t just worship: she wandered, questioned, and transformed herself into a yogini free from the expectations placed on the women of her time. \nThis musical session explores the many colours of Meera through folk songs from Rajasthan and beyond. Vipul Rikhi will trace how her voice differs from her male contemporaries, how her femininity shapes her devotion and how her rebellion becomes inseparable from her spirituality.\u00a0 \nA chance to hear Meera as a radical figure who redefined what devotion could mean. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Crossing genres and geographies, this performance is truly unique! \nThis collaboration began as a musical conversation across distance: between Appalachian folk traditions rooted in storytelling, the improvisational language of jazz, and the raga-based imagination of Indian classical music. Davis & Haleigh, a violin and acoustic guitar duo from Birmingham, Alabama, come together with Bengaluru-based Carnatic fusion artist Vishnu R to explore what happens when distinct musical lineages meet without hierarchy, and with curiosity leading the way. \nAt the heart of the performance is dialogue: between strings and rhythm, structure and spontaneity, memory and invention. Davis & Haleigh\u2019s intricate interplay is woven into Vishnu\u2019s explorations on the Navtar, his self-designed nine-string instrument that blends fretted, fretless, and harp-like textures. Fresh from a US tour, this India and Southeast Asia debut carries music shaped by travel, trust, and attentive listening. \nGenres blur, and geographies dissolve, as music takes on a new form. \nSupported by: \n \n",
