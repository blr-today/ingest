Weaver, mystic, poet, Shah Hussain kept away from \u2018peeri\u2019, \u2018meeri\u2019, all kinds of high sounding titles, he lives in our hearts as \u2018faqeer nimaana\u2019 (the lowly faqeer). \nMela Chiraaga\u2019an Urs is celebrated every year in remembrance of this poet faqeer Shah Hussain and his beloved disciple, a Hindu Brahmin boy Madho Lal, as they lie buried in their twin graves near Lahore. So inextricably connected, Shah Husain is also remembered as Madho Lal Hussain. 2024 marks Madho lal Hussain\u2019s 436th Urs, his death anniversary, a celebration of the final union with the beloved divine ( \u2018Urus\u2019 in Arabic is a wedding) \nThis Mela, a confluence of his poetry, woven with music and narrative, is his journey as a Julaaha (weaver), a \u2018malaamati\u2019, as Faqeer Nimaana, the lowly faqeer. It celebrates Punjab\u2019s common cultural landscape, the common poetry, the language, the voice, which remains one despite the border that separates us. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "90 Minutes | Hindi (Tukaram abhangs will be sung in Marathi) | Ages 16 years + \nThis play is an adaptation of the seminal Marathi novel \u2018Anandowari\u2019 written by D.B. Mokashi in 1974. \nAnandowari (English translation: \u2018The Verandah of Bliss\u2019) looks at 17th-century saint poet Tukaram\u2019s story through his younger brother Kanha\u2019s perspective. Tukaram has gone missing again. This time, though, the hints seem ominous. We travel through those 3 days of Kanha\u2019s frantic search for Tuka and his many realisations about his brother. \nIn reminiscing about Tukaram, Kanha tries to grapple with Tuka\u2019s many identities: Tuka his brother, the son, the householder, the creative genius, a saint, a reformer, a rebel. \nThis act of reminiscence becomes an act of grappling with what and who he has lost, in the process giving us a great psychological insight into the events (personal, social and political) and impulses that shaped Tukaram\u2019s consciousness and made him who he was: one of the most beloved Bhakti saint poets of Maharashtra, as tender as he was fierce, as compassionate as he was unforgivingly harsh, as much a reformist as he was a transcendentalist. \nOur adaptation focuses on the search that lies at the heart of the text: a devotee in search of God, a man in search of his brother, a writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nCredits: \nOriginal Novel Anandowari by D.B Mokashi\nAdaptation and Direction: Gerish Khemani\nHindi Translation: Dr Jaya Dayal\nPerformed by: Varad Salvekar, Hrishabh Kanti\nBackground Score: Ruturaj Bhosle\nAbhang Composition: Keshav Kudale\nLight Design: Sachin Lele\nLights Operation: Prerana\nPoster and Creatives: Robin Patel \nDirector\u2019s Note: \nWhat interested me personally was the question of the creative consciousness of the saint poet Tukaram, the source of his poetry, his metaphysical preoccupations, his social rebellion, his love for his beloved God Vitthal. I was interested in finding a device through which I could approach this text. And then it struck me: what would happen if the writer stepped into his own story? His character has found salvation, what about the writer? How will he? It is an investigation into that search\u2026 A devotee in search of God. A man in search of his brother. A writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nThrough two texts \u2013 D. B Mokashi\u2019s original Anandowari and my text where Tuka meets Vithal and Mokashi enters his own story \u2013 multiple confrontations are imagined. Confrontation between Mokashi (writer) and Kanha (character), confrontation between Tuka (devotee) and Vitthal (God). Creator and creation? One writer (Mokashi) searching for another (Tuka)? And then the question prevails: Who gives meaning to the other? Both depend on each other for meaning. For identity. Can there be a God without a devotee? Can there be a writer without her creation? Each validates the other. And each has the power to cancel each other out. \nBut then what if they exchange roles? Or what if this duality itself is the biggest illusion? And so these two texts came to be juxtaposed, hoping to interpenetrate and illuminate each other. \nOur adaptation of Anandowari reeks of tremendous longing for the absolute and the madness, pain of creative consciousness and its concomitant search for meaning embodied in the existential desperation of the protagonists. \nWith Support From \n \n\u00a0 \n",
