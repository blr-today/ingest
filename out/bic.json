    "description": "Oftentimes, the most powerful revolutions begin in verse. \nWith stirring narratives and emotional melodies, Mukti \u2013 Liberation in Song invites audiences to embark on an introspective journey, guided by the verses of poets who dared to dream beyond boundaries. The programme juxtaposes live performances of classical and folk compositions in multiple languages with immersive narration. Enhanced by a simulcast slideshow that spotlights the rich tapestry of Indian poetry, this event explores the perennial quest for freedom. \nFrom Tyagaraja\u2019s desire to break free from worldly attachments to Akka Mahadevi\u2019s defiance of patriarchal norms, each performance encapsulates a unique facet of liberation. Basavanna and Chokkamela\u2019s verses resonate with resistance against caste barriers, advocating universal equality. Kabir\u2019s timeless words soar with a similar spirit, calling upon souls to shatter dogmatic chains. \nThis evening, we honor the enduring spirit of Mukti and celebrate the poets whose voices envisioned a world where freedom isn\u2019t just a political concept, but a universally human truth. \nSupported by: \n \n",

A good moderator has a point of view and \u2013 like \u2018salt to taste\u2019 in any dish \u2013 makes the conversation deep, engaging and participative.\u00a0Good moderators build context, make delicate \u2013 sometimes pointed \u2013 enquiries, navigate difficult terrains, potential conflicts and uncomfortable truths with grace and humour, all the while maintaining the integrity and forward momentum of the conversation.\u00a0They also assess the temperature and shifting temperament of the room, and strive to be the audience\u2019s representative, in turn challenging and coaxing those they are conversing with. \nIn this interactive workshop participants will explore various tools and techniques that will enable them to learn how to become an effective and critical moderator. Through exercises, group discussions and feedback, the workshop will impart practical knowledge on styles and strategies participants can choose from to suit both their personalities as well as the needs of a particular discussion. Finally, it will also provide tips to build confidence and cope with the last minute butterflies-in-the-stomach that is the worry of anyone who has ever \u2013 or never \u2013 walked onto a stage! \nIf you are keen on building a safe and inclusive space, and respectful and inspiring conversations, if you have an opinion but are interested in engaging with others\u2019, if you are \u2013 or want to be \u2013 moderate in truth, temperate in style and obdurate in quest, then this workshop is for you. \n",

    "description": "When rhythm takes flight and grace stands still, something timeless begins to move. \nOn our next evening of Dual Margam, two powerful classical traditions come together in a rare conversation of contrast and convergence. The soaring, drum-led dynamism of Pung Cholom from Manipur, and the grounded, sculptural flow of Odissi from Odisha. \nTraditionally, in Pung Cholom, dancers become percussionists: leaping, spinning, and drumming in mid-air with ecstatic energy and astonishing control. In contrast, Odissi unfolds in slow, sinuous arcs, where each gesture and every glance evokes poetry, myth, and devotion. \nIn this special performance, the two rhythmic traditions of Pung Cholom and Odissi are interwoven and contrasted: bringing fire to form, and pulse to poetry as the dances come together with complementary aesthetics. \nThe first in a two-part Odissi-Manipuri conversation, this evening unfolds through two male bodies and will be revisited next month through the feminine form. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",

Titled Handlooms\u2014Past, Present and Future, this conversation brings together iconic voices who have shaped, preserved, and championed India\u2019s rich textile heritage. \nFrom policy and preservation to design and storytelling, the panel will explore the layered realities behind India\u2019s handwoven traditions, especially in a time when fast fashion dominates and artisan livelihoods face uncertainty. \nThe discussion features Laila Tyabji, founder of Dastkar and pioneering craft revivalist; Ratna Krishna Kumar, patron of traditional arts and crafts; Nandita Das, actor, director and social advocate with a deep interest in handloom; and Chandra Jain, textile revivalist and presenter of River Weaves : Brocades of Banaras. The session will be moderated by award-winning writer and cultural commentator Shoba Narayan. \nExpect reflection, insight, and real questions: What must change? What must endure? And how can each of us \u2013 designers, buyers, storytellers, citizens, help ensure that India\u2019s handloom story continues to be written? \nThis panel discussion is part of the\u00a0River Weaves: Brocades of Banaras\u00a0exhibition, an immersive experience & exhibition that invites visitors into the world of Banarasi handloom, one of India\u2019s most exquisite and storied textile traditions. Presented by Chandra Jain and designed by Siddhartha Das Studio, the exhibition is a tribute to the artistry, symbolism, and sustainability embedded in every thread of Banaras brocade. \n",

    "description": "130 minutes | Malayalam with English subtitles | 1978 | G Aravindan \nA circus tent rises by the river, and with it a world both real and imagined. \nThampu (The Circus Tent) is a luminous blend of documentary and fiction, capturing the arrival of a travelling circus to a quiet village on the banks of Kerala\u2019s Bharatapuzha river. Featuring real circus performers, local villagers, and a cast of non-actors, the film becomes a portrait of the everyday lives that unfold around a spectacle. \nDirected by G. Aravindan and shot by Shaji N. Karun, Thampu marked the second collaboration between two of Indian cinema\u2019s most visionary artists. Filmed in stark black and white on a modest budget, it is a masterclass in restraint and imagination. Every frame holds the weight of directorial decisions: what is showcased, and what is obscured. \nRecently restored by the Film Heritage Foundation and digitised by the National Film Archive of India, Thampu has been rediscovered by global audiences. From the Cannes Classics to the British Film Institute\u2019s Treasures segment, and most recently at the Festival of 3 Continents in Nantes, its revival is a tribute to Aravindan\u2019s enduring cinematic voice. \nFilmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini will introduce the film and moderate a post-screening Q&A. \nNote:\u00a0This special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G. Aravindan and cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun \u2013 both of whom we remember with great reverence.\u00a0BIC aims to pay homage to the iconic duo, and the Parallel Cinema movement they pioneered, through the screening of two films bound by their unique, shared cinematic vision.

The bus never comes. \nPiravi (The Birth)\u00a0is a quiet, devastating meditation on loss, hope, and the personal toll of political violence. Based on the life of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier, Piravi is an intimate elegy for a missing son and a father\u2019s unyielding prayer. With unforgettable performances from Lakshmi Krishnamoorthy and Archana, the film has earned nearly 30 international awards, standing as a poignant reminder of how political tragedies are always deeply, painfully personal. \nInspired by the real-life story of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier, whose son disappeared during India\u2019s Emergency in 1976 while studying at the Regional Engineering College in Calicut, Piravi captures the slow unraveling of a family consumed by grief. It is a heartrending portrayal of personal loss and the impact of political oppression. \nKarun\u2019s directorial debut film will be introduced by filmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini, who will also moderate the post-screening Q&A. \nNote:\u00a0This special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G.

In this timely and wide-ranging session, Peter Varghese, former Australian Foreign Secretary and High Commissioner to India, offers a perspective shaped by decades of diplomacy and deep engagement with the region. \nHis address will explore the complex forces redefining the Indo-Pacific: from the sharpening rivalry between the US and China, to China\u2019s expanding influence and the evolving policy direction in Washington. The session will also examine how key regional players (India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia) are shaping their own responses to these pressures, and what this means for the broader security of the region. \nAlongside geopolitics, the conversation will turn to trade tensions, economic nationalism, and the slowing pace of globalization; factors that now cast long shadows over our economic future. Can traditional regional institutions hold, or will more agile, interest-based minilateral groups take their place? \nFollowing his presentation, Peter Varghese will converse with Latha Reddy, Nitin Pai, and Ranjan Mathai. The evening concludes with an audience Q&A, inviting reflections on a region that will shape the 21st century. \n",

The main features of the programme are:\n\u2013\u00a0Performances in a variety of spaces, not necessarily a stage\n\u2013\u00a0Usually smaller numbers, in intimate surroundings\n\u2013\u00a0Typically two actors \u2013 even one as sometimes done\n\u2013\u00a0No staging requirements of sets, costumes, lights, etc. Just good performance! \nWhat will not be easily seen about Storytelling Theatre is that it requires a specialized approach to content and scripting and, therefore, a specialized technique in performance. Those who have seen BLT performances such as Robi\u2019s Garden and Shakespeare By Any Other Name will understand this readily. \nStorytelling Theatre in India is a relatively new form that is still evolving. Participants in the workshop will be contributing to its development. \nWho is this workshop for? \nThis workshop is meant for those who are already well into the theatre arts and are committed to future work in either theatre making or performance, but with a special interest in Storytelling Theatre. It is not meant for mere \u201corientation\u201d or armchair exploration.\u00a0It will be a doing workshop, covering such objectives as:\n\u2013 To examine and appreciate different forms of Storytelling\n\u2013 To look at the special needs of storytelling theatre\n\u2013 To explore the unique skill sets needed in the actor for the above \u2013 in body, voice and mind\n\u2013 To make a beginning in creating a community of theatre storytellers, committed to developing the form.\n\u2013 The last objective is significant. It is accepted that there can be a limited amount of coverage in a two-day workshop. We hope to continue as a community of storytelling theatre makers. \nPlease note:\u00a0The workshop will be for a limited number of participants. All interested in the workshop are requested to register early. BIC reserves the right to finalize the list of participants.\u00a0There will be no walk-in registrations at the workshop.\u00a0 \n",

Presented by Chandra Jain and designed by Siddhartha Das Studio, the exhibition is a tribute to the artistry, symbolism, and sustainability embedded in every thread of Banaras brocade. \nFrom shimmering motifs inspired by Mughal gardens and temple carvings, to rare handwoven sarees dyed using natural dyes after a gap of 125 years, River Weaves presents a textured narrative of tradition and revival. It highlights the unseen processes behind each masterpiece, degumming, spinning, dyeing, and weaving, while also centring the voices of the weavers, many of whom have inherited and protected this craft for generations. \nBut this tradition is withering. Fewer artisans are able to sustain the work, and the next generation is stepping away. Through this exhibition, we hope to rekindle awareness and inspire a return to wearing and supporting these textiles, because unless people continue to buy, the craft will not survive. \nRiver Weaves is more than a showcase, it\u2019s a call to action. Every Banarasi brocade is not just fabric, but a living story of skill, memory, and community. \nThe concept and vision for the exhibition were conceived by Chandra Jain, a long-time advocate of India\u2019s crafts and textiles.\u00a0The exhibition has been curated by Chiara Nath and Siddhartha Das of Siddhartha Das Studio, an award-winning, multi-disciplinary practice known for its powerful storytelling of India\u2019s cultural heritage. The studio specializes in museums, interpretation centres, exhibitions, and craft installations. Their design brings together historical depth and contemporary relevance, inviting visitors to engage meaningfully with the legacy of Banaras Brocade. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

Originally launched online in 2022 by ReReeti in partnership with the British Council and Glasgow Life Museums, this exhibition is now being reimagined as a physical, immersive experience. It is especially relevant for young people who have only ever encountered Partition through textbook chapters and distorted narratives. \nCurated by ReReeti, designed by Aditi Dhamija, and in collaboration with the Bangalore International Centre, this exhibition urges participants to deeply feel the emotional weight of forced, mass migration. The digital interactives serve as the core touch point, but the stories extend beyond the screen. Spilling into the physical space as tactile, atmospheric, and visually compelling encounters, visitors navigate through stories of displacement \u2013 stories based on real accounts of families. You will face difficult choices on behalf of characters, driven by fear, survival, and the need to protect their families. \nWhile Partition impacted families across the subcontinent, its realities are often distant in southern India. This exhibition opens space for reflection and conversation, prompting visitors to connect personally with questions of identity, loss, memory, and inter-generational resilience. \nThe hope is to change how future generations choose to carry our history forward. \nPlease note: Kids below age 6 will not be allowed inside the Gallery space. \nClick here to know more about the Panel Discussion. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n\u00a0 \n",

What if classrooms became labs of imagination, not factories of repetition? \nThese are the questions that the Agastya International Foundation set out to answer 25 years ago, by designing a curiosity-driven, experiential learning model that has transformed education across India.

    "description": "Insider accounts from political aides, bureaucrats, and diplomats have long illuminated the workings of power\u2014but even more enigmatic were the lobbyists. Operating in the shadows, often invisible to public scrutiny, they were intimately privy to clandestine negotiations, back-channel discussions, and subtle bureaucratic skirmishes. In his new roman-\u00e0-clef For No Reason At All, Ramjee Chandran shines a light on this hidden world. \nChandran\u2014well\u2011known in Bangalore as a journalist, publisher, and podcaster\u2014has, until now, remained silent about his time as a lobbyist in 1980s New Delhi, a pivotal era just before major economic reforms took hold. \nDrawing from real events, the novel charts the journey of a young lobbyist caught in a high-stakes conflict over silicon metal\u2014a material deemed strategically vital. Central to the drama is Metkem Silicon, which, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, devoted 17 years to developing indigenous silicon metal technology. Yet their efforts collided with a rival scheme spearheaded by the Department of Electronics, which wanted to bypass local innovation and import U.S. technology. \nWhat ensued was a four\u2011year bureaucratic war: media leaks, secret memorandums, and the covert involvement of the Soviets and other intelligence agencies\u2014culminating in a final decision placed in the hands of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. \nSet against the backdrop of Cold War Delhi on the cusp of liberalisation, the novel paints a vivid portrait of a nation\u2014and capital\u2014torn between ideologies and ambitions. The Soviet Union may have vanished, lobbyists have receded from public corridors, and few can claim first\u2011hand knowledge of that era. \nIn Confessions of a Lobbyist, Siddharth Raja\u2014a lawyer, historian, and bibliophile\u2014sits down with Ramjee Chandran to peel back the layers of this story, offering an insider\u2019s glimpse into a world that feels at once distant and disarmingly relevant. \n",

    "description": "It\u2019s here. The climate crisis is no longer a distant warning.\u00a0 \nClimate Change: The Policy, Law, and Practice is a vital intervention. A book that gathers decades of global negotiations, Indian legal battles, and emerging climate jurisprudence into one urgent and accessible narrative. From courtroom precedents to cutting-edge policy, from carbon markets to constitutional rights, it examines how law can both shape and respond to the climate emergency. \nAuthor and legal expert Jay Cheema draws from his experience as Amicus Curiae to the Supreme Court of India in a landmark carbon emissions case. Guiding us through the evolving legal architecture of climate action and accountability, his presentation will be followed by an incisive conversation with an interlocutor to explore the tensions and hopes within the climate discourse. An open Q&A will close the session. \nReshaping landscapes, displacing lives, and challenging our very systems of governance, this crisis can no longer be sidelined. Forests burn where there was once monsoon green, rivers swell as glaciers retreat, and the ancient cycle of India\u2019s six ritus feels increasingly unfamiliar. The chaos predicted by climate scientists in the 50\u2019s is increasingly creeping into our reality.\u00a0 \nBecause the climate crisis is not only legal and political, but deeply personal. \n",

Join Ashutosh Varshney and Mahesh Rangarajan, moderated by Sudhir Krishnaswamy, for a critical conversation on the book\u2019s arguments, and implications, for how we understand populism, democracy, and political modernization in India today. \nThe conversation will centre political scientist Srikrishna Ayyangar\u2019s new book, A Logic of Populism: India and its States (Cambridge University Press, 2025). Drawing from diverse state-level case studies, Ayyangar argues that populists in India operate not merely by claiming to speak for \u2018the people\u2019, but by dividing society in ways that claim to serve a broader common good. Through this lens, populism is not a singular ideology, but a political method. One that adapts itself to India\u2019s democratic context in distinct, often surprising ways. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the discussion. \nTea will be served from 5 PM. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "A poet\u2019s prerogative is to witness life. \nSiddhartha Menon\u2019s poetry belongs to a modern practice, going back to around 1900, of creating poems through spells of intense attention to non-human life for its own sake. This evening will begin with a conversation between Menon and Prashant Keshavmurthy on how two of Menon\u2019s six poem collections \u2013 The Compass Bird (2023) and Lone Pine (2025) \u2013 relate to this modern poetic practice. Together, they\u2019ll trace the lineage of a quiet but radical poetic tradition that resists metaphor, transcends language, and pulls attention. \nWhile the natural world has always been a favourite muse of the human mind, select poets have found powerful anecdotes to draw their readers in. Pushing past the self-centred gaze so familiar to us, the lyrical observations of this style asks us to witness the fascinating creatures with whom we share this world.\u00a0 \nClosing with a Q&A open to the audience, this event promises insights, inspiration, and immersion. \n",

    "description": "At the edge of legend and longing, two women wait for the same god. \nKalatra is a dance-theatre work by Keelaka Dance Company that reimagines the story of Murugan and his two consorts (Valli and Devanai) not as divine footnotes, but as women bound by love, rivalry, and fate. In the classical Hindu tradition, Murugan\u2019s union with both is a symbol of completeness, of sacred balance. But in Sri Lanka\u2019s local poetic lore, a quieter, more human story unfolds. \nThe journey begins in Kataragama, where Murugan is worshipped not just by Hindus, but by Buddhists, Muslims, and indigenous tribes. Each finds a reflection of their own devotion in his form. Here, the story of Valli takes root, even as the shrine of Devanai turns away. Locals say she cannot bear to see her lord walk each night to Valli\u2019s side. \nBlending Bharatanatyam and contemporary dance, Kalatra draws from mythology, regional poetry, and imagined memory. Presented by the Keelaka Dance Company, conceived by Jyotsna Shourie and Aneesha Grover, with music by Daniel B George, OS Arun, and Madstarbase. \nA performance where myth breathes, and devotion speaks! \nIn Collaboration with: \n \n\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Like ink on paper, a dancer on stage brings stories to life through gesture, rhythm, and the quiet intensity of perfection. \nIn this specially curated evening, the National Youth Ballet Company presents a selection of Pas Seuls (solo variations) and ensemble works that celebrate both classic repertoire and fresh interpretation. Ballet, with its rich vocabulary of movement, is a timeless form of storytelling; one that carries emotion, history, and character in every turn and leap. From the mischievous Swanhilda of Copp\u00e9lia to the grace of the Lilac Fairy from Sleeping Beauty, the bold spirit of Sylvia, the charm of the Nutcracker\u2019s Tea Dance, and a fiery Jazz Waltz, each piece invites the audience into a world of layered characters and expressive movement. \nThe evening culminates with excerpts from The Cave of Wonders; a preview of Aladdin The Ballet, the upcoming production by The Lewis Foundation of Classical Ballet. \nThis event is an invitation to witness dedication, beauty, and the enduring power of dance. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n \n",
