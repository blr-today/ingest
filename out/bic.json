    "description": "What is nature?\u00a0Though it is a term used so ubiquitously, its meaning has been debated and questioned, changing with each era. While trees, animals and the planets are considered natural elements, it is the human relationship to nature that concerns us the most. Aren\u2019t humans too part of nature, rather than external to it? What is the relationship between humans and nature? Is it merely utilitarian, or is there hope that can it be something more? \nMusical Ecologies is an exploration of how music and art can answer such questions for us, by showing us how to experience nature as a world of emotion. Hindustani music has a long tradition of celebrating natural beauty and seasons. These compositions capture the subjective human response to nature, locating humans very much inside the natural ecosystem as co-habitants. Perhaps by relating to nature on its own terms rather than from a position of control or exploitation, we can contemplate a symbiotic model of living for the future. \nHindustani vocalist Priya Purushothaman presents bandishes and raags that celebrate the environment and its rich ecosystems, interspersed with commentary addressing these philosophical questions, suggesting a way of bringing together environmental consciousness and music. \nThe session will also include readings and a discussion with Musician, Playwright and Social Justice Worker Rumi Harish. \n\u00a0 \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Humanity stands on the brink of a new era defined by intelligence. Artificial intelligence is evolving at a breakneck pace, transforming not only business and daily life but also politics- both personal and the world\u2019s. \nThis session draws from Juna\u00a0Antonio March\u2019s book Momentum\u00a0that confronts the pivotal challenge of our age- the allure of extraordinary progress, juxtaposed against a world teetering on the edge of chaos, held back by outdated political structures. Momentum\u00a0charts the trajectory of this new world and the path to avoid fatal collapse. \nThis session will shed light on how AI is dramatically reshaping the world by revolutionising various sectors, the challenges it presents,\u00a0how we interact with technology and navigate our environments, how AI is increasingly influencing politics by shaping public discourse, campaign strategies, and policy decisions, thus, becoming\u00a0instrumental in affecting strategic decisions of\u00a0 politics and governance. \nJuna Antonio March will be in conversation with Tanuj Bhojwani. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Kannada | 130 Minutes | For ages 8 years + \nIn Jayant Kaikini\u2019s Kannada play \u2018Jotegiruvanu Chandira,\u2019 based on\u00a0Joseph Stein\u2019s\u00a0classic \u2018Fiddler on the Roof,\u2019 the audience is taken on a heartwarming journey that blends traditional stubbornness with a tender embrace of life\u2019s bigger picture. Set against the backdrop of citizenship and partition, this story is akin to a sweet eye-opener, inviting us to ponder the true meaning of being a citizen. \nAt the heart of the play lies a family in an Indian coastal village during the tumultuous partition era. The wounds and displacements caused by the division of the nation have traveled far, reaching even this remote southern hamlet. Yet, the unique sense of humour and the strong family dynamics that define the village people become the lifeblood of the narrative. \nThe play challenges the notion that citizenship is merely about papers and borders. Instead, it explores the deeper, more complex question of what it means to feel truly at home \u2013 a sentiment that transcends the physical boundaries of a nation. \nThe play\u2019s rich tapestry of characters and their experiences weave a tapestry of resilience, adaptability, and the enduring power of community. As the audience follows the family\u2019s journey, they are confronted with the harsh realities of displacement and the fragility of identity, but also with the profound joy and comfort found in the embrace of a supportive, close-knit society. \nThrough its blend of humour, poignancy, and universal themes, \u2018Jategiruvanu Chandira\u2019 emerges as a powerful testament to the human spirit, reminding us that the true essence of citizenship lies not in documents, but in the sense of belonging and the connections that bind us together, transcending the artificial divisions of the world.

    "description": "Kannada with English Subtitles | 113 Minutes | 1993 \nAfter the death of the father, a family is forced to move from their home in the forest to the city, where they barely scrape by. \nThis month\u2019s film featured in our informal film club is Devara Kaadu\u00a0(1993) \n\u201cDevara Kaadu\u201d is a poignant Indian film that weaves together themes of environmental conservation, family bonds, and the struggle for survival. Directed by Pattabhirama Reddy, this 1993 drama tells the story of Deva, a young man whose life journey takes him from the forests of his childhood to the harsh realities of urban life, and back again to his roots. \nThe narrative begins with tragedy, as Deva and his mother are forced to leave their forest home after his father\u2019s death. In the city, they face the challenges of poverty head-on. While his mother works as a domestic helper, young Deva takes on the role of a rag-picker, scraping together what he can to support their meager existence. As he grows older, Deva advances to pulling a rickshaw, a symbol of his determination to improve their circumstances. \nHowever, the city\u2019s toll on his mother\u2019s health becomes evident. Her dying wish to return to their native place sets in motion a bittersweet journey. Though she doesn\u2019t survive to see their homeland, Deva ensures her final resting place is beside his father\u2019s grave. \nIt\u2019s at this pivotal moment that Deva\u2019s true life\u2019s work begins. Honouring his parents\u2019 wishes and memory, he embarks on a remarkable four-decade mission to reforest the barren land they once called home. Through his tireless efforts, Deva transforms the landscape, creating a lush forest where once there was only abandoned earth. \n\u201cDevara Kaadu\u201d is not just a tale of personal loss and perseverance; it\u2019s a powerful allegory for mankind\u2019s relationship with nature. The film showcases how one individual\u2019s dedication can lead to monumental change, breathing life back into forgotten lands and communities. \nRecognized for its environmental message, \u201cDevara Kaadu\u201d was awarded the National Film Award for Best Film on Environment Conservation/Preservation in 1993, cementing its place as a significant work in Indian cinema. \nCredits: \nDirector: Pattabhirama Reddy\nAssociate Director: Konark Reddy\nStory and Screenplay: Pattabhirama Reddy\nDialogue: Su Ramakantha, C Chandrashekar\nMusic: Konark Reddy\nCinematography: Navroze Contractor\nEditor: Suresh Urs\nArt Direction: G Murthy\nCostume Design: G Murthy\nMakeup: Sharavanan\nSound: V Aravindan, P K Suresh (Dialogues), K S Krishnamurthy (Re-Recording) \nStarring:\nKirthana Kumar, K T Abraham, Kantharaj, Prabhu, Anand, T S Nagabharana, Katte Ramachandra, Suman Ramesh, C Chandrashekar, A R Chandrashekar, Usha Bhandari, Dakshinachar, Abbas Abbalagere, Kantesh, C V Rudrappa, Uma Rudrappa, Indu, Raja Balakrishna, Joseph Katukaran, Chandra, Mutthuraj \nProduced by: Pattabhirama Reddy Productions\nPresented by: The Concerned for Working Children (Bangalore)\nProduction Manager: Kotappa \n\nAbout B\u2022Cinematic \n\nCalling all cinephiles!

    "description": "Many years ago, in Detroit during a chance meeting with Jerry Murad of the Harmonicats, a commitment was made. Sulaiman Jamal met Jerry Murad at a harmonica convention, and he asked Sulaiman to continue playing the chromatic harmonica. He highlighted the versatility and beauty of the small instrument. That was Sulaiman\u2019s motivation and inspiration to continue playing the unique instrument which he had actually put in cold storage. \nWhile Jerry had passed away many years ago, Sulaiman was reminded by a mutual friend that he had not fulfilled Jerry\u2019s request \u2013 This concert is to do just that. \nThe theme of the concert is to cover some of the greatest Broadway and cinema themes, mainly from yesteryear which have warmed our hearts. \nThe evening will include favourites from Phantom of the Opera, The Wizard of Oz, Jesus Christ Superstar, Fiddler on the Roof and more. Not to forget the classics from The Beatles, Leonard Cohen, Simon and Garfunkel, and Big Band and Blues numbers. \nWith a group of extremely talented and accomplished musicians, the evening can\u2019t be anything but memorable. The magic of the Harmonica and an incredible music ensemble awaits you. \nPresented by: \n \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Every day we hear something unusual. A fire here, a flood there, a storm surge, a cloudburst. These events affect all of us, our well-being, our health, our family, our work. Their frequency and intensity are increasing. Fortunately, however, we no longer lack explanations for these events. We know fossil fuels and the destruction of Nature by us humans are the primary reasons for the alarming acceleration in global warming. \nAwareness is the first step towards change, and Rajan Mehta\u2019s\u00a0Backstage Climate\u00a0is an attempt to make you aware of global warming and climate change in a simple and interesting manner. It demystifies this grim reality\u2014the science, the politics and the economics behind climate change. It also gives you a glimpse of the policies, technology and solutions that can help save the planet and ensure our survival. \nGoing slightly beyond mere awareness, the attempt is to help the reader connect the dots and develop a perspective on the reasons, impact and solutions that can help us avoid a climate crisis. \nRajan Mehta will be in conversation with Prem Panicker. The discussion will be followed by a\u00a0Q&A session with the audience. \nPresented by \n \n",

    "description": "Kathak, one of India\u2019s most iconic classical dance forms, has continuously evolved over centuries, shaped by the dynamic interplay of poetry, politics, and cultural shifts. Imperative to its evolution are the poetic narratives and political landscapes that have informed and transformed both its content and form. \nIn this performance, Madhu Nataraj and the Natya STEM Dance Kampni present a space-temporal retelling of Kathak\u2019s rich history. Through an array of rare, vintage, and contemporary choreographies, the dancers weave together the past and the present, allowing historical veracity to coexist with artistic resilience. \nThis unique performance delves into Kathak\u2019s diverse journey across regions and eras, offering an insightful exploration of how artistic expression has both shaped and been shaped by the socio-political contexts of its time. From the courts of ancient kingdoms to the modern stage, the show showcases Kathak\u2019s timeless beauty and enduring adaptability, all while celebrating the dance\u2019s poetic spirit. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "Puertos de Tango (Tango Ports) aims to revisit lesser-known themes of great Uruguayan authors, thus keeping wonderful compositions alive. The project includes a special tribute to Astor Piazzolla and the great Uruguayan poet Horacio Ferrer, evoking much of their creative duo and reinterpreting part of their repertoire inspired by the artists\u2019 homeland, Uruguay. In this kind of cosmopolitan tango without temporal and spatial boundaries, some versions in Italian and French are included, justified in the words of Ram\u00f3n Pelinski (Argentine ethnomusicologist and composer) who describes tango as a \u201cglobal metaphor\u201d: a tango with infinite possibilities, capable of imagining and travelling to other worlds, without fear that \u201cits entire life is yesterday, holding it in its past.\u201d \nNatalia Bolani seeks her own interpretation from her perspective as an actor, resignifying and valuing the chosen texts through contemporary sounds, mainly appealing to the sound of the piano and the bandone\u00f3n, instruments with strong organic and referential connotations in Rio de la Plata culture. \nThe project intends to attract new audiences to this genre, as well as to offer a repertoire not usually enjoyed by those more familiar with the music. Its raison d\u2019\u00eatre is, ultimately, the encounter with the emotions, a meeting where interpretive and sonorous power intermingle in the same waters, in a kind of cathartic ritual through artistic creation. \nPresented by\u00a0the Embassy of Uruguay and MLC Estates LLP \n\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Ardha \u2013 The Incomplete Dream is a solo work born out of a collection of essays contained in the book, Finding Radha by Namita Gokhale and Malashri Lal. Weaving together Bharatanatyam and spoken word, Ardha looks at Radha as the \u2018adhara\u2019 in whom the essence of Krishna is held. Beyond her oft-recognized status as Krishna\u2019s lover and his chosen gopi, Radha is \u2018Hladini Shakti\u2019 \u2013 the potency that is half of Krishna, their spirits engaged in perpetual \u2018Lila Hava\u2019- the exchange of ornaments, attire, and souls. \nCould Radha be an illusion that, through her dhara (flow) of joy and pain in union and separation, symbolizes the yearning for something beyond, a yearning that exists in every human? What happened to Radha after Krishna left Mathura? Why is Krishna celebrated while Radha, is a mere shadow in her aradhana to him? \nCredits:  \n\u2013 Concept, Choreography, Dance, Spoken word: Vidhya Subramanian \n\u2013 Music Composition: Shreya Devnath \n\u2013 Sound track produced at Resound India and mixed and mastered by Sai Shravanam \n\u2013 Musicians: Keerthana Vaidyanathan, Shreya Devnath, Sivaprasad, Sruti Sagar, Sai Shravanam, Manonmani, Vidhya Subramanian \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "What happens when we begin to realise that perhaps what we see isn\u2019t through clear eyes? \nWhat if we not just sense that many lenses exist in this world,\nBut also that each one of us has an endless supply of them. Lenses big and small\nLenses of all kinds\nDifferent lenses for different people\nDifferent lenses for different situations\nLenses Inspired by the learnings and un learnings of our individual and collective journeys. Lenses inspired by the biases and fears we wear as shields. \nAnd what happens when lenses begin to come off\nOne at a time? \nMeri Aenak Se is a journey a part of each one of us is on. A secret quest each human being is on, a quest of love, a quest for a world with that love\nSo one can surrender to it\nWe take these journeys while we travel on roads that are parallel to one another,\nas we live alongside each other\nBut we take these journeys in isolation.\n\nWhat would happen if suddenly, these journeys became aware of one another?\n\n\nAbout The Aahvaan Project \n\n\n\nThe journey of Aahvaan, a musical collective, has been nothing short of an odyssey. Beginning in late 2016, the past two years have been a watershed moment for the group, as they have traversed the length and breadth of the country, performing, conducting workshops, and enriching themselves through the experience. \nThroughout their tours, Aahvaan has continued to refine their musical style, fusing diverse genres and collaborating with like-minded artists to create a sound that they believe is a modern representation of Nirgun. This constant evolution has allowed them to connect with fellow travellers along the way, each encounter contributing to their artistic growth. \nAahvaan\u2019s latest presentation, \u201cMeri Aenak Se,\u201d is an exploration of the differences in perception, attitudes, and actions that shape our individual experiences. It invites the audience to step into the shoes of another, to see the world through their eyes, and to share in their joys and struggles as if they were one\u2019s own. \nThe original songs and stories, lovingly and thoughtfully curated by Vedi and Sumant, are a testament to Aahvaan\u2019s commitment to storytelling. They cherish the opportunity to share their journey with audiences, fostering a deeper understanding and connection between individuals and cultures. \nAahvaan\u2019s story is one of growth, exploration, and the power of music to bridge the gaps between us. Through their performances and workshops, they continue to inspire and captivate audiences, inviting them to embark on a journey of self-discovery and empathy. \n\u00a0 \nSupported by \n \n",

He will talk about deviating from the traditional form of journalistic writing into more creative ones and the crossroads where these forms converge and diverge. The talk will also offer insights into the status of the Hindi media, its role in shaping the Hindi belt polity, and the urgent need to focus on and invest in this media section. \nAshutosh Bhardwaj will be in conversation with\u00a0Kannada author Vasudhendra followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "India, being one of the developing countries in the world, does face many challenges when it comes to taking up specific developmental projects for the benefit of the people. Natural resources management and societal applications are the biggest areas for India where the Government spends lots of funds for the benefit of its people. \nGovernment spendings of public money in many important areas, such as, building rural and urban infrastructure, programs on land & water conservation, agriculture, water, forests, energy and many others to ensure sustainable development of all basic needs of the people, are efforts towards achieving our sustainable developmental goals. This calls for meticulous planning and well-orchestrated implementation and monitoring. \nSpace technology provides many interesting solutions in terms of Earth observation, communication and GNSS based solutions. The presentation brings out specific areas where such solutions are being provided to the Government using space technology so that the goals of development and governance are met amicably. \nThe talk by Prof. Diwakar will be followed by a discussion with Ecologist, Harini Nagendra.
