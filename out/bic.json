    "description": "For Aboubakar Fofana, nature is not a resource, it is divine.\u00a0 \nEvery leaf, every drop of water, every hue of indigo is a manifestation of the sacred. Born in Mali and raised in France, Fofana is a multidisciplinary artist and designer whose work in calligraphy, textiles, and natural dyes, is rooted in reverence for the natural world and its cycles of creation, decay, and renewal. \nIn this conversation, he reflects on indigo as both material and metaphor, a living substance that embodies memory, ecology, and spirituality. Through fermentation and rhythm, his practice becomes meditation: a dialogue between human intention and the intelligence of nature. He will also share insights from his work in Siby, Mali, where he is building a community-led indigo farm that integrates food, medicine, and dye plants into a holistic ecosystem. \nAn invitation to rediscover the sacred in the soil: where art, devotion, and the divine converge in living colour. \nPresented by: \n \n",

Through quiet observation and intimate storytelling, the film reveals both the loss and the resistance that arise when conservation excludes the very people who have lived in harmony with nature for generations. \nWinner of the Best Depiction of the Climate Emergency at Film Southasia 2024, A Flaming Forest has travelled through film festivals and universities worldwide, sparking urgent conversations on what true, inclusive conservation should look like. \nDirected by Salman Javeed, Satya Ambasta, and Vivek Sangwan, the film blends ethnography and cinema to ask: can we protect the forest without silencing its people? \nCredits\nProduction: Srishti Films\nExecutive Producer: Sanjay Barnela\nEditing and Sound Design: Salman Javeed\nCinematography: Sanjay Barnela, Salman Javeed, Vivek Sangwan\nDirector of Research: Nitin Rai\nResearch and Production: Anandi Mehra, Paromita Bathija, Satya Ambasta \nThis performance is part of the larger Coexistence Mela at BIC on Nov 22 and 23.

Odissi, by contrast, is shaped through defined stances and sculpted transitions, where each turn of the body becomes an offering of story and song. \nThis performance brings together two women dancers in the Odissi\u2013Manipuri conversation, setting two vocabularies side by side: one fluid and veiled, the other precise and chiselled. \nThe second in a two-part Odissi\u2013Manipuri dialogue, this evening unfolds through the feminine body, following last month\u2019s exploration by two male dancers. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",

Revealing how diverse voices and dialects carry the same heartfelt spirit, two vibrant ensembles bring these songs to life: Pattalamma Janapada Kala Sangha from Mandya and GK Kala Vedika from North Karnataka.\u00a0 \nThrough live renditions and storytelling, the session explores the social and cultural significance of Shobane, how these songs serve as a collective blessing, a space for women to voice joy, longing, and devotion. The audience will be invited to experience the changing rhythms and tones that mark life\u2019s transitions, from the playful to the profound. \nThe fifth presentation in the BIC Janapada series, this evening is a tribute to the music that has long held Karnataka\u2019s communities together: in rhythm, reverence, and radiant joy. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka\u2019s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression. Through demonstrations, performances, and academic discussions, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Four poets from Bangalore come together for an evening of poetry in English and Hindi, exploring how language moves across geographies, experiences, and ways of seeing. Their poems reveal how words can hold multiple realities, opening up Worlds Within Worlds through translation, memory, and imagination. \nThe event will feature readings from Perennial: The Red River Book of 21st Century Hindi Poetry (Red River, 2025), edited by Sourav Roy and Tuhin Bhowal; So That You Know (HarperCollins, 2025) by Mani Rao; and The Book of Blue (Red River, 2024) by Atreyee Majumder. Together, these books offer distinct yet connected perspectives on how poetry continues to shape and question the world we inhabit. \nThe session will conclude with a conversation among the poets and an audience Q&A. \n",

The \u201cserious\u201d raga invites quiet reflection, bound by structure and emotional gravity, while the \u201clight\u201d raga celebrates freedom by weaving playful turns, folk colours, and spontaneous joy. \nTogether, they create a conversation between depth and delight, discipline and abandon; a meeting point of heart and art. \nIn collaboration with:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Over the past two decades, Bengaluru\u2019s exploding real estate sector and massive infrastructure investments have led to land speculation targeting working-class neighborhoods and agricultural land for development.\u00a0Chronicles of a Global\u00a0City\u00a0turns Bengaluru inside out to examine its \u201cworld-city\u201d transformation that stimulated rapid urbanization and unbounded growth. Moving the spotlight away from the urban elites and the new middle class, the essays in the volume explore how people caught up in the whirlwinds of change in Bengaluru\u2014from construction laborers, street vendors, domestic workers, and platform delivery workers to small-time property brokers, petty landlords, and local politicians\u2014experience, struggle, aspire, invent, strive and speculate to make a livable\u00a0city\u00a0for themselves. \nGrounded in long-term ethnographic research, the volume introduces the idea of \u201cspeculative urbanism\u201d to reveal the complex entanglements of finance, real estate, livelihoods, and ecology in Bengaluru\u2019s unfolding futures. \nThe discussion features contributors to the volume and two discussants, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Who gets to eat what, how, and with whom? \nIn South Asia, food has never been just about sustenance, but rather about hierarchy, belonging, and belief. From caste-based taboos of purity and pollution to colonial notions of civility and hygiene, every meal tells a story of power and exclusion. \nThis session unpacks the politics of the plate: tracing Ambedkar\u2019s critique in Beef, Brahmins, and Broken Men, the Islamic philosophies of fasting and prohibition, and the gendered labour that sustains domestic kitchens. It will also examine how global veganism intersects (and sometimes clashes) with South Asian histories of food, faith, and resistance. \nAn exploration of what it means to eat ethically, communally, and consciously in a world where the simple act of sharing food remains deeply political. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "Beneath the rhythm of drums and the sweep of dance, a quiet plea rises from the marshes, the reeds, and the frog king. \n\nShhh\u2026 Listen! is a powerful, multidisciplinary performance that gives voice to the voiceless: our vanishing wetlands, their unseen creatures, and the communities most affected by their loss. At its heart lies a tale of beauty and loss: a vibrant marshland silenced by pollution and bulldozers, yet still whispering a call to renewal. Through music, movement, and myth, Shhh\u2026 Listen! reminds us that the wetlands are not wastelands, but living, breathing worlds, waiting to be heard again. \nThrough Kattaikkuttu, Parai, Oyilattam, Oppari, and Bharatanatyam, performers from historically marginalised communities embody both the living pulse of nature and the pain of its erasure. Their art, rooted in resilience and reverence, becomes an act of remembrance and protest, linking ecological destruction with social injustice. \nAt once an ecological lament and a deeply human one, Shhh\u2026 Listen! bridges the fates of land and life. A poetic call to listen anew; to the whispers of the earth, the silenced voices of its keepers, and the music that still stirs beneath the mud and rain. \nCredits\nArtistic Director: Sangeeta Isvaran\nScript: Shrilakshmi Sridhar, Sangeeta Isvaran\nLyrics: Thilagavathi Palani\nPerformaned by: The Katradi Youth Dance Theatre \nThis performance is part of the larger Coexistence Mela at BIC on Nov 22 and 23.

    "description": "Sounds From The Library returns for its sixth edition! \nAn intimate evening where conversation and performance intertwine in the cozy, listener-focused space of the BIC library. This hybrid series spotlights emerging voices from the Indian music scene, all past longlisted artists from the Toto Awards for Music. \nFrom the hills of Karbi Anglong, Assam, Chokamkuru Langneh brings his signature blend of alt-rock and indie-pop. Arjun C, from New Delhi, crafts guitar-led synth bops that meld 80s nu-disco, alt-R&B, and synth-pop into playful, heartfelt, and irresistibly groovy tunes. Tying it all together is Jishnu Dasgupta, bassist and manager of Swarathma. A storyteller and performer, Jishnu adds wit, warmth, and rhythm to this intimate evening of music and conversation. \nMore than a gig, Sounds From The Library invites audiences into the creative lives of the artists; offering insight into their inspirations, processes, and personal journeys. With music that moves and conversations that linger, this is a rare chance to experience live performance in its most thoughtful form. \n\nIn collaboration with: \n \n",
