    "description": "Degula |\u00a0Shreema Upadhya | 35 mins \nThe human form is considered sacred across civilizations and religions. Scriptures describe its sanctity and godliness; the significance its protection holds. Just as a shrine constructed with symbolism and care houses the deity, so does the body act as a vessel for our soul. This parallel also manifests itself in the Indian temple, whose structure appears to mirror the human anatomy, in both the physical and metaphysical sense. \nWhy then do we abuse this body, hate it, neglect it, and constantly attempt to alter it to fit into an external mold that it was never meant to conform to? We journey thus through the length of our very being to where the worshipped resides, with an exploration of the body through culture and time to celebrate the beauty of the imperfectly unique over the ideal, the purpose behind the periphery. \nBreath |\u00a0Deepali\u00a0Salil, Sayani Chakraborty | 45 mins \n\u201cBreath is our maadhyam, a conduit for our emotional well being and a spiritual gateway.\u00a0Living in the breath allows us to experience our present and our body completely. It allows healing. \nHave you noticed that emotions and thoughts disturb the rhythm of your breath, leaving it shallow, or reluctant at the bottom of an exhale or top of an inhale? When left unchecked, these thoughts and emotions calcifies into repeated, reactive responses. Meditating and /or regulating our breath opens our awareness, breaking the chain reaction of emotional and thought elaboration.\u00a0We can recognize that our incessant breath is always informing us of our inner world, while simultaneously providing us with the solutions to disturbances in our emotions, thoughts, and physical wellbeing. \nThis incessant breath dances within me and I seek that breath while I dance, and when I dance there are two dancers, one me and one Shiva. When Shiva gradually merges into me and two dancers become one. I become a manifestation of his Ananda Tandava, where everything that moves in this universe is a beautiful dance. \nHe dances, the world dances, I dance and we all become one.\u201d \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Mirrors is a creative fellowship encouraging an artistic exploration of masculinities. The inspiration for the fellowship emerged from \u2018(De)constructions of Masculinities\u2019, a research study which undertook a\u00a0critical review of approaches to programming on masculinity within the development sector. \nThe reflections and challenges shared by various civil society organizations/ unions around masculinity made us feel that there was a need for a more expansive understanding of masculinity, which needs to move beyond merely, reforming the behaviours of boys and men. To this end, we invited 12 individuals from different parts of the country to produce daily ethnographies on how they perceive masculinity in and around them. Given the diversity of social locations, their writings reveal the way in which masculinity is shaped by social differences of caste, gender, sexuality, religion, class and so on.\u00a0The study made us realise that we have only scratched the surface when it comes to engaging with the vast, often messy terrain, of what constitutes masculinity and femininity. \nWe believe artistic practice can offer a way of expressing the silences, frictions, contradictions, suppressions and desires that shape this experience. We put out an open call for applications and received an overwhelming response, across geographies, language, and socio-economic locations. The works you see featured are by the 12 fellows who were selected under the fellowship. \nIn collaboration with \n \n",

They released their debut album Sound of Streets in April\u00a02024. This performance draws an amorphous portrait of the Teesta highway line, capturing the\u00a0rhythm of life and work along the highway. \nLanguage: Nepali | English \nThis event is in collaboration with India Foundation for the Arts (IFA), as part of their\u00a0festival Past Forward: The Pleasure, Purpose and Practice of Arts Research, that celebrates the\u00a0work of over 70 artists in the last 10 years of their Arts Research programme.\n \nSupported by:\n \n",
