    "description": "Indira Gandhi\u2019s catchy slogan in the 1971 general election is usually seen as emblematic of the vacuous populist politics she espoused in the 1970s. This received wisdom, the lecture suggests, overlooks a deep and under-appreciated transformation of the Indian state\u2019s developmental ambitions in this period. \nThe lecture by Srinath Raghavan traces the emergence of a new framework of thinking about poverty and the policy approaches that flowed in its wake. These incipient ideas and programmes were powered by a major change in the financial architecture of the Indian state that took place concurrently. Together, these signaled a far-reaching transformation of the Indian state\u2019s approach to development, that persists to date.\u00a0The talk will be followed by Q&A session with the audience. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Finding a solution to the vexatious Cauvery dispute has been a challenge even to the collective wisdom of veteran politicians, seasoned policy makers, experts, and farmers. At times, it has also tested the strength of India\u2019s federal structure . After bickering among riparian constituents of the Cauvery basin for over a century and exhausting all avenues, the judiciary, finally, had to divide the quantum of water for each of the involved parties. \nIt is against this backdrop that T Ramakrishnan, a journalist who has been with The Hindu for over 30 years, and specialises in water issues, has authored a monograph in English \u2013 Cauvery: A Long Winded Dispute, which has been published by The Hindu Group. \nIn his talk, Ramakrishnan will give an account of how the dispute has evolved over the years, especially after the 1924 Agreement between the Madras Presidency and the Princely state of Mysore. Concerned over challenges facing the river on various fronts, including environmental, he favours collaboration between the two principal riparian States, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. \n",

    "description": "A\u00a0trio of accomplished musicians are coming together for the first time in recital. Bangalore-based baritone Rahul Bharadwaj and Chennai-based countertenor, Subin Mathai are accompanied by Mumbai-based Steinway artist Nadine Crasto on Piano. \nThe program is an exploration of the interaction between text and harmony in Art song. Chance encounters with poems set in distinct styles led to searches for more such instances. This set of juxtapositions could offer insight into how meaning is conveyed in music. Composers cited include Brahms, Schumann and Debussy. \nThe duets in various styles from Schumann to Vaughan Williams offer an opportunity to experience arrangements for baritone and countertenor, an unusual sonority. The piano, especially in the Art song, emerges as a collaborative storyteller in its own right. As the third voice in this narrative, it interprets and amplifies the emotions embedded in the poetry, providing a foundation for the vocalists to soar. \n \nSupported by: \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "This panel discussion is a conversation between two authors who also share a teacher-student relationship. Nivedita Menon will speak on her latest book, Secularism as Misdirection, while Debangana Chatterjee, her student from Jawaharlal Nehru University, will present her first book, Lives of Circumcised and Veiled Women. The intellectual pursuits of two individuals, which converged in classroom discussions once, complete a full circle of knowledge creation. \nThe conversation aims to probe religion and secularism using gender as the focal point.\u00a0Menon\u2019s title alludes to perspectives from the global South and India. In her argument, secularism performs a \u201cmisdirection\u201d as in the performance of a magic trick.\u00a0It simultaneously hypervisiblises women and religion and obscures caste, capitalism, and the non-individuated, non-rational self.  Chatterjee\u2019s work sheds light on the politics of representation and the process of exoticising women\u2019s bodies in knowledge production; presenting the politics which cloaks the \u2018misdirection\u2019. It brings out the intricacies of representational discourses around cultural practices of female circumcision and Islamic veiling. \nThe conversation will be moderated by Rinku Lamba, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "The design of the IIM Bangalore (IIMB) campus has evolved through contributions from multiple architects over time, yet its adaptable built and open spaces seem to have allowed it to develop into a cohesive and integrated entity. The book The Making of a Campus: IIM Bangalore shares how this campus came into being and how it has been experienced over time. Through its pages, the book reveals the thought processes, design philosophies, and the interplay between architecture and community that have contributed to the campus\u2019s continuing appeal and functionality. \nUsing the book as a starting point, the session will explore how a shared design philosophy has imbued the campus with a sense of timelessness. This project, conceived and executed by architects Balkrishna Doshi and Achyut Kanvinde with subsequent additions by Sanjay Mohe & Medappa, stands as a testament to the enduring design. \nThe session will commence with an introduction by the book\u2019s author, Kiran Keswani, followed by insights from Bijoy Ramachandran, who has produced two documentary films on Doshi. Subsequently, architects Sanjay Mohe and Medappa will present their contributions to the campus design, sharing their discoveries, challenges, and outcomes. The event will conclude with a dialogue on \u2018creative collaboration\u2019 among the speakers and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "2022 | 88 mins | English | India \nThe film is about what used to be a little-known event until the 1980s but which has now become the single largest annual pilgrimage in India: The\u00a0Kanwar Yatra. \nThe Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage dedicated to Lord Shiva in which devotees, known as kanwariyas, fill water from the river Ganga and carry it back to their hometowns for libations. \nThe film looks at not just the religious and cultural aspects of the\u00a0Yatra\u00a0but also its socio-economic impact, the environmental issues attached to it (for instance, the state of the Ganga), the sheer maleness of the event, and how the occasion is being used by Hindu right-wing groups to push their majoritarian agenda and the showcase it has become for Hindu nationalism. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with Director, Kunal Vohra. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "The book The Politics of Modern Indian Language Literature examines various works of literature, focusing on prose narrative forms such as novels, short stories, memoirs and plays. It deals with works by 25 different writers in 14 languages including those from the religious minorities, marginalised sections and ethnic groups such as those from Kashmir and Manipur, and also women writers from across India. The thrust of the book is primarily the politics of the writing and the common concerns that surface in the selected works. Since so many languages are covered, the works are studied in English language translation and important are primarily the concerns and attitudes of the writers as they are revealed in\u00a0the translated\u00a0works. \nThe book tries to look beyond the expressed concerns of each writer at covert significations if any. The discussion is expected to shed light on issues pertaining to Indian language literature after 1947, since this is the first book on the subject to scrutinize it in this way. \nThe author MK Raghavendra will be in conversation with Chiranjiv Singh, IAS and N Vidyashankar Jois, both of whom have been highly active culturally in Bengaluru. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n",

    "description": "Since the first humans migrated to present-day India 65,000 years ago, the pravaas hasn\u2019t stopped. \nWhether seeking greener pastures, fleeing oppression, or pursuing economic opportunities, migrants have moved across districts, states and countries. Despite different times, places, and cultures that separate each wave of migration, there is much that is shared in a migrant\u2019s experience. \nPravaas \u2013 A Migrant\u2019s Tale is a musical telling of a migrant\u2019s journey. Whether it\u2019s a Bihari traveling to Chennai, a Rajasthani to Bengaluru, or a Tamilian to Mumbai, the only certainty in their journey\u2014whether it begins with hope or fear\u2014is its unpredictability. \nJoin us in the musical experience of the migrant\u2019s timeless tale featuring songs in Bengali, Sanskrit, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu and more. The performance is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of those who seek new horizons. \n",

    "description": "In the context of dance, Laya refers to the pace of rhythm and movement. It is not only at the foundation of dance, but also at the core of our lives. With time comes movement, growth and change. In that aspect, time or Taal is very integral to art and to life, in general. Time and tempo in dance are expressed through movement, rhythm and a progression of ideas. Laya and Taal go hand in hand, making rhythm the universal language of dance and music across disciplines. \nLaya Ki Kah\u0101ni,\u00a0explores Laya and its various manifestations. The artist showcases traditional complex rhythmic compositions and poetry, weaving stories of how \u2018Laya\u2019 is integrated in our everyday lives. \nMerging the traditional and the contemporary, Kathak exponent Aditi Bhagwat presents rhythmic ideas, modern stories and narratives in\u00a0Laya Ki Kaha\u0304ni- The Universal Language of Rhythm \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "In a rapidly evolving global landscape, the historical bond between India and Russia stands at a crossroads, presenting both challenges and opportunities. This session explores the multifaceted nature of their relationship amidst significant geopolitical shifts. \nHistorically, India and Russia have enjoyed a robust partnership, characterised by deep-rooted ties and mutual cooperation. However, recent global events, such as the rise of China, the conflict in Ukraine, and changing US foreign policies, have introduced new complexities to their strategic interactions. \nEconomically, both nations have benefited from trade and energy collaborations, but sanctions on Russia and India\u2019s economic diversification efforts pose significant challenges. In defense and security, while arms trade and joint military exercises remain strong, India\u2019s growing defense relationships with Western countries add layers of strategic ambiguity.\u00a0Regionally, the dynamics in areas like Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific region influence bilateral relations, necessitating a recalibration of strategies. On the multilateral front, platforms like BRICS and the SCO offer both collaboration and contention. \nThis session seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dilemmas and opportunities in India-Russia relations, offering insights into the future trajectory of this pivotal partnership in a world marked by constant flux. \n",
