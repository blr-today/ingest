    "description": "How does ideology become actionable?\u00a0 \nIn the padippakkam (reading rooms) of Tamil Nadu, ideas spread like wildfire. Pamphlets passed from hand to hand and conversations stretched endlessly. What began as intellectual restlessness soon crystallised into a shared civic consciousness.\u00a0 \nThe Dravidian Pathway traces how this cultural churning transformed into one of India\u2019s most enduring political movements. Vignesh Rajahmani\u2019s study illuminates the Dravidian movement\u2019s sophisticated synthesis of anti-caste thought, aspirations for socio-economic mobility, and an inclusive Dravidian\u2013Tamil identity; an evolution that culminated in the emergence of the electorally formidable DMK. In his account, ideology is never abstract: it is lived, negotiated, and embodied by ordinary people seeking dignity and opportunity. \nIn this discussion, Rajahmani is joined by Dr. Srikrishna Ayyangar and Dr. Atreyee Majumder, to examine the strategies of Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, K. Kamaraj, C.N. Annadurai, and M. Karunanidhi, and consider how their ideas continue to shape Tamil Nadu\u2019s political imagination in an age of rising majoritarianism. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "What does it take to shape a filmmaker? How do you \u2018make\u2019 a Jaya Bachchan or an Adoor Gopalakrishnan?\u00a0 \nRadha Chadha\u2019s new book The Maker of Filmmakers: How Jagat Murari and FTII Changed Indian Cinema Forever takes us through the life and legacy of her father Jagat Murari, and the iconic film school he built. With uncanny consistency, FTII produced top talent: Jaya Bachchan and Shabana Azmi, Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Subhash Ghai, Shatrughan Sinha, Girish Kasaravalli, Mani Kaul, and many other cinema legends. His alumni became the big names of Bollywood, spearheaded the Indian New Wave, kickstarted regional language cinema, and helped usher television into the country. \nIt\u2019s this extraordinary creative legacy that leads to the book\u2019s tantalizing question: Did Jagat Murari have a secret formula? In conversation with author Radha Chadha, Ambassador Talmiz Ahmad, legendary filmmaker Girish Kasaravalli, and iconic cinematographer G.S. Bhaskar, this session will delve into how Jagat Murari and FTII shaped generations of filmmakers \u2013 and how their work transformed Indian cinema into the global powerhouse it is today. Both Radha and Talmiz grew up at FTII, where their fathers served as Principal and Vice Principal. \nThe session will include a montage of student film clips of iconic FTII alumni Jaya Bachchan, Shabana Azmi, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Subhash Ghai, Mani Kaul, and others, as also an excerpt from Girish Kasaravalli\u2019s award-winning student film Avsesh. A Q&A with the audience will be followed by book signings by the author. \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences.

    "description": "A triple bill of Indian classical dance; transforming the negotiations of modern life into electrifying movement. \nPlay Ball brings together three sharply etched Bharatanatyam and Kathak pieces that reimagine modern experience through classical form. Premiered in India to wide acclaim at the Natya Kala Conference in 2019, the production showcases an all-female cast of dancers whose performances move fluidly between playful, tender, and powerfully precise. Conceptualised and choreographed by Nina Rajarani MBE, one of the UK\u2019s leading choreographers, with original scores composed, directed, and sung by Y Yadavan, the evening is lifted further by live music that draws audiences into each world on stage. \nAcross the three works, the central question unfolds: what does it take to play ball?\n\u201cKadala\u2026 Is It Love?\u201d follows a relationship strained by wavering fidelity; \u201cBend It\u2026\u201d transforms the football field into a rhythmic, high-energy dance of rivalry and camaraderie; and \u201cQuick!\u201d turns the corporate arena into a tightly choreographed contest of ambition and urgency: the piece that won Rajarani the 2006 Place Prize, Europe\u2019s largest choreographic award. \nRajarani\u2019s fusion feels both deeply familiar and strikingly new. These works capture the pulse of contemporary life through the language of classical dance, offering an evening where tradition meets the spirited negotiations of the modern world.\u00a0 \nConcept, Choreography and Artistic Direction: Nina Rajarani MBE\nMusic Composition and Direction: Y Yadavan\nLight Engineering: B Charles\nSound Engineering: Shanthosh Kannan\nMultimedia Design: Gaurav Singh Nijjer\nMultimedia Operations: Nikhil Bansal \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "A tradition stays alive not by preservation alone, but by the courage to reimagine. \nThis concert pays homage to the Hindustani classical musicians of the 20th century: artists who honoured an ancient lineage while boldly reshaping it for a changing world. As India awakened to independence, they too evolved with it, expanding melodic possibilities, reimagining rhythm, and infusing contemporary thought into timeless ragas. Legends such as Pt. Dinkar Kaikini, Pt. Kumar Gandharva, Vid. Prabha Atre, Vid. Veena Sahasrabuddhe, Begum Akhtar, and Farida Khanum helped forge a modern, resonant Hindustani idiom whose influence endures today. \nMaahi and Neil revisit this rich inheritance through ragas like Yaman Kalyan, Bihag, Multani, and Bhairavi, alongside select semi-classical pieces. Both artistes will present vocal works. Maahi will be accompanied by Neil on the Appalachian dulcimer, while Neil\u2019s performance will feature Aniket on classical electric guitar. Kaushik will provide the rhythmic accompaniment on tabla for both. \nAn evening to honour the musicians who made this music timeless. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "\nWho is a hero without a villain? \nChoreographer Raghav Handa explores the complexities of power through a deeply physical and theatrical vocabulary. The work unfolds in a world where the familiar slips into the uncanny, creating a charged landscape that both unsettles and mesmerises. Through bold movement, striking imagery, and layered symbolism, Handa probes the dualities we carry within us: strength and fragility, courage and fear, dominance and surrender. \nRather than offering clear answers, Superhero invites audiences to sit with ambiguity. What does it take to stand tall in a fractured world? Can heroism exist without shadow, conflict, or contradiction? And when power transforms from something possessed to something shared, who do we become?\u00a0 \nThis event is in partnership with Attakkalari Centre for Movement Arts.

Drawing from both clinical experience and contemplative traditions, Dr. Bhat charts a path toward reconnecting with our values and rediscovering direction in an increasingly fast-paced world. \nA gentle invitation to pause, understand what\u2019s unfolding within, and realign with what truly matters. \nThe talk will be followed by an audience Q&A. \nPresented by: \nNirvikalpa Integrated Therapy Foundation\nFounded by Dr. Shyam Bhat, the Nirvikalpa Integrated Therapy Foundation blends India\u2019s philosophical and psychological wisdom with modern Western science to create a rigorous, evidence-based therapeutic model grounded in non-duality and transcendence.

    "description": "The Preamble of the Indian Constitution begins with \u201cWe, the people of India,\u201d but do we really know how true that rings?\u00a0 \nIn popular memory, the Constitution often appears as the work of a few eminent figures. Assembling India\u2019s Constitution reveals a more layered story; one in which citizens, communities, labour groups, women\u2019s organisations, and emerging political movements actively influenced constitutional ideas. Across the country, people petitioned, campaigned, debated rights, and pushed the Assembly to consider questions of citizenship, minority protections, gender equality, land reform, labour, and democratic participation. And crucially, the Assembly listened. \nDrawing on years of archival research, authors Ornit Shani and Rohit De illuminate how debates unfolding outside the Constituent Assembly; sometimes in distant or overlooked regions, filtered into its deliberations, shaping decisions that continue to define India\u2019s democracy. They sought to make constitutional history accessible, grounded, and alive, inviting readers to see the Constitution not as a static text but as a living achievement of millions. \nThe authors will offer a short presentation of the book, followed by reflections from panelists Arvind Narrain and Arun Thiruvengadam. The event concludes with an audience Q&A. \n",

Beneath Ananya\u2019s soft-spoken, inward presence lies a lyricism that is unflinchingly honest, tracing how her relationship with herself has evolved over time. \nBuilt with contributions from over forty friends and collaborators across the world, A Junkyard Wonder unfolds as both collective creation and private reckoning. The record is shaped around five core lyrical pieces, held together by three interludes: The Flaw, The Discovery, and The Cure, each marking a pivotal emotional shift. \nIntimate, imperfect, and quietly expansive, this evening offers a mirror into negotiations with identity and becoming.  \nBand:\nAnurag Naidu\nKush Upadhyay\nBrecilla Dsouza\nShashank Das\nShivang Kapadia \nSupported by:\n \n\u00a0 \n",

Drawing on over a decade of global research across countries and contexts, this lecture asks an uncomfortable question: how much potential are we wasting when millions operate far below what they\u2019re truly capable of? \nThrough stories of nations that have successfully built strong pathways to success, we\u2019ll explore the architecture of progress: the schools, networks, policies, and cultural shifts that turn capacity into achievement. This isn\u2019t your average abstract policy talk but rather a conversation to understand the structures that launch young people toward their dreams or leave them stranded. \nWhether you\u2019re an educator, policymaker, parent, or simply someone who cares about untapped potential, this conversation will reshape how you think about development and the futures we\u2019re building together! \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

Each vignette reveals how love moves through vulnerability, desire, frustration, and devotion. \nThis performance features Raghuram Rajagopalan on vocals, Vinay Nagarajan on mridangam, Mathur R. Srinidhi on violin, and Sahana Sridhar leading the Nattuvangam. With a distinguished live ensemble supporting her, Pallavi offers an intimate exploration of love\u2019s many textures.\u00a0 \nAn evening that lingers like a feeling you recognise before you can name. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Two classical forms. Two systems of expression. \nOdissi emphasizes torso isolations, its musicality flowing through sculptural stances. Every line curves inward, contemplative and sensuous. Kuchipudi, shaped by dance-drama traditions, brings brisk footwork, elevation and theatrical precision. Its energy is kinetic, narrative-driven. \nThis Dual Margam reveals how regional lineage and performance tradition shape technique. Presented together, these forms show what makes each dance unique in how they occupy space, interpret rhythm and express meaning.  \nAn evening that showcases the extraordinary breadth of Indian performance traditions on a single stage. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "We inherit more than genes at birth; we inherit environments. \nThis panel turns the spotlight on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD), a growing body of science showing how conditions in the womb and early childhood shape lifelong risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other noncommunicable diseases. As India confronts a deepening NCD crisis, the deeper question this conversation raises is unsettling and urgent: if risk begins before birth, how do we protect a future we cannot yet see?\u00a0 \nThe session will examine why early nutrition, air pollution, toxic exposures, and social environments matter as much as adult lifestyle. Dr Kalpana Balakrishnan will discuss how air and toxic exposures affect health beyond the lungs, while Dr Naveen Ramesh will address how nutrition, social systems, and public health responses come into play. The discussion will be moderated by Dr Ashok Vellodi. \nThis panel discussion invites a rethinking of public health itself, from treatment to prevention, from adulthood to the very start of life.\u00a0A Q&A with the audience will close the session. \n",

    "description": "We can always get by with a little help from our friends! \nBasava, a young boy, discovers this for himself when a search for firewood in the forest turns into an unexpected journey shaped by the gentle magic of helping others. \nTo mark the 20th anniversary of Basava and the Dots of Fire, author Radhika Chadha will do a special reading of her much-beloved tale. First published by Tulika Books in 2005 and now in its seventh reprint, the book has become a steady favourite among parents, reviewers and young readers alike. Celebrated for its warm narrative of kindness and friendship, as well as illustrations that make every page feel like artwork, it continues to be recommended as a standout picture book two decades after its debut. \nJoin us for a joyful session that revisits a story whose sparks of wonder and empathy glow brightly long after it is read. \nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins, not with a ticket, but with opening a book.
