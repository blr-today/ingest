    "description": "An Advance Medical Directive (AMD) (usually misunderstood as a Living Will) recognizes the right of a person to choose the nature of medical treatment that he/she would like to be withheld. It is an extension of the principle of the right to die with dignity. An AMD is a person\u2019s advanced exercise of autonomy on the subject of the level of medical intervention they intend to accept on their own body at a time when they may not be able to express their views. The objective and intent of an AMD are to convey a person\u2019s medical care preferences if they lose their ability to make decisions. \nIn March 2018, the Supreme Court of India, in a landmark judgement, recognized the right of a terminally ill person to execute an Advance Medical Directive. AMD helps in protecting basic human autonomy, while also shedding light on the concept of dignity in death. However, it is still a new concept in India and early last year the Supreme Court modified its guidelines for the execution of the Living Will. \nThis session by Mr. Shiv Kumar will delve into the Advanced Medical Directive and will examine the ingredients of an AMD, its legal nuances, how and when it can be made, and its consequences. It will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience and enable a discussion on the barriers that\u00a0impact the efficacy of the AMD. \nIn collaboration with Silver Talkies, a social enterprise focused on making active ageing a desirable and viable goal for older adults:\n \n",

Practice for AFA is understood more in the form of an atelier or a work-shop which is known for a certain way of doing things, approach to questions, craft, and other related qualities. Like most good ateliers, the focus is to produce ideas for good architecture and the method and modality of putting these ideas forward has been the physical model. \nAFA was established in 2011 by Ajay Sonar and Monali Patil in Nashik. AFA has won several awards, including the Archdaily\u2019s 2021 New Practices. Their work has been exhibited at Time Space Existence in Venice in 2023. Most recently AFA has been featured in \u2018Architectures of transition: Emergent practices in South Asia\u2019 published by Harvard GSD. \nThe exhibition will be inaugurated by Sanjay Mohe which will be followed by presentations and a panel discussion. \nPresented by:\n \n",

    "description": "90 minutes | English and Hindi | Mature Content for Ages 16+ \nTrigger Warnings: Suicide & Self Harm \nA two-actor black comedy about life, death, and everything in between. A successful female executive is ready to commit suicide by jumping off a roof when a male cab driver saves her. \nThis sets the stage for a collision between two completely opposite worlds, personalities,\ncircumstances, beliefs, and perspectives. Despite their contrasting socio-economic classes, backgrounds, and lifestyles, this unusual encounter leads to a night of pure and simple human connection. \nWill the man be able to truly save her, or will she be back to jump again? \nThe play explores the themes of suicide, depression, loneliness, happiness, love, having or not having a purpose in life, and ultimately death, creating an emotionally complex and thought-provoking experience for the audience. Jump delves into the human psyche, showcasing the struggles, challenges, and aspirations of two very different individuals who would never meet in normal circumstances but find a unique connection in the most unexpected of places and in their shared\nhumanity. \nDirector\u2019s Note \nApart from being an actor and director, I\u2019m also a mountaineer. I was in an advanced mountaineering course trying to summit a Himalayan mountain in October 2022. An avalanche came, and we lost 29 people out of a batch of 53 people. I somehow survived the incident and escaped death. The incident changed me, my core beliefs, and my perspective on living life. For the first time, I felt depressed and tried therapy. The incident left me with a lot of questions. WHO recently declared loneliness a \u2018global public health concern\u2019. In India, 1 in every 5 individuals suffers from some form of mental health illness, and over 2.6 lakh cases of suicide occur in a year. \nGiven these alarming numbers, considering and addressing mental health is still at a very early stage in India. In a post-pandemic world, the alarming rise in suicide, depression, and loneliness rates around the world shows that our pursuit of success and materialistic goals doesn\u2019t lead us to genuine happiness and fulfilment. In the world of social media, because of personal, sociological, political, and geographical reasons, we feel disconnected more than ever before. We often witness instances where seemingly successful and happy individuals suddenly take their own lives. In spite of the number of self-help books, motivational speakers, and influencers preaching about finding life\u2019s purpose, a significant portion of us are just trying to survive. \nOur individual perspectives play a significant role in shaping our lives. We tend to surround ourselves with like-minded people who share similar perspectives. We believe that our own perspective is the\nultimate and only valid one. If we look closely enough, all the conflicts in the world are just a clash of different and opposing perspectives. \nThe essence of Jump lies in the meeting of these two contrasting characters, identities, perspectives, lifestyles, and worlds within a highly unusual situation. \nAbout Collective Madness\nEvery project for us is an attempt to find a unique connection with our audience around the ideas we believe in. Collective Madness Studios, established in 2004, is a platform for anyone who believes that theatre is a practicing art form and provides a space for those who are passionately attached to theatre.

    "description": "Discussions surrounding China and India\u2019s relationship remain urgent and crucial due to their geopolitical significance, economic interdependence, and potential for conflict. As two of the world\u2019s most populous nations and emerging global powers, their interactions shape regional stability and have far-reaching implications for international relations. With ongoing territorial disputes, trade tensions, and differing strategic interests, understanding and managing their relationship is vital for fostering cooperation, averting conflicts, and navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing world order. \nExploring themes from his book Beyond Binaries: The World of India and China based on his writings on India, China and their often-tumultuous relationship, Shastri Ramachandaran unravels a succinct history of how ties between the two Asian neighbours have evolved over the 15 years from 2008\u20132022 and the internal and bilateral compulsions that shaped them. The book makes the reader aware about the strategic thinking that went into each move and counter-move by the two nations that are often at odds with each other, as they are at present. It is an attempt to deepen understanding of the recent history of Sino-Indian relations and, as the title suggests, look at India-China relations without putting it in the category of good or bad. \nIn this session, author Shastri Ramachandran will be in conversation with Manoj Kewalramani taking the listener beyond the binaries in which perceptions of India and China, their relationship and their role on the world stage is trapped. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "In the era of electoral bonds, the costs of political corruption demand scrutiny. Today\u2019s corruption differs vastly from that of a decade or two ago, altering its associated consequences. \nThe captive coal block allocation scandal entrenched oligarchy by favoring select families, while in states like Punjab, corruption consolidates power within a single family, depriving the state of revenue. Presently, India witnesses a surge in a rent-sharing model, akin to a mafia state, where government support disproportionately benefits chosen firms. This breakdown in the citizen-party social contract prompts reporter M Rajshekhar to analyze its origins and effects. \nAbout Narayan Dutt:\nMr Narayan Dutt was a Hindi journalist. He retired as the Features Editor of PTI Hindi division. He was earlier Editor of Navaneet, a Hindi digest, for many years. He was highly regarded by his peers and received honours such as the Sri Ganesh Shanker Vidhyarthi Puraskar bestowed by the President of India, and an Honorary D. Lit by Makhanlal Chaturvedi Rashtriya Patrakarita evam Sanchar Vishwavidyalay, Bhopal. His date of birth is 17 February 1929.

    "description": "This talk draws from Matthias Mahlmann\u2019s recent critically acclaimed book, Mind and Rights: The history, law and psychology of Human Rights published in open access mode by Cambridge University Press in February 2023.\u00a0 The talk critically examines the growth of the concept of human rights, its roots in history and current human rights theories. It scrutinizes in particular the myth of the Western origin of the idea of human rights by highlighting the many roots of human rights in different cultures, including within the Global South and indigenous cultures. \nA particular goal of the talk is to engage with the so-called cognitive revolution and to investigate the relationship between human cognition and human rights.\u00a0 The talk will argue that insights gained from modern theories of the mind can deepen our understanding of the foundation of human rights. The talk also seeks to answer the question whether the current attacks on democracy can be countered through the use of human rights and its underlying political ethics of egalitarian dignity. Finally, the talk will contend that the pursuit of the human rights idea, with its achievements and tragic failures, is key to understanding what kind of beings humans are. Such self-knowledge is crucial in times in which the human species has put its own survival at risk. \nA conversation between the author, Matthias Mahlmann, and the discussant, Sudhir Krishnaswamy, will be followed by a moderated Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations, the wealth-worth billions in today\u2019s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change \u2013 the emotional and the rational \u2013 and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change\u2014something prevalent in today\u2019s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away.\u00a0The authors will share their insight\u00a0on how it\u2019s imperative to draw lessons from the past, navigate the present, and prepare for the future. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Two years of Covid\u00a0witnessed\u00a0the world going digital in a big way. The analogue era\u2019s cultural movements like film societies too underwent major changes. Many used digital platforms to see and discuss films in their quest towards building a better film culture. \nAfter starting as the only forum for savouring world film classics in 1940s Mumbai, today the film society movement is finding itself in the midst of a complete digital makeover after two decades of struggling with digital formats from VHS tapes to OTT. Will these changes help them achieve their original goal of developing a group of film connoisseurs and professionals who will carry on the mantle of meaningful films? To know the future one needs to understand the history and its dynamics in full measure. \nBased on the book Celluloid to Digital: India\u2019s Film Society Movement by V K Cherian, this session will examine the future course of the Indian film society movement, which nourished the \u2018New Wave\u2019 in Indian films from 1970 and has been an anchor for all the meaningful films in the country. \n",

    "description": "35 mins |\u00a0Kannada, English with English Subtitles | India \nHonavar, a coastal town mostly famous for pre-wedding shoots and great scenic routes, a community full of men and women connected to fishing, have been coming together to save the nesting grounds of the Schedule one species Olive Ridley Sea Turtles. The privatisation plans for the beach would lead to the nesting grounds being ruined thus the death of the next generation of sea turtles in the region. This is a heartwarming story of how humans bond with nature and also come together to protect it. \nIn 2010, the Karnataka government identified a site for a proposed port on an estuary of the Sharavathi River in the town of Honnavar in Uttara Kannada district. Since then, local residents of villages such as Tonka 1 and 2, which are located on this sandspit of land known as Kasarkod have been protesting against the construction of the proposed port. Fisherfolk inhabit these picturesque seaside villages whose beaches are also a crucial Olive Ridley turtle nesting site. The residents and environmentalists state that the port would destroy this crucial turtle nesting site in coastal Karnataka. The annual nesting patterns of the Olive Ridley turtles are closely followed by the local fishing community and a pooja is also conducted when the hatchlings head to the sea. \nLocals also contend that the port would destroy their livelihood as it would have an impact on fishing. As it is, the dry fishing industry which used the land now taken over by the port authorities, has already stopped functioning. Another concern cited by environmentalists is that the estuary is situated on an unstable piece of land that is prone to erosion which would make it unusable for a port. Activists also claim that the building of a port would also mean the laying of a four-lane road that passes through these villages which are a breach of Coastal Regulation Zone norms. The fisherfolk\u2019s opposition to the port has also led to instances over the past few years when protestors have been arrested by the district authorities. While their protests so far have not been successful, villagers have vowed to continue their battle till all the legal routes have been exhausted. \nThe screening of the documentary will be followed by\u00a0a panel discussion with the filmmaker, Vikas Badiger, Sandeep Hegde of the Honavar Foundation and fisherman, Rajesh Govind Tandel, moderated by journalist, Vikhar Ahmad. A\u00a0Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "In this illustrated lecture, Pepita Seth presents her decades of work on Theyyams published in her recent book, In God\u2019s Mirror: The Theyyams of Malabar. The word \u2018Theyyam\u2019 is a corruption of \u2018daiva\u2019, meaning, quite simply, God. Theyyam is an act of worship that brings the deities down from heaven to be among their devotees. The practitioners of Theyyam perform specific rituals and dance to express their joy at seeing their devotees, while the last stages of their manifestation involve them in blessing, healing, exorcising, answering questions and maintaining the link between humanity and the divine. While the process is an internal one that obliterates the practitioner\u2019s human persona, on an external level his face is transformed by intricate make-up and his body fantastically costumed. There are Theyyams for Gods and Goddesses, warrior heroes, wronged women, ghosts, spirits, tigers, snakes and even a crocodile; there are also a few Muslim Theyyams (performed by Hindus). A Theyyakkaran must be able to sing, dance, play the chenda, bless, exorcise and be proficient in kalaripayattu, Kerala\u2019s martial art form since it is used in the rituals of the warrior heroes. Pepita Seth\u2019s decades-long association with Theyyam\u2019s practitioners gave her unprecedented access to their unique culture. In God\u2019s Mirror: The Theyyams of Malabar is the culmination, in her words and photographs, of her commitment to this extraordinary subject. \nPepita Seth writes: \u201cIn God\u2019s Mirror is the outcome of Theyyam\u2019s practitioners suggesting I do a book about them. This was in order to establish that Theyyam is a ritual act during which devotees seek the blessings, and even the help, of the elaborately costumed deities. This was to dispense with the outside world always referring to Theyyam as a dance or a performance when in fact it is a sacred ritual in which men belonging to certain families have the \u2018right\u2019 to \u2018carry\u2019 a deity. Their only condition was that I stayed with them in order to know and understand their lives, respect their multiple skills and realise what was important to them.\u201d\u00a0 \n\u201cAlthough I was born in the UK and trained as a film editor, it was the chance discovery of my soldier great-grandfather\u2019s diary documenting his regiment\u2019s 1857 march from Calcutta to Lucknow that took me to India. Yet despite going there in 1970 to retrace their long march, I finally found another India in Kerala. And it was there that I eventually settled and began photographing and writing about the region\u2019s unique culture.\u201d \n",
