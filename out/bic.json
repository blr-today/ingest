    "description": "You\u2019ve received the call. The scam artist trying to get your information. Perhaps you fell for it, perhaps you knew better. In either case, it becomes a story to tell over coffee. \nBut who are the people on the other end of line? \nIn her new book, Scamlands, journalist\u00a0Snidha Poonam explores\u00a0the vast fraud economies stretching from small-town India to global scam hubs.\u00a0Nuanced, detailed and above all, personal, Poonam reports on the many lives that run parallel to our own.\u00a0Tracing the supply chains of fraud, she reveals an economy that\u2019s both ruthlessly efficient and heartbreakingly human. \nIn this talk, she is joined by columnist Aakar Patel to explore the themes of the book. They will examine how scam economies thrive in the gaps of inequality, why trust is collapsing faster than we can rebuild it, and what it means when fraud becomes a viable career path for an entire generation. The session ends with an audience Q&A. \nThere are no easy answers, but you\u2019ll know more when that unknown number calls again. \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "How do we teach children to hold difference without fracturing? \nAs worldviews polarize globally, education becomes critical terrain for cultivating resilience, communicating values, and building social connectedness among the youth of today. Professor Arniika Kuusisto, leading scholar of early childhood education at the University of Helsinki, presents empirical findings from Finland exploring this urgent challenge. \nThis talk examines educational approaches that equip children to navigate difference constructively. Rather than erasure, Kuusisto focuses on developing capacities for genuine engagement across divides. In increasingly pluralistic societies, the question extends beyond tolerance: how do we foster peer communities where diversity becomes source of strength rather than fragmentation? \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "We have forgotten how to be citizens of our cities. \nWalk through any Indian metropolis and witness a peculiar contradiction: millions inhabit these spaces, yet relate to them only as consumers demanding services. Grievances fragment predictably: the affluent lobby for metro lines while informal settlements fight for sanitation. Each sees the city as a provider that has failed them specifically. \nThis transactional relationship reveals something deeper. Unlike villages steeped in cultural memory or monuments heavy with civilizational pride, the contemporary Indian city exists in our imagination as politically neutral backdrop; a space for commerce and commute, stripped of meaning beyond utility. Without empowered local governance in our collective memory, we cannot envision what urban citizenship might demand. \nThis talk outlines a strategy for civic activism that reimagines the city as living system, shaping who we become through daily encounters. It argues we must ask radical questions. Not merely what services we need, but what kind of city allows dignity, creativity, joy. What connections between citizens create genuine community? What relationship between citizen and state honors our full humanity? \nThe struggle for better governance is simultaneously a struggle to define what kind of people we wish to be\u2014together. \n",

    "description": "James Payne never set out to become a YouTube sensation. He simply wanted to make art history accessible, stumbling into fame with over two million subscribers along the way. But perhaps that\u2019s precisely the point. \n\u201cIn a world of noise and distraction,\u201d Payne says, \u201cgreat art slows us down. It demands attention, reflection, and interpretation. It doesn\u2019t exist to give us easy answers\u2014but it does give us better questions.\u201d \nIn this illustrated talk, Payne brings his signature storytelling and striking visuals to explore celebrated artworks not as distant masterpieces, but as creations shaped by real people, real pressures, real ambitions. Through visual analysis, historical context, and human stories, he reveals how art intersects with power, class, money, religion, politics, and everyday life. No academic jargon. No dense theory. Just essential questions: Why was this made? What did it mean then? Why does it matter now? \nThroughout the talk, Payne encourages and guides the audience to slow down and really look. Details often missed in galleries are brought into focus, helping viewers understand how artists guide the eye, create meaning, and communicate emotion. As much as it is about learning facts, the talk is about learning how to look. \nThis is art history as it should be: open, democratic, relevant. Payne will be signing copies of his book after the session. \n",

    "description": "This recital presents J.S. Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations, BWV 988, performed by pianist Eun Seong Hong. The programme invites the audience into an evening of focused listening and reflection, exploring how a single musical idea can unfold into a rich and expansive journey. Presented in India by Eun Seong Hong for the first time, this performance offers a space where structure, balance, and contemplation resonate naturally across cultures. \nThe Goldberg Variations form a small universe built with astonishing perfection: thirty variations framed by an opening and closing aria, all sustained by a single, unchanging bass line. Across its thirty-two movements, the work unfolds like a hidden architecture in time\u2014at once rigorous and deeply expressive. For the performer, this music is not only a technical or structural challenge, but an inward journey, where each note embodies order, reflection, and a sense of profound balance. \n\u00a0 \nImage Credit \nThumbnail and Poster: Johann Sebastian Bach (aged 61) in a portrait by Elias Gottlob Haussmann (1695-1774), the second version of his 1746 canvas, bequeathed to Bach-Archiv Leipzig by William H Scheide (Princeton, New Jersey).

In telling the story of a single family from a small village in Karnataka, it implements language in its multilingual capacity, thus enabling the reader\u2019s sensibility to percolate society at different levels. Thus, Kannada coexists comfortably within the English novel and enriches the reading experience, not with novelty but realism. The story begins in pre-independent India and while staying true to the arc of a family\u2019s fortunes, it grapples with the complexities of caste and colonialism. It paints the landscape of rural and urban life of a bygone era, ending in the 1970s. \nThe session will conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \n",

Set against recent judicial directions and everyday urban realities, the film moves beyond polarised debates to explore the moral, legal, and governance dimensions of the issue. Through voices from animal welfare practitioners, veterinarians, lawyers, municipal actors, adopters, and citizens, Menace\u00a0traces the shift from historical practices of dog culling to the Animal Birth Control (ABC) framework, while questioning why humane policies often fail in implementation. \nThe screening will be followed by a moderated conversation bringing together perspectives from law, animal welfare, and civic practice. This programme invites audiences to engage with complexity, contradiction, and ethical choice: opening space for reflection on how cities negotiate care and safety without resorting to cruelty or neglect. \nThe screening will be followed by an interaction with the filmmaker. \n",

    "description": "What if a simple strip of green could catalyse profound transformation? \nOur cities bear the scars of a fractured relationship with the natural world: ecosystems dismantled for private gain, communities pushed to the periphery, public space increasingly territorialised. We find ourselves inhabiting environments which, by design, deny the fundamental truth that human life remains inextricably woven into the larger fabric of nature. However, there exists a compelling pathway toward restoration, one that challenges the very hierarchies defining contemporary urbanism. \nThis talk explores linear parks as a democratic intervention in citymaking: longitudinal green corridors that transcend boundaries of caste, class, religion and geography, weaving through urban fabric to create equitable, accessible commons. Drawing upon a groundbreaking movement in Mumbai, PK Das and Harini Nagendra will examine both the promise and complexities of implementation\u2014the successes, the shortcomings, and the lessons learned\u2014inviting us to reimagine how strategic greening can advance social justice, spatial equity, and environmental regeneration simultaneously. \nThis evening promises a conversation that sparks new possibilities for building cities which honour our interdependence with each other and with the natural world. \nThis session is part of the\u00a0Let\u2019s Talk Climate Change\u00a0Talk series. \nPresented by:\n \n",
