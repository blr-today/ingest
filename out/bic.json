    "description": "Over 30 Lakh Women and Children are reported to be involved in sex trafficking in India, with lakhs being forced into the industry every year, some of whom are as young as five years of age. \nThe eviction of women from a red-light district was the spark that lit Prajwala (literally, \u2018the eternal flame\u2019) in 1996. In the years since, the organisation has rescued 28,600 victims of sex slavery, rehabilitated 26,900 survivors, prevented 18,000 children from entering the sex trade, worked to create awareness on the harms of sex trafficking and sex buying, and litigated both to convict traffickers and to demand victim-centric policies from the state. Working with governments, the administration and police, Prajwala has helped thousands of women and children build new lives in the aftermath of sustained abuse. \nI Am What I Am\u00a0is the story of Prajwala\u2019s journey and that of its charismatic, fiery founder,\u00a0Sunitha\u00a0Krishnan. In this powerful, moving memoir,\u00a0Sunitha\u00a0writes about her personal struggles as a child survivor of sexual assault, her unwavering determination to confront sex trafficking in India, the colossal odds stacked up against her mission and her unfaltering belief in a higher power to keep her steady in her fight. \nSunitha\u2019s story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of one individual to ignite change in the face of overwhelming darkness. \nIn this session, Author and Activist Sunitha Krishnan will be in conversation with Poet, Author, Podcaster & Speaker Mohua Chinappa with readings by Geeta Menon,\u00a0Bhavana Chiranjay and\u00a0Kripa Sukumaran followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nPresented by:\n \n",

    "description": "Since the first humans migrated to present-day India 65,000 years ago, the pravaas hasn\u2019t stopped. \nWhether seeking greener pastures, fleeing oppression, or pursuing economic opportunities, migrants have moved across districts, states and countries. Despite different times, places, and cultures that separate each wave of migration, there is much that is shared in a migrant\u2019s experience. \nPravaas \u2013 A Migrant\u2019s Tale is a musical telling of a migrant\u2019s journey. Whether it\u2019s a Bihari traveling to Chennai, a Rajasthani to Bengaluru, or a Tamilian to Mumbai, the only certainty in their journey\u2014whether it begins with hope or fear\u2014is its unpredictability. \nJoin us in the musical experience of the migrant\u2019s timeless tale featuring songs in Bengali, Sanskrit, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu and more. The performance is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of those who seek new horizons. \n",

    "description": "Carbon has been an invisible protagonist on the celluloid screen for a while now. Our lives are saturated with carbon, and the screen reflects its presence everywhere. Though unseen, carbon\u2019s influence permeates our lives and finds reflection in countless stories on the big screen. This festival invites you on a journey from the barren grounds of an e-waste dump yard to the magical forests of the Western Ghats. We will showcase a distinctive collection of cinematic narratives centered on the theme of carbon and bring to life stories that span generations, reflecting both the past and the ever-evolving present. These stories of ambition, resilience, and perseverance will offer a deeper understanding of carbon and films, shedding light on the transformative power of carbon. \nThe festival strives to create an immersive environment where visitors can deeply interact with these ideas through various films and discussions. We are offering a wide array of films spanning different languages, including German, English, French, and Hindi, and genres, from documentary features and narrative features to experimental shorts and animated shorts. Filmmakers and scholars have been encouraged to create a colorful, interactive space that encourages people of all ages to consider carbon\u2019s critical role in our lives and the global ecosystem. \nFestival Schedule:\u00a0Download the full schedule here. \nDay 1 | 6 July | Saturday | 10:00 am \u2013 6:00 pm \n10:00 am \u2013 10:05 am:\u00a0Opening address by SGB team \n10:05 am \u2013 11:40 am: All that Breathes\nDocumentary Feature | Hindi with English Subtitles | India | Shaunak Sen\nAs legions of birds fall from New Delhi\u2019s skies and the city smoulders with social unrest, two brothers race to save one of the casualties: a majestic black kite, a bird of prey essential to their city\u2019s ecosystem. \n11:40 am \u2013 12:30 pm:\u00a0Discussion with Shaunak Sen,\u00a0Garima Bhatia and Ravi Chellam \n12:30 pm \u2013 1:11 pm: Ocean Mud Pickle\nDocumentary Feature | Oriya\u00a0with English Subtitles | India | Paribartana Mohanty\nThe abandoned village of Satabhaya, often submerged by natural disasters and rising sea levels, is a place of memory and speculation.

    "description": "This panel discussion is a conversation between two authors who also share a teacher-student relationship. Nivedita Menon will speak on her latest book, Secularism as Misdirection, while Debangana Chatterjee, her student from Jawaharlal Nehru University, will present her first book, Lives of Circumcised and Veiled Women. The intellectual pursuits of two individuals, which converged in classroom discussions once, complete a full circle of knowledge creation. \nThe conversation aims to probe religion and secularism using gender as the focal point.\u00a0Menon\u2019s title alludes to perspectives from the global South and India. In her argument, secularism performs a \u201cmisdirection\u201d as in the performance of a magic trick.\u00a0It simultaneously hypervisiblises women and religion and obscures caste, capitalism, and the non-individuated, non-rational self.  Chatterjee\u2019s work sheds light on the politics of representation and the process of exoticising women\u2019s bodies in knowledge production; presenting the politics which cloaks the \u2018misdirection\u2019. It brings out the intricacies of representational discourses around cultural practices of female circumcision and Islamic veiling. \nThe conversation will be moderated by Rinku Lamba, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Taking the once idyllic \u201cgarden city\u201d of Bangalore in southern India as its point of departure, Jisha Menon\u2019s book,\u00a0Brutal Beauty: Aesthetics and Aspiration in Urban India\u00a0explores how artists across India engage with urban transformations. The book conveys the affective life of the city through multiple aesthetic projects that express a range of urban feelings, including aspiration, panic, and obsolescence. As developers and policymakers remodel the city through tumultuous construction projects, urban beautification, privatization, and other templated features of \u201cworld\u2011class cities,\u201d urban citizens are also changing\u2014transformed by nostalgia, narcissism, shame, and the spaces where they dwell and work. \nSketching out scenes of urban aspiration and its dark underbelly, Menon delineates the creative and destructive potential of India\u2019s lurch into contemporary capitalism, uncovering the interconnectedness of local and global power structures as well as art\u2019s capacity to absorb and critique liberalization\u2019s discontents. She argues that neoliberalism isn\u2019t just an economic, social, and political phenomenon; neoliberalism is also a profoundly aesthetic project. \nA talk by Jisha Menon will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Kannada | 90 minutes | Suitable for Ages 16+\u00a0 \nThe play is an ode to queer love. It is a meditation on the values of empathy and dialogue as powerful agents to bring estranged minds together. The narrative traverses through moments of passion, anger, sadness, and love in its raw human element. The characters attempt to interrogate, understand, and acknowledge each other, and in this process, unveil the universality of all emotions as being the same, irrespective of gender and orientation. The play tries to deconstruct and lay open the psychological and emotional baggage of the characters who are but symbols of the divided humanity that we are today. An interfaith gay couple and the mother of one of the characters venture on a journey of understanding one another rather light-heartedly through uncomfortable conversations, only to explore depths which they never knew or imagined would be possible to unearth. \n\n\n\n\nPlaywright/Director\u2019s Note: \nWith the drastic change in the political discourse the world has witnessed in the last few years, one cannot but notice the drastic emergence of an undeniable divide within humanity. There are two segments that appear to be in stark contrast, constantly struggling and fighting with each other. There is a constant othering and exclusion of minorities by the majority in power. During the pandemic, the apathy by the political class at large was glaringly visible and we witnessed in full display the class disparity that envelops our nation. The Hindu \u2013 Muslim rhetoric was constantly fed to us through public discourse and hate was offered as a staple diet for even those who refused to be part of it. \nThe artist felt compelled to speak up, believing that love is the only antidote to the vehement poison of hate. They hence decided to write and direct this play that features the love story of a gay couple hailing from the Hindu and Muslim communities. Diversity cannot be celebrated without the intersectionality that makes for the complex mix of the society we are. The play intends to hold the mirror to the microaggressions and biases that consume us all through humor and emotional storytelling. \nWith music, love, and humor, the play tries to unravel the demons of Islamophobia and homophobia in us all. It celebrates the value of empathetic dialogue and honest communication in eradicating hate. Amma mattu Suhail is a tender story of love, acceptance, and possibilities. \nThe artist is a classical musician, writer, and theatre practitioner, and their arts practice is always an amalgamation of these elements. They create out of necessity! Having grown up queer and gender fluid, they struggled to find representation in the Kannada arts scene and were disappointed. They tried to fit in and adapt to the arts \u201cas is\u201d but eventually found it suffocating and had to carve out their own path and create what they wanted to engage with. They strive to bring marginalized voices to the fore and their stories or creations always aim to question and break patriarchal stereotypes and conditioning. Their search is always to find fluidity. Just like their characters either in the plays they have written or in the dance-based compositions they have created, which always traverse through the non-binary nature of gender identity or sexuality, the art they create yearns to find fluidity in form and content. They break the structure and form using non-linear narratives, democratic \u2013 secular emotional indulgences, and fluid emotional paradigms. They attempt to convey the grotesque bizarreness of our social existence with humor and the humorous, funny realities that define us through the macabre. \nThey always like to begin with an uncomfortable space and establish familiarity with the unfamiliar. Most importantly, they want their art to be accessible to all class and caste sections of society. They often find it very difficult to mold their form in a way that does not \u201cother\u201d an audience which has no access to learning arts appreciation or delving into abstraction. While they try to abstain from dumbing down their audience, they make it a priority to make their arts inclusive. Having been in circles where art is created and consumed in the same vicious elitist spaces and circles, they yearn to connect to a larger canvas. \nHaving written, produced, and directed three plays, their exploration has always yearned to find that fluidity between sound and silence, prose and poetry, body and realism. They aim to tell more queer stories which are embraced by the mainstream and more mainstream stories which make the queer community feel that they are \u201cseen\u201d. Whilst they are cognizant of the brutal grays that marginalized voices live in, they believe we need more positive representation of these marginalized characters. Their younger queer self wanted to watch happy endings and stories of hope and not just suicide and tragedies. They work only on stories which are fictional retellings of lived experiences and also for these stories to be specifically told in Kannada. Regional languages have the power to automatically place these stories in a certain space while also making sure to remove them from only English-speaking elite spaces. They strive to create work which opens itself to a more vulnerable audience who need to hear, get uncomfortable, and feel ignited towards a spirit of inquiry through these stories. \nThey will be glad if their art is also entertaining but they will never be okay if it is not activism. \nCredits: \nPlaywright \u2013 Direction \u2013 Music : Karthik Hebbar\nCast: Dr Seetha Kote, B V Shrunga, Arun D T\nLighting: M G Naveen\nProduction Manager: Murali Sreeram\nSubtitles Execution: Chethana Ramesh Srivatsa\nBackstage: Vishak Bharadwaj and Soumya Dixit\nProduced by Dheemahi Theatre \nDheemahi Theatre was born out of the need to create a safe space for new voices. We are a space for the \u201coutsiders\u201d. We have come together to tell stories that have been oppressed and suppressed in other majoritarian spaces. Empathy and humanity are the main focuses of all the work that we create. We as a team thrive on celebrating diversity and secular narratives by exploring and devising new techniques for facilitating these stories. We work around minimalist production setups and maximal internal processes. With a passion for storytelling that transcends boundaries, we strive to create a stage that reflects the kaleidoscope of human experiences. Our productions are more than performances; they are a canvas of shared narratives that resonate with the richness of our collective journey. We aspire to weave together tales that inspire, provoke thought, and unite us in the magic of the theatre. \nSupported by: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "In a rapidly evolving global landscape, the historical bond between India and Russia stands at a crossroads, presenting both challenges and opportunities. This session explores the multifaceted nature of their relationship amidst significant geopolitical shifts. \nHistorically, India and Russia have enjoyed a robust partnership, characterised by deep-rooted ties and mutual cooperation. However, recent global events, such as the rise of China, the conflict in Ukraine, and changing US foreign policies, have introduced new complexities to their strategic interactions. \nEconomically, both nations have benefited from trade and energy collaborations, but sanctions on Russia and India\u2019s economic diversification efforts pose significant challenges. In defense and security, while arms trade and joint military exercises remain strong, India\u2019s growing defense relationships with Western countries add layers of strategic ambiguity.\u00a0Regionally, the dynamics in areas like Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific region influence bilateral relations, necessitating a recalibration of strategies. On the multilateral front, platforms like BRICS and the SCO offer both collaboration and contention. \nThis session seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dilemmas and opportunities in India-Russia relations, offering insights into the future trajectory of this pivotal partnership in a world marked by constant flux. \n",

Contractor\u2019s collection of photographs of Jazz musicians is now with the Smithsonian Museum. This exhibition features a selection from over 20,000 images taken over 60 years, many of which have not been previously exhibited. This retrospective reflects Navroze Contractor\u2019s empathetic gaze and his ability to capture the perfect photographic \u2018moment\u2019. The curators will be present at the opening. \nCelebrating Navroze Contractor | Auditorium | Friday, 5 July | 6:30 pm\nThe inauguration and walkthrough of the exhibition will be followed by the\u00a0Release of the book, Photography Strictly Prohibited.\u00a0Tributes by Sanjiv Shah, Arshia Sattar and Rajesh Nair will be followed by a screening of Jharu Katha (2010), a 64-minute documentary film photographed and directed by Navroze Contractor. \nJharu Katha | 64 mins | 2010 | Documentary\nDrawing on extensive fieldwork in remote corners of rural Rajasthan and the\u00a0by-lanes of Jodhpur city, this documentary film on the broom, directed by\u00a0Navroze Contractor, engages in conversation with a wide spectrum of broom-makers. Their struggle for livelihood is intersected with different stories\u00a0of the broom provided by women and ritual attendants of shrines, traders,\u00a0municipal sweepers and garbage collectors. Through the counterpoint of\u00a0their voices, the film covers wide ground in opening the contradictory values\u00a0and belief-systems of the broom. \nSteeped in the realities of caste, the broom is both a source of livelihood for\u00a0millions of people and the repository of traditional knowledge. Even so, it\u00a0stigmatises entire communities through its associations with pollution and\u00a0untouchability. Highlighting the humiliation and robust survival of India\u2019s\u00a0most downtrodden caste groups, whose hopes are at once catalyzed and\u00a0complicated by the politics of reservations, Jharu Katha works towards a\u00a0larger envisioning of waste in urban India. Bleak and terrifying, this vision\u00a0questions the endurance of the broom and its capacity to reinvent itself in a\u00a0ceaseless process of change \nCamera/ Direction: Navroze Contractor\nResearch/ Script: Rustom Bharucha\nEditor: Monisha Baldawa\nAssociate Director: Madan Meena\nProducer: Yugantar \n\u0926\u0941\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e | Duvidha | 82 mins | 1973 | Hindi with English Subtitles\nBased on a Rajasthani folktale retold by Vijayadan Detha, Duvidha is about a merchant\u2019s son, whose relationship with his young bride, Lachhi is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her, resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband. \nAt its core,\u00a0Duvidha\u00a0is a metaphysical exploration of love, desire, and the complexities of human relationships. The ghost\u2019s obsession with Lachhi and his subsequent impersonation of her husband raise profound questions about identity, fidelity, and the nature of love itself. The film invites the viewer to ponder the depths of human longing and the lengths to which one might go to satisfy that longing. \n",
