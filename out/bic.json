The Courtesan Project\u00a0has become one of the most successful dance revival movements in today\u2019s time. Giving a voice to the women and 100s of years of creative contribution to theatre, cinema and performing arts. \nThis performance is an exploration of the gender dynamics within the arts, unveiling the pivotal influence of women performers \u2013 the enigmatic Tawaifs and Baijis \u2013 of North India from the 16th to the 20th century. The performance is set as an intimate mehfil performance of how the Tawaifs would perform in yesteryears. Their music, their stories, their dance enacted by a single performer. \nThis is a bold statement that is needed to finally accord respect for the performance art of the Tawaif, to go beyond the drawing room sniggers and laughter associated with the word Tawaif, and to finally acknowledge their role in history. \nSupported by: \n \n",

The central idea of this photo-series is that during migration of people across geographies, the objects of love and necessity undergo the arduous ordeal, and that these, bearing the patina of age, create a desire to develop an understanding that personal histories are not isolated from the political selves. \nThe technique of cyanotypes, which is used to print the archival maps for\u00a0A Home in the Constant Flux: A Call to the Verb Memory\u00a0metamorphoses into a metaphor of capriciousness \u2013 endured by refugees. As the cartographic lines, in various shades of blue and white, overlap the digital images of the objects, they gesture at the fluidity of the memory only to find itself resistant to the burden of confinement around the refugees. The aesthetic of distortion \u2013 in the form of borders, the viscosity of the blues and whites, and the ballet of letters \u2013 epitomises the inevitability of embracing impermanence as one of the few constants in a life on the move. The element of distortion serves as a bridge between abstract and representation to encourage the viewer to navigate and map the photo series in order to question the boundaries of perception. \nThe panel discussion on the second day of the event will\u00a0delve into the influence of visual representation on refugee narratives, particularly in light of the surge of imagery overpowering the social and print media in recent years. This influx frequently drowns out the individual voices of refugees, maintaining stereotypical visual stereotypes that confine visual language of that of a destitute \u2018other\u2019. Furthermore, the conversation will confront the inherent tendency to marginalize migrants through photography, highlighting the disparity between mainstream portrayals and the more empathetic and authentic depictions found in the research-based project A Home in the Constant Flux: A Call to the Verb Memory. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n\u00a0 \n",

In\u00a0her debut book\u00a0Code Dependent, shortlisted for the inaugural Women\u2019s Prize for Non-fiction 2024, Madhumita Murgia shows how automated systems are reshaping our lives all over the world, from technology that marks children as future criminals, to an app that is helping to\u00a0offer medical\u00a0diagnoses to a remote tribal community. \nBy highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley, Madhumita explores the impact of this often-exploitative technology on individuals, communities, and our wider society. \nVidushi Marda, a lawyer and researcher, specialises in examining the socio-legal ramifications of data-driven technologies. Her research centers on technology regulation, asymmetric power dynamics, and fundamental rights. Through her endeavors, she collaborates with governments, corporations, and technical communities to promote social justice. \nTogether, they will discuss and unpack\u00a0how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency, and shatter our illusion of free will. AI has already infiltrated our day-to-day, through language-generating chatbots like ChatGPT and social media. But it\u2019s also affecting us in more insidious ways.

    "description": "Urdu and Hindi | 60 mins | Suitable for all ages \nKaafi is a dance theatre production that explores the multifaceted nature of blindness, both physical and metaphorical, through the lens of the character Gandhari from the Indian epic, Mahabharata. The performance uses the form of Bharathanatyam to delve into themes of ideals and examples, conformity, oppression, the roles assigned to a woman, and the consequences of our choices. Kaafi\u00a0contextualises evocative political poetry to narrate the story in the nostalgic memory of Gandhari, her absurd choices, and examines the unseen forces that dictated it. The performance imagines and weaves an intimate tale of her reasons and feelings. A haunting voice that cursed her to perpetual darkness; shackled by the multiple roles of a daughter, wife, mother, and queen, that competed and tore her apart; her relationship with her only kin; her participation and perpetrating of the oppression and violence and an obscured vision of what her life could have been. \nKaafi becomes a mirror reflecting the universal struggle of every woman across time and space. It explores the perpetual tension between aspiration and reality that is predestined for every woman; aspiring to be ideal but perennially falling short\u2014forever insufficient, yet infinitely compelling. Through a combination of dance, symbolism, and internal monologues, the performance invites the audience to reflect on how we navigate the intricacies of our existence, condition of our life and the act of seeing, constantly tugging at the personal question and political state of affairs. \nArtists and Collaborators\u00a0 \nEnsemble \u2013 Adithi, Karuna, Smitha, Keerthana, Krutika,\nChoreography-\u00a0Priyanka Chandrasekhar\nLanguage \u2013 Urdu and Hindi\nStyle of dance \u2013 Bharathanatyam\nMusic production \u2013 Dheeraj Baneerjee\nAssistance in composition \u2013 Karuna Kirtivasan and Arvind Sridhar\nVocals and voice\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Deepthi Baskar\nVocal and voice support \u2013 Karuna Kirtivasan and Talin Subbaraya\nLights \u2013\u00a0Arvind Sridhar\nText \u2013\u00a0Poetry by\u00a0Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Akhtar Sheerani,\u00a0Excerpts from Kartika Nair\u2019s \u2013\u00a0Until\u00a0the Lions\nCreatives, photos and film \u2013 Arvind Sridhar \n",

    "description": "A new cinema movement emerged in India in the late 1960s with a proposition for artistic cinema not influenced by any considerations other than creative and aesthetic. The promise of this movement, known variously as \u201cIndian New Wave\u201d, \u201cNew Cinema\u201d or \u201cParallel Cinema\u201d was that conscientious filmmakers will make cinema which will bear the distinct stamp of the creative artist and not that of a studio. In form and aesthetics, the new wave aimed to reject the forms and values of commercial cinema which relied on the stars, the gaudy sets, many irrelevant musical sequences and melodrama. This movement attracted many young artists who went on to become well-known auteurs. Indian new wave\u2019s body of work, spanning close to three decades, charted a new course in cinema aesthetics with its zealous attempts to experiment with the language of cinema. At the same time, the new wave auteurs\u2019 steadfast political commitment resulted in a critical examination of the complexities of India\u2019s socio-political realities. \nIt is important to point out that there was no formal process or a formally run operation for this movement. Although the initial impetus to the movement came from the loans provided by the Film Finance Corporation, the passion to make artistic cinema, fuelled by the newly trained filmmakers from the Film and Television Institute of India, spread to different parts of the country. \nIn the Kannada language, serendipitously, the first artistic attempt to break free from reigning commercial filmmaking practices came in 1970 when Pattabhirama Reddy produced and directed Samskara\u00a0\u2013 at approximately the same time when the Film Finance Corporation was funding what are considered as the first three films of the Indian new wave: Uski Roti, Ankur\u00a0and Sara Aakash. Samskara\u2019s success was followed by a few other experiments by filmmakers such as Girish Karnad, N Lakshminarayan and BV Karanth. \nBut the one auteur who went on to make some of the most influential and groundbreaking films and put Kannada cinema on the world map was Girish Kasaravalli. \nGirish Kasaravalli graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India in 1975, and his first film as a Director was Ghatashraddha (1977). In the last 47 years since, Girish\u2019s body of work \u2013 17 feature films and one television series \u2013 has critically engaged with the social, political, ideological, philosophical and environmental concerns of the Kannada society and, in a larger sense, of India. Kasaravalli\u2019s films have won him four Golden Lotuses (National Award for best feature film from the Government of India), a Padma Shri and many other awards and recognitions in film festivals across the world. \nToday, when we have access to a variety of content at our fingertips, it is essential to engage with the work of Girish Kasaravalli and learn his remarkable mastery of the formal, aesthetic and thematic aspects of filmmaking and understand his contributions to film art.. \nIn this retrospective of Girish Kasaravalli, we screen five of his films and also have conversations with him and other collaborators after each screening. \n\n\n\nEvent\u00a0\nDate\u00a0\nTime\u00a0\n\n\nIntroduction and Context Setting\nSaturday, May 4\n2:30 \u2013 2:45 pm\n\n\nGhatashraddha (The Ritual) \n108 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 1977\nSaturday, May 4\n2:45 \u2013 4:45 pm\n\n\nGirish Kasaravalli in conversation with Basav Biradar\nSaturday, May 4\n5:30 \u2013 6:30 pm\n\n\nThaayi Saheba \n119 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 1997\nSaturday, May 4\n7:00 \u2013 9:00 pm\n\n\nIntroduction and Context Setting\u200b\nSunday, May 5\n10:30 \u2013 11:00 am\n\n\nGulabi Talkies\u00a0 \n118 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2008\nSunday, May 5\n11:00- 1:00 pm\n\n\nKoormavatara \n115 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2011\nSunday, May 5\n2:30 \u2013 4:45 pm\n\n\nGirish Kasaravalli in conversation with Nikhila H\nSunday, May 5\n5:30 \u2013 6:30 pm\n\n\nKanasemba Kudareyeneri \n105 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2010\nSunday, May 5\n6:45 \u2013 9:00 pm\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \nB-Cinematic \nCalling all cinephiles!

In due course, these new technologies made long-distance travel and communication widely accessible and affordable. In a parallel development, the introduction of limited representation in legislatures in the 1890s added urgency to tap the potential trans-local identities enumerated in the decennial censuses beginning in 1871-72. \nIn view of these developments, local communities, in particular, castes, tapped new technologies to connect with kindred groups across the country and combine to form pan-Indian communities. Post offices allowed members of these aggregate groupings to correspond with each other, while railways enabled them to meet periodically and devise strategies to capture a share in legislatures, educational institutions and public employment proportionate to their census population. Drawing upon philatelic material covering a century, the exhibition highlights the role of the postal system in this new politics. \nThe exhibition is divided into two broad parts that bring together correspondence and publications of several caste-based community organisations and individuals from across the country and the philatelic output of the post-colonial state. \nProf Gopal Guru will inaugurate the exhibition and deliver the inaugural address on May 31, 6:45 pm. He will offer his comments on the exhibition and locate the images in the larger politics of visual culture. \nA Panel Discussion with\u00a0Prof. Satish Deshapnde, a distinguished social scientist who has made seminal contributions to our understanding of caste in independent India, Vaishna Roy,\u00a0Editor-in-Chief, Frontline magazine and Vikas Kumar, Curator of the exhibit, will take place on 2 June, 11:30 am. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

Her first gramophone recording, Ayyo Koyyoda at age 8, ignited her lifelong love affair with folk music. She was a trailblazer who introduced folk songs on a concert platform when she was 11. Encouraged by the overwhelming response she started giving full length folk concerts along with her sister, Vinjamuri Seetha Devi. Popularly known as the Vinjamuri Sisters, they became a phenomenon that took the music world by storm.\u00a0 \nAnasuya started composing music for her uncle,\u00a0Devulapalli Krishna Sastri when she was 9 and became a sought-after music composer. She was multi-talented and excelled in music of every genre but folk music remained her passion. She dedicated her life to popularising and propagating traditional and folk songs. She bequeathed an invaluable legacy to posterity by categorising her vast collection into 7 volumes and publishing them along with lyrics and music notations. At the age of 80, Anasuya became a writer and published 4 books including her autobiography Asamana Anasuya, at the age of 94.\u00a0 \nThe film screening will be followed by a Q&A with the director. \n",

    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations, the wealth-worth billions in today\u2019s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change \u2013 the emotional and the rational \u2013 and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change\u2014something prevalent in today\u2019s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away.\u00a0The authors will share their insight\u00a0on how it\u2019s imperative to draw lessons from the past, navigate the present, and prepare for the future.

    "description": "In Bangalore, the dynamic interplay between urban forests, lakes, and groundwater exemplifies both the challenges and opportunities of managing natural resources in a rapidly growing metropolis. \nUrban forests in Bangalore, including iconic green spaces like Lalbagh and Cubbon Park, serve as vital lungs for the city, offering respite from the urban bustle and enhancing air quality. These wooded areas not only provide recreational opportunities but also support biodiversity conservation efforts, hosting a rich array of flora and fauna amidst the urban sprawl. However, the sustainability of Bangalore\u2019s urban forests faces threats from encroachment, pollution, and inadequate management practices, highlighting the need for concerted conservation efforts and community engagement to safeguard these green havens. \nSimilarly, Bangalore\u2019s numerous lakes, once the pride of the city, now grapple with pollution, encroachment, and diminishing water levels. From iconic water bodies like Ulsoor Lake to smaller neighborhood ponds, these lakes play critical roles in replenishing groundwater, supporting biodiversity, and providing recreational spaces for residents. Efforts to rejuvenate Bangalore\u2019s lakes, such as the rejuvenation of Bellandur and Varthur Lakes, underscore the importance of holistic approaches that address water quality, ecological restoration, and community participation. \nGroundwater, a lifeline for Bangalore\u2019s burgeoning population, faces sustainability challenges due to rapid urbanization, unchecked extraction, and contamination. The city\u2019s reliance on groundwater for drinking water, industrial, and agricultural needs underscores the urgency of adopting efficient water management practices, promoting rainwater harvesting, and curbing pollution to safeguard this precious resource. Initiatives like the \u201cRecharge Bengaluru\u201d campaign aim to replenish groundwater levels by restoring traditional water harvesting structures and enhancing infiltration of rainwater into the aquifer. \nThis panel will discuss the nexus of urban forests, lakes, and groundwater in Bangalore which underscores the complex relationship between urbanisation, natural resource management, and environmental sustainability. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nThis session will be in Kannada and English. \n",
