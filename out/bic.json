    "description": "This talk based on the book, Sovereigns of the Sea. Omani ambition in the age of Empire, views the Indian Ocean as an important political space where both Asian and Western imperial aspirations were articulated in the long nineteenth century. Putting the micro-optic on the Omani Sultans, rather than on European powers, it questions the idea that the Ocean became an uncontested British lake in the age of Empire. It shows how the Sultans made the most of Europeans who made a bee line to the Western Indian Ocean hungry for slaves, cloves, and ivory. They leveraged themselves to European economic concerns and politics, but remained heeled in their own cultural tradition. Many of them reached out to Indian financiers and merchants and articulated clearly their political ambitions. The talk forefronts these Asian imperial ambitions in the Ocean with important implications for the writing of global histories. \nAbout Prof. Satish Chandra \nProf. Satish Chandra (1922 \u2013 2017) was a leading authority on Medieval Indian History. \nIn a career spanning nearly 40 years, Prof. Chandra taught history at Allahabad University, Aligarh Muslim University, Delhi University, Rajasthan University, and finally the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where along with S. Gopal, Bipin Chandra and Romila Thapar he co-founded the Centre for Historical Studies. \nIn between, from 1972 to 1980 he was first Vice Chairman and then the Chairman of the University Grants Commission. \nIn 1985, along with intellectuals like Prof. Nurul Hasan and marine biologist Dr. Zahoor Qasim, he founded the Society for Indian Ocean Studies which, among other activities, brings out the quarterly Journal for Indian Ocean Studies. \nSon of Sir Sita Ram, India\u2019s first High Commissioner to Pakistan (1947-48), Prof. Chandra has, along with some other JNU historians, been said to have been a \u2018left leaning historian\u2019 who espoused the Marxist approach to history, and one whose early experiences helped bridge the intellectual gap in interpreting medieval Indian history and modern times. \n",

The series is designed to be informative, constructive, and entertaining, while also serving as a trigger for local community action. Its objective is to bridge the gap between policy, practice, and public discourse on urban governance challenges, and to catalyse citizen and policymaker engagement towards systemic solutions. \nThe inaugural session will examine: \u201cCan the GBG Act deliver for Bengaluru?\u201d. Enacted in 2025, the GBG Act is a landmark legislation intended to strengthen Bengaluru\u2019s governance. This session will assess whether the Act can deliver on its promise and what it means for the future of the city. \nThe session will open with a context presentation on the Greater Bengaluru Governance Act through a City-Systems Assessment delivered by VR Vachana, Associate Director of Policy at Janaagraha and the Jana Urban Space Foundation. This will lead into a panel discussion on whether the Act can deliver for Bengaluru, featuring Tejasvi Surya, Member of Parliament for Bengaluru South; Rizwan Arshad, Member of the Legislative Assembly for Shivajinagar and Chair of the Joint Select Committee on the Greater Bengaluru Governance Bill, 2024; V Ravichandar, Member of the Brand Bengaluru Committee; and VR Vachana.

    "description": "Hailed by CBC Music as one of Canada\u2019s finest young musicians, pianist\u00a0Tony Yike Yang\u00a0first captured international attention at just sixteen, when he became the youngest-ever laureate of the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. Since then, he has appeared in some of the world\u2019s leading concert halls, from Carnegie Hall and the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre to the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, performing with major orchestras including the Cleveland Orchestra, Warsaw Philharmonic, and Orchestre M\u00e9tropolitain. \nThis evening, he presents a programme that\u00a0traces a sweeping arc through the Romantic imagination. Scriabin\u2019s early Preludes open the program alongside his rarely heard Fantasy in B minor. Liszt follows with two contrasting masterpieces: the intimate Sonetto 104 del Petrarca, and the dazzling Mephisto Waltz No. 1, one of Liszt\u2019s most iconic showpieces. The program culminates in Chopin\u2019s Sonata in B minor. Together, these works highlight the Romantic piano\u2019s full expressive range, brought to life by Tony Yike Yang\u2019s artistry. \n \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Shared roots, divergent paths: listen as tradition and expression entwine! \nSamyoga brings together Hindustani and Carnatic music in a rare exploration of sound, emotion, and tradition. Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal), the performance celebrates both the shared ancestry and the distinctive aesthetics of these classical systems. \nTraversing genres from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotion of Bhakti Sangeet and the lyrical beauty of Thumri and Jawali, each piece highlights how the two traditions converse, diverge, and find harmony. Beyond their mastery as performers, Radhika and Manasi are accomplished researchers, bringing deep theoretical understanding and insight into the evolution, structure, and nuances of Indian music. Through a seamless blend of narration and performance, Samyoga transforms listening into discovery, revealing connections and contrasts that are rarely experienced together. \nA morning of sound, story, and subtle interplay, offering a unique chance to see these two traditions in dialogue. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "When the curtain is removed we see Sugreeva sitting in a mood of deep sorrow and dejection. Sugreeva expresses through hand gestures and facial expression his agonies and his hardships on living alone in a solitary wood. \nSugreeva, for fear of his elder brother Bali, has taken refuge in the Malyavan Mountain. Hounded out of his palace, Sugreeva bemoans his sad lot, living alone in the forest facing the rigours of nature. He sees around him in the forest, a reflection of his own mental state. \u201cMy good God, will my miseries never end? Exposed to the sun, drenched by the rains, shivering in the cold and open to the winds, I live in the forest. Would I ever see a normal comfortable life? He decides to take a leaf and tried to go deep into the issue. First he sees that there is no Friend but there is foe. At that time, he sees a deer running away frightened hearing a hunter\u2019s bow. On taking shelter in a cave, it is frightened to see a lion in it. When he takes up the leaf and looks a second time, he sees Friend and foe. In another angle, he sees a snake hiding in a hole fearing Garuda flying in the sky. Then, Hanuman comes and allies with him. Looking a third time, he sees that he has Friend but there is no foe. In a direction, a peacock dances seeing the dark clouds and a forest fire starts. Later he sees that it rains and the fire ends. Then, seeing Rama and Lakshmana on the banks of the river Pamba, he asks Hanuman, Please go and find the truth behind it and kindly bring them here and make them join hands with me. Sugreeva sees Hanuman returning with Rama & Lakshmana .Here, with the fire as witness, the scene of Sugreeva making friends with Rama is acted out. Together with Rama, Lakshmana, and Hanuman, Sugreeva returns to Kishkindha and boldly challenges Bali to battle \nOn the Stage:\nSugreeva: Nepathya Sreehari Chakyar\nMizhavu: Kalamandalam Manikandan, Nepathya Jiensh\nEdakka: Kalanilayam Rajan\nThalam: Dr. Indu G.\nMake-up: Kalamandalam Satheesan\nTroupe: Nepathya, Moozhikkulam \nThis is the seventh edition of the \u2018All For Dance\u2019 series presented by Kalavaahini in association with BIC curated by Malavika Sarukkai.

    "description": "In a world where we often connect with Lord Shiva through music, dance, and celebration, the concept of\u00a0Murta Maheswara\u00a0offers a deeper understanding of this deity. It is a journey to find the essence of Shiva as a carefree, uninhibited, and truthful force within ourselves, rather than through rigid doctrine. \nMurta Maheswara is explored through three key aspects of Shiva\u2019s nature: \nPashupati:\u00a0This highlights Shiva as the\u00a0lord of all creatures, a figure revered since ancient times. The seals of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro depict him surrounded by animals who trust him completely, showing his connection to all beings\u2014fierce and gentle alike. \nShiva-Shakti:\u00a0This story explores the union of Shiva and Shakti. Shiva represents the\u00a0passive, foundational energy, while Shakti is the\u00a0active, creative force. Their cosmic union is a symbol of harmony and regeneration, a sacred bond that is mirrored in the union of man and woman. \nDhwani-Pratidhwani:\u00a0This concept reveals the origin of sound through Shiva\u2019s cosmic dance. When Shiva strikes his\u00a0damaru, he creates\u00a0Dhwani, the primordial sound. This sound then echoes throughout the cosmos as\u00a0Pratidwani, the manifestation of all audible sound. This illustrates that every sound we hear is part of the divine dance of Nataraja. \nSupported by; \n \n",

    "description": "\nWhat awakens within us when temptation gives way to truth? \nThis performance in chaste Malayalam brings to life Mahakavi Vallathol Menon\u2019s lyrical poem Magdalana Mariam through the timeless vocabulary of Bharatanatyam. The poem narrates the story of Mariam, a woman who rises from poverty to wealth, only to find herself ensnared by pride and desire. One night, a moment of stark realization shatters her illusions, revealing the emptiness of her existence. \nHer encounter with Christ transforms this despair into redemption, and it is this very arc from vanity to awakening, that unfolds on stage. Through evocative abhinaya, intricate rhythm, and the expressive power of Bharatanatyam, the performance turns Vallathol\u2019s poetry into a moving meditation on the possibility of renewal. \nA story of loss, grace, and transformation, waiting to be felt through movement and verse! \n \n \nCredits: \nMusic: Dr. O.S.

    "description": "67 minutes | Kannada, English and Hindi with English subtitles | Germany, India | 2025 \nOn January 22, 2024, much of India came to a halt as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a grand temple to Lord Ram, built on the contested site of a demolished mosque. The spectacle, meticulously staged, gave the ruling party a decisive advantage ahead of the 2024 Indian elections, further splintering an already divided opposition. \nSangama\u00a0is a powerful portrait of democracy at work in Southern India. The film follows the campaign of Wake-up Karnataka (WK), a citizen-led coalition mobilizing national networks to challenge the decade-long dominance of the BJP. \nJourneying with Team WK, by train, car, and on foot, the film captures their efforts to steer clear of polarizing rhetoric and instead spotlight urgent, everyday issues: unemployment, farmer distress, and the rising cost of essentials. \u201cOur tradition has taught us to love and not hate,\u201d one senior member affirms, encapsulating their ethos. \nFrom intimate community meetings and voter registration drives to the energy of massive political rallies, an intricate mosaic of the Indian election unfolds. Voices from the ground echo the people\u2019s concerns: \u201cModi may have done a lot for the rich, but daily wagers haven\u2019t benefited at all.\u201d \nAs the summer intensifies, so do the campaigns\u2014and with them, caste-based clashes stirred by political forces. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister amplifies anti-Muslim rhetoric, unsettled that strident Hindu nationalism is losing its appeal. Protests demanding accountability from pliant election officials expose the unevenness of the playing field. Through it all, Team WK persists, moving village to village, booth to booth, ensuring that people cast their votes. \nCommissioned by the Centre for Modern Indian Studies, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, the film is part of Election Diaries 2024,\u00a0a series of nine campaigns across India that celebrate the resilience of democracy. At a time when authoritarian regimes are on the rise and narrow visions of nationhood threaten to erase cultural plurality, Sangama\u00a0reminds us that an alternative vision of collective resistance and unity endures. \nThe screening will be followed by an interactive discussion with Tara Rao, Noor Sridhar and Mallige Sirimane from Eddelu Karnataka, and filmmaker Sunanda Bhat. The session, moderated by Pooja Prasanna, will conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "98 minutes | English, Russian and German | 2022 \nEnthralling and intimate, the Oscar-winning documentary Navalny, directed by Daniel Roher, unfolds with the pace of a thriller as it follows Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny in his quest to identify the men who poisoned him in August 2020. Shot in Germany as the story unfolded, the film offers extraordinary access to the investigation while also portraying Navalny the man\u2014a reformist leader who refuses to be cowed, even by an assassination attempt. \nThe documentary takes viewers inside the meticulous investigation into the shocking poisoning, revealing who was behind it. Navalny\u2019s years-long campaign against corruption among Russia\u2019s elites has earned him powerful enemies, particularly Vladimir Putin, who pointedly refuses to utter his name in public. In August 2020, Navalny was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent in an elaborate attempt on his life. Despite official denials, independent investigations by Bellingcat, CNN, and others later linked the attack to the Kremlin. \nThe film Navalny is produced by Odessa Rae (RaeFilm Studios), Diane Becker and Melanie Miller (Fishbowl Films), Shane Boris (Cottage M), and Amy Entelis and Courtney Sexton (CNN Films), with Maria Pevchikh as executive producer. \nFollowing the screening, a discussion between Aakar Patel and Swati Dandekar will take place, followed by an audience Q&A. \nPlease note: Director Daniel Roher will not be present. \nViewer discretion: Children under 17 are restricted from viewing the film unless accompanied by an adult. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Step into one of the most remote and pristine places on Earth, without leaving Bangalore. In this immersive session, traveller, photographer, and storyteller Raksha Nagaraj takes you on an unforgettable journey to Antarctica through striking photographs and firsthand narratives of her expedition to the White Continent. \nThe talk reveals Antarctica\u2019s awe-inspiring landscapes, towering icebergs, endless oceans, and surreal stretches of ice that few have ever seen. But it goes beyond scenery. Raksha\u2019s photographs capture extraordinary encounters with wildlife: playful penguins, curious seals, and majestic whales, each image paired with stories that bring their behaviour to life in this extreme environment. \nAdding a scientific dimension, Raksha shares her experience participating in a Citizen Science program, where travellers assisted researchers by collecting plankton samples, studying fjord freshwater impact on seawater, and recording data critical to understanding climate change. These efforts highlight how exploration can meaningfully contribute to global research. Part personal narrative, part visual adventure, this session blends exploration, adventure, science, and storytelling. It reflects the wonder of standing at the edge of the world and the urgency of protecting such fragile ecosystems in a rapidly changing climate. \nJoin us for an evening of discovery, photography, and conversation, and see Antarctica as few have ever experienced it. Irrespective of whether you are an adventurer, nature enthusiast, or simply want to know about this beautiful white continent, this journey promises to inspire and perhaps spark dreams of your own voyage to Antarctica. \n",
