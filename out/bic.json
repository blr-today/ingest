    "description": "You were born in an Indian state. You live and study in an Indian state. You, like every other Indian, call at least one state home. Your state is a big part of your identity. And yet, do you know the story of how your state was created? \nCome listen to the incredible origin stories of each of India\u2019s twenty-eight states and eight union territories, spanning from Independence until today. The state that wasn\u2019t even a part of India until 1975; the union territory that had a prime minister for a single day; the state that had three capitals; and the union territory that has beaches on both coasts! The session also includes a fun quiz that you don\u2019t want to miss! \nWe at BIC have put together a day, full of events at our Library, to celebrate the 76th year of the Indian Constitution with kids at the heart of our programmes. Through stories, quizzes, and fun-filled sessions, we aim\u00a0to get young minds thinking a little bit more in depth about our constitution and country.\u00a0 \nYou can view the other two events here and here. \n",

    "description": "Midlife is a phase when we find ourselves pulled in multiple directions\u2014across work, home, health, friendships, and hobbies. \nIn this session, Ravi Venkatesan delves into themes from Deepak Jayaraman\u2019s recent book, Play to Potential. The book offers a nuanced exploration of how to unlock human potential\u2014not just professionally but holistically\u2014by embracing life\u2019s highs and lows. Drawing from his acclaimed Play to Potential podcast and his experiences as a coach, Deepak introduces the FLAVOUR framework, a practical guide to navigating the intricate interplay of family, aspirations, values, and relationships. \nDeepak emphasises that life is a team sport, with family serving as an essential support system. He argues that personal growth and achievement are deeply intertwined with our family contexts, a perspective often overlooked in self-help literature, particularly in cultures where family plays a central role. \nA key insight of the book is the recognition that life unfolds in seasons, shaped by transitions\u2014some intentional, others unexpected. Using real-life examples and case studies, Deepak illustrates how navigating these transitions thoughtfully is vital to realising our potential. \nThis discussion will resonate with anyone in their 30s to 60s, offering valuable strategies to lead a multi-dimensional, purposeful life. A Q&A session will follow. \n",

    "description": "India has a unique relationship with the mango. It is all over our cultural life and festivals. Our emotional life and our social existence. Our markets and our countryside. It is the only fruit that is a festival unto itself. Each year, cities organize their own mango festivals that are extremely popular events. No other fruit seems to have a comparable role anywhere else. The mango seems intimately familiar to almost all Indians, nay, all residents of South Asia. Yet we are unaware of the wider role of the mango fruit, leaves, flowers, trees, orchards and groves in almost every facet of our lives through our known and unknown history. In politics, economics, land ownership, infrastructure, ecological (and psychological) health, propaganda, diplomacy, ecology, festivities, funerals, weddings, seduction, poetry, the arts, architecture\u2026 \nDrawing from the recently published bestseller\u00a0Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango, this discussion will join the ubiquitous excitement around mangoes to look towards avenues untrodden, histories unconsidered, festivals abandoned. The event will take place close to the time that marked India\u2019s myriad spring festivals, the symbol of which was the mango flower. The known mango is a bridge to a lot about us that is either unknown or goes unacknowledged. \nThe author, Sopan Joshi will be in conversation with\u00a0Venu Madhav Govindu which will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Dido and Aeneas\u00a0in Bangalore is a unique collaboration project, bringing together some of the finest musicians from India and Sweden, in a performance of one of the most beloved chamber operas from the Baroque-period. Experience the passionate drama through stirring instrumental music, dance, arias and choirs \u2013 a must-see-hear in Bangalore in 2025! \nDido and Aeneas is based on Book IV of Virgil\u2019s epic The Aeneid. It is one of the earliest known English operas, and one of the most important and often performed operas written in the Baroque period. It is also Henry Purcell\u2019s only true opera; that is, his only all-sung dramatic work. \nWhat is most remarkable for such an important work in the opera repertoire, is that so little about it is known. A copy of a libretto from the 1700\u2019s exists (possibly from the first performance), so we know it originally was composed as a Prologue and Opera. However, the music for the Prologue, the end of the act II Grove scene, and several dances have been lost, and indeed no score exists in Purcell\u2019s handwriting. \nMoreover, the dates of composition and the first performance are uncertain. It is known, through references in letters, that it was performed at a girls\u2019 school in Chelsea, London, some time before the end of 1689. However, some scholars argue that the opera was composed and performed for the Royal Court of either James II or Charles II with a date as early as 1684, and argue that the reference in the Prologue to the joy of a marriage between two monarchs is an allegorical one. \nWhatever history of the opera is waiting to be uncovered, what we do know, and perhaps most important of all, is that Purcell\u2019s Dido and Aeneas is a deeply moving and unforgettable opera. \nDido, Queen of Carthage \u2013 Maria Forsstr\u00f6m, mezzo-soprano\nAeneas, Trojan hero \u2013 Rahul Bharadwaj, baritone\nBelinda, Dido\u2019s confidante and handmaiden \u2013 Tanisha Herbert Rozario, soprano\nSecond Lady \u2013 Rachel Mathew, soprano\nSorceress \u2013 Sangita Santosham, mezzo-soprano\n1st Witch \u2013 Rebekah Alexander, soprano\n2nd Witch \u2013 Ketki Herlekar, soprano\nA Sailor \u2013 Benson Chacko, tenor\nA Spirit \u2013 Nora Alexy, alto \nViolin \u2013 Carol George & Arun Rozario\nViola \u2013 Maria Winiarski\nCello \u2013 Kristina Winiarski\nBass \u2013 Jasiel Peter\nHarpsichord \u2013 Rebecca Thomas Colaco\nPercussion \u2013 Akshay Nagmule\nGuitar \u2013 Ryal Sequiera\nConductor \u2013 Sofia Winiarski \nCappella Bangalore\nThe Bangalore Men \nConductor \u2013 Jonas Olsson \nDancers from The Lewis Foundation of Classical Ballet\nChoreographer: Iryna Hryshukova\nDancers: Iryna Hryshukova, Elina Wisung, Ramya Manikam, Tanvi Agarwal \nIn collaboration with\u00a0Legato School of Music and The Lewis Foundation of Classical Ballet \n\u00a0\u00a0 \nSupported by\u00a0the Swedish Arts Council and the Swedish Arts Grants Committee \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Karnataka is one of India\u2019s most diverse states, as rich in literary and cultural traditions as it is in democratic struggles and political churns. The 20th century witnessed the birth of a modern Kannada renaissance, accompanied by the emergence of a powerful social conscience.\u00a0\u00a0Against this backdrop, one young man\u2019s quest to explore his vibrant historical roots leads to an ambitious attempt to unpack the region\u2019s social and cultural histories. \nRama\u00a0Bhima\u00a0Soma\u00a0is an enterprise of translation and rediscovery, packed with stories and conversations. The book explores a dizzyingly wide sweep of Karnataka\u2019s contemporary history\u2014the life and times of legends like Kuvempu and Shivaram Karanth; the fall of Socialism and the rise of the Hindu Right; the intellectual ruminations of U.R. Ananthamurthy, D.R. Nagaraj and M.M. Kalburgi; the wildly popular television serials of T.N. Seetharam and the community-centred one-woman theatre shows of Du Saraswathi; a brief history of Naxalism in Karnataka and glimpses of other complicated legacies of the 1970s\u2019 Left. \nMarshalling a diverse range of literary and scholarly resources, framed through biographical sketches and immersive reportage, this session will reanimate some pivotal moments in the making of modern Karnataka.

Where did the Cholas acquire the copper required to cast the many temple bronzes that are solid heavy pieces of metal? Why were the Cholas obsessed with island Sri Lanka? What were the circumstances that permitted the creation of hundreds of temples and vast numbers of sacred bronzes despite the constant warfare that the Chola monarchs were engaged in? What was the source of the extraordinarily vast number of pearls that, together with coral, rubies and diamonds, were embedded in gold jewelry gifted to adorn temple bronzes? Why did the Cholas cover the walls of their temple walls with inscriptions\u2013 some 13,000 in total \u2013 using temple walls as if they were the public records office? \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "How on earth did Stephen Huyler find himself pedalling a bicycle rickshaw at the Indian border on his twentieth birthday? Intriguing stories like this define Huyler\u2019s life and his metamorphosis into a leading documentarian of the cultures and peoples of India. \nEarly in his career as an anthropologist and art historian, Stephen Huyler recognized that most of the world had little access to feeling the pulse of the peoples of South Asia. In the fifty-two years since his unusual first entry into India, Stephen has traversed the subcontinent dozens of times by a wide variety of transportation in order to conduct a detailed survey of India\u2019s village and other subcultures. \nHis innate friendliness has always opened doors, while his skills as a writer and photographer have allowed him to create books and museum exhibitions of material never before recorded. \nThis session draws on Huyler\u2019s book Transformed By India,\u00a0exploring his many encounters, from maharajahs to musicians, Dalits to Brahmins, politicians to potters. Tying all the many stories together is the innate strength and creative capacity for improvement expressed everywhere in the subcontinent. \nIn this session, Stephen Huyler will be in conversation with Sandhya Mendonca. This will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "The concert pays homage to the Goddess Saraswati, revered through the ages as the embodiment of the four essentials of a discerning human life: Speech (Vaani), the foundation of communication and expression; Music (Sangeet), the universal language of harmony and emotion; Wisdom (Buddhi), the guiding light of understanding and insight; and Discrimination (Vivek), the power to discern and choose wisely. \nThrough a journey of timeless raags and original compositions, our musicians delve into these eternal qualities, reflecting the grace and profundity that the Goddess represents. This celebration is not just a tribute to Saraswati but a call to connect with the divine essence of creativity, intellect, and balance within us all. \nSupported by: \n \n",
