    "description": "49 mins | Hindi with English subtitles | 2019 | India \nIn a quiet village outside Delhi, two sisters grow old without growing tired. \nSet in Lahra, this tender documentary follows 86- and 93-year-old widowed sisters who have chosen a slower pace and fuller life in a village far from the noise of the city. With creaky knees and sharp tongues, they navigate their days with walkers and wit. Unapologetic, unhurried, and largely unbothered by the looming presence of age or death. \nTheir closest companions are not blood relatives, but their adopted family of domestic help. Together, they share a rhythm of television, sun-soaked afternoons, casual gossip, and everyday caregiving. Shot by their niece visiting for the first time, the film captures this unusual household with quiet affection and a light, observant eye. \nIn their unassuming way, the sisters offer a radical lesson: that talking openly about death can make life more meaningful. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmaker and producer. \nFilm Trailer \n",

    "description": "At its heart, The Dark Hours of the Night is a story about girlhood under constraint, about how adolescence, desire, and freedom are shaped and stifled within the walls of a conservative household. \nRabia\u2019s journey, woven together with the lives of her friends and cousins, illuminates the subtle negotiations, unspoken rebellions, and fragile solidarities that mark women\u2019s coming-of-age in a patriarchal world. The novel opens a conversation about the everyday intimacies of restriction and resistance: the ache of thwarted desire, the bonds of friendship, the weight of silence, and the difficult balance between compromise and courage. It asks what it means to grow up when the future has already been decided, and whether education, love, or even small acts of defiance can shift those boundaries. \nIn this session, Subodh Sankar and Salma will reflect on these resonant themes, of gender, family, power, and the search for selfhood, that lie at the centre of The Dark Hours of the Night and across Salma\u2019s larger body of work.

    "description": "The Mughal court breathed in rhythm and melody.\u00a0 \nFrom dawn prayers to twilight revelries, from joyous weddings to the thunder of battle, music augmented every moment of life. Painters of the time caught these echoes in colour: musicians in the durbar, women singing in the zenana, instruments poised in the naubatkhanas of gateways, songs rising even in hunting fields. \nIn this illustrated lecture, Dr. Asok Kumar Das will discuss the presence of music and musicians in a selection of paintings dating from the reign of Humayun (r.1530-40, 1555-56) to Shah Jahan (r.1628-1658). These exquisite paintings reveal an enduring ensemble of percussion, wind and string instruments, and performers of all genders and creeds making music for specific occasions. \nStep closer to an age where melody was power, poetry, and prayer all at once. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "How do we\u00a0represent those who peopled Indian agrarian history? \nThese talks explore the place of oral narrative in reconstructing India\u2019s post-Independence agricultural history, especially some of its less known though no less defining moments. As important as watershed events and policy interventions are to the making of agrarian history, the contributions of other actors, among them landless agricultural\u00a0workers, peasants, political workers and agricultural scientists, must also be given their place. The perceptions of agrarian change as evaluated and voiced by those who made significant contributions to the course of agrarian history makes for a more textured view of social and economic change in rural India. \nThrough first-hand accounts from the lab and\u00a0the field we see how individual experience and social context shaped the making of agrarian history in\u00a0India after independence. These stories don\u2019t just add detail; they shift perspective, showing how knowledge and change emerge through lived realities. \nParvathi Menon, former Resident Editor of\u00a0The Hindu, and historian of science Sandipan Baksi will share insights from two major oral history projects, moderated by Madhura Swaminathan of the Indian Statistical Institute. \nAn invitation to listen closely to the stories that have shaped our reality today. \nThis discussion is part of the 69th edition of the Archives Public Lecture Series, which focuses on explorations in and around the archives at NCBS. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n",

    "description": "A voice shaped by tradition, carried forward with imagination. \nTrained in the revered lineages of the Gwalior, Jaipur, and Agra gharanas, vocalist Shiv Prasad Rao brings to life the timeless art of khayal gayaki. His music is a delicate balance: lyrical and intricate, contemplative yet deeply expressive, rooted in parampara but alive with improvisation. \nIn this performance, he presents traditional compositions in the styles of his gharanas, shaped by his own distinctive approach to lyrical and rhythmic improvisation. The result is not just your average recital, but an immersion into the evolving, ever-resonant world of Hindustani classical music. \nEnhancing this evening\u2019s performance are two remarkable artists whose journeys reflect equal dedication. Vighnesh Bhagavat Yellapur, Hindustani classical vocalist and harmonium player, brings a blend of rigour and sensitivity, enriching every raga with depth and clarity. On tabla, Kaustuv, channels a lifetime of rhythmic exploration. Praised for his precision and vitality, he anchors and elevates the music with subtlety and power. \nTogether, these artists create a tapestry of melody, rhythm, and improvisation\u2014an evening of Hindustani classical music where tradition meets spontaneity and rhythm flows seamlessly into melody. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "What happens when institutions bend, freedoms collapse, and silence rules? India once knew. \nFive decades may have passed, but the Emergency remains a stark reminder of how swiftly freedoms can be curtailed. In those 21 months, prisons filled, the press was silenced, and democratic institutions bent under the weight of authoritarian rule. The questions it leaves behind are urgent: what does this episode tell us about the fragility of democracy, and what echoes of it persist today? \nA new volume gathers reflections from scholars, writers, historians, journalists, and activists to probe this turbulent chapter and its continuing relevance. Joining the discussion are Peter Ronald de Souza, co-editor of the book, historian Janaki Nair, sociologist Chandan Gowda, and political scientist Rinku Lamba, in a conversation moderated by Thomas Abraham.\u00a0 \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

In a quiet Swiss town, loved ones gather from across the world to raise a last toast, while a filmmaker friend documents the delicate passage between celebration and farewell. What unfolds is a tender meditation on choice, companionship, and the courage to define one\u2019s own ending. \nLayered with memory and emotion, the film draws viewers into a journey where the everyday collides with the profound, and where the act of bearing witness becomes as significant as the story itself. \nAfter the screening, directors Nilesh Maniyar and\u00a0Shonali Bose will be present for an in-person discussion with Sandhya Kumar, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \nCheck out the trailer here \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "The Masterclass Hegemony, Revolt and Selfhood: India\u2019s Encounters with Languages explores three defining moments in India\u2019s linguistic journey: the arrival of Sanskrit, Persian, and English. Each language came from beyond India\u2019s borders, gained a foothold, and extended its influence across diverse cultures, communities, and tongues. Their dominance shaped not only communication but also identity, politics, and thought. Thus, becoming inseparable from the larger story of India itself. \nThese lectures will trace how each language consolidated its power, how resistance took form, and how new voices emerged in the process. Strikingly, in every encounter, it was not the imperial language that endured, but the languages rooted in the soil (the desa, the nadu) that reshaped and redefined the cultural landscape. \nAs we step into an uncertain digital future, this series asks whether India\u2019s linguistic resilience will once again carry it forward, as it has so often before. \nSep 18 | Language and Hegemony | 6:30 PM\nExplore how Sanskrit, Persian, and English reshaped India across centuries. Each entered from outside, claimed cultural power, and ruled the imagination, but India remained a linguistic civilization defined by diversity. This talk uncovers why language became both a tool of hegemony and the essence of India\u2019s selfhood. \nSep 19 | Decline and Transformation | 6:30 PM\nSanskrit reigned for millennia, Persian for centuries, English for decades. Yet, none endured unchallenged. Each gave way to the resilient desi-bhashas, rooted in the land and people. This lecture traces the rise, fall, and transformation of languages in India, and what these shifts reveal about power and imagination. \nSep 20 | Language between Nationalism and Technology | 6:30 PM\nIn today\u2019s charged climate, languages carry the weight of both nationalism and digital futures. This session asks how India\u2019s linguistic diversity will evolve in the twenty-first century, and whether the voices of many can thrive amid the pulls of technology, identity, and the search for cultural belonging. \n",

    "description": "Between Gandhi and Savarkar lies the story of India\u2019s unresolved future. \nThe future of India has long been caught between two irreconcilable visions. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar were not just men, but embodiments of two enduring ideologies: Hind Swaraj and Hindutva. Their contest was never merely personal; it was a struggle over what India could, and should, become. \nPartition was one gash on the body of the nation, its scars still visible. Can India afford new wounds? To even attempt an answer, we must return to the old antagonisms \u2013 between communities, yes, but also within Hindu society itself. Few rivalries have been as sharp, or as consequential, as that between Gandhi and Savarkar. \nBased on his new book, Hindutva and Hind Swaraj, this talk reflects on the unresolved gulf between Gandhi and Savarkar. Not as history, but as a question that remains open: can such differences ever be bridged, or are they the fault lines of India\u2019s future? \n",

Tales from Rumi\u2019s Masnavi unfold beside episodes from Kabeer\u2019s life, drawing audiences into the philosophies that shaped them and the spiritual journeys they invite us to walk. \nThough born in different worlds, their words echo the same longing: love, surrender, and the search for the divine. More than a concert, the evening offers an immersion into mysticism itself. Music and poetry intertwine, creating spaces for reflection, wonder, and stillness.\u00a0 \nThis is a celebration of unity in diversity through the timeless legacies of Kabeer and Rumi that continue to awaken the eternal within us. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "From clay beds to concert halls, what stories does a pot carry? \nThe ghatam begins its life in mud drawn from ponds and lakes, spun carefully on a wheel by the potter\u2019s hand. Once fired, it waits quietly until a musician coaxes rhythm from its body.\u00a0 \nIn Song of the Clay Pot \u2013 My Journey with the Ghatam, Sumana Chandrashekar traces this remarkable journey, weaving together myth, history, and her own life as a ghatam artist. Along the way, she opens a window onto Carnatic music\u2019s hidden histories: from the instrument\u2019s early marginalisation and the years of AIR\u2019s harmonium ban, to the delicate hierarchies that shape relationships between performers. \nChandrashekar also reflects on being a woman in this world: the unspoken rules, the pressure to conform, and her conscious choice to step outside tradition\u2019s prescribed attire. \nIn conversation with Arundhati Ghosh, she invites us to consider not just the sound of the ghatam, but the politics, aesthetics, and lived experiences it holds within its clay. The discussion concludes with a Q&A. \nA morning where earth, music, and memory find rhythm together. \n",
