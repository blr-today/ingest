    "description": "India\u2019s sporting landscape has dramatically transformed over the past few decades. Traditionally dominated by cricket, the country has emerged as a powerhouse in multiple disciplines, including badminton, wrestling, boxing, and athletics. \nThe rise of leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Pro Kabaddi League, and Indian Super League (ISL) has played a crucial role in popularizing various sports and providing financial support to athletes. Additionally, India\u2019s improved performance in global events like the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, and Asian Games has boosted national pride.\u00a0Charu\u00a0Sharma with his decades of experience leading RCB and even conceptualizing Kabbadi League will tell this story. \nThe\u00a0Devatha Radhakrishna Memorial Lecture \nDevatha Radhakrishna was not only a visionary entrepreneur but a lifelong seeker\u2014curious, resilient, and deeply reflective.

    "description": "How do you capture something as fluid and ephemeral as dance \u2014 a gesture, a rhythm, a moment in motion? In this talk, photographer Shalini Jain shares her approach to photographing performance, where timing, intuition, and emotion come together to create images that resonate beyond the frame. Drawing from her work with dancers and musicians, she explores how stillness can reflect movement, and how the camera becomes a quiet partner in the act of performance. Through images and reflection, Shalini offers a glimpse into the art of seeing rhythm and holding on to what might otherwise be lost in a blink. \nThis will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nThis event is part of our International Dance Day celebrations Echoes of the Moving Body. \n",

    "description": "As a part of World Dance Day celebrations, this session will celebrate the rich tapestry of Indian classical dance by showcasing a curated blend of solo, duet, and group performances, each representing diverse classical traditions from across the country. \nHari Ho\u2026Gati Meri\nA Solo by Gauri Diwakar \nHari Ho\u2026Gati Meri (let my salvation be in the supreme) is a statement of \u201cYou\u201d. It is a search for salvation, truth and for beauty.\nBased on the poetry of Sayyad Fazlul Hasan popularly known as Maulana Hasrat Mohani, the work revolves around the eternal resonance of Krishna\u2019s flute.\nIs the melody emerging out of Krishna\u2019s flute a message beckoning to eternal life or the fount of ever\u00a0increasing knowledge?\nI search you else where, ignorant me! Waiting, waiting and letting life go by, while you reside within the deepest core of me. Let my senses be open to you, within me.\nI hear the flute, I see the melody, I feel the love! \nCredits :\nConcept & Research : Sanjay Nandan\nChoreography :\u00a0 Aditi Mangaldas\nMusic composition, vocals & harmonium: Samiullah Khan \nNatya Samanwayam\nA Duet by Sujatha Nair and Gururaju \nOur Indian classical dances bear testimony to the national ethos of Unity in Diversity. Multiple forms, Single spirit. Here is an attempt to reaffirm this unique trait of our country, through the coming together of two of our popular classical dance styles; Kuchipudi & Mohiniyattam.\u00a0 Adhering to the traditions and flavors of individual styles, blending seamlessly, an amalgamation of visual beauty and serenity is created. This is an invocatory piece that sees the blend of a Marathi Nirupan which is abhinaya oriented with a Swathitirunal Kriti, a Nritta composition, Tillana. \nAnadi Ananta: The Seamless One\nA Group Performance by Minal Prabhu & Mudrika\u00a0Foundation for Indian Performing Arts \nThis piece is inspired by Advaita Vedanta, where Brahman is the ultimate, singular truth and all other manifestations are mere illusions of that truth. Jagat Chaitanya- the beam of light, the Parabrahman, symbolizes the eternal cycle of creation and destruction\u2014without beginning or end. Shiva\u2019s cosmic dance embodies this rhythm of life, death and rebirth. Through the rhythm created by his movement, breath, damaru and the sweat that fell off his dancing body, he created the Pancha Bhootas, the five elements \u2013 Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Space, which form the foundation of existence. \nThe manifestation of these elements is the manifestation of Brahman itself. With this production, we bow to Parabrahman through the ethereal embodiment of the Pancha Bhootas. \nThis event is part of our International Dance Day celebrations Echoes of the Moving Body. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Yeats \nOn World Dance Day, we invite you into this dissolving space between dancer and dance\u2014where form meets feeling, stillness meets motion, and art becomes lived experience. \nOur celebration this year unfolds across disciplines, perspectives, and rhythms. We begin by pausing\u2014through the lens of photographer Shalini Jain\u2014as she captures movement in stillness and the stories told in a dancer\u2019s fleeting gesture. From this quiet contemplation, we shift into the immediacy of the body: \u201cA Meeting,\u201d a contemporary duet by Gayatri Shetty and Ronita Mukherjee, explores presence, dialogue, and connection through movement. \nAs the evening deepens, we journey into \u201cThe World in Motion,\u201d a confluence of Indian classical forms\u2014Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Mohiniyattam and Kathak\u2014brought to life by Gauri Diwakar, Sujata Nair Sanjay, Gururaju, Minal Prabhu, and the Mudrika Foundation. Here, tradition is not static but ever evolving, and every step becomes a living archive. \nAcross these experiences, we celebrate dance not only as performance, but as conversation\u2014between bodies, between time periods, between disciplines.

    "description": "A Meeting is embedded in the tumultuous emotional and physical dynamics between its two characters, highlighting the complexities of human connection and the emotional landscape of desire and disconnection. What connections are able to form if we simply allow and make space and stop? It evokes reflection on the meaning of love, the nature of relationships and the interplay between connection and solitude. The dancers will meet themselves from different timelines of their life and what happens to the present when the past and future meet. It is a love letter to all that once was and is.\nDancers will draw from their own lives to showcase the push and pull of relationships, emphasizing moments of intense connection, followed by periods of emotional and physical dissonance, reflecting their internal and external conflicts.\nAt a point in this world when our global unity and resistance is so essential, our daily human connections seem to be falling apart. This piece is a shared yearning and longing for each other, its one for hope, loss and desire for freedom. \nChoreography & Concept \u2013 Gayatri Shetty\nMovement Collaborator- Ronita Mookerji\nMusic \u2013 Riddhiman Dutta & Michael Wall \nThis event is part of our International Dance Day celebrations Echoes of the Moving Body. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "The early medieval period in South Karnataka was a time of vigorous cultural change. Between the 10th and 13th centuries CE, it became a frontier region between the sprawling Chola and Chalukya empires, allowing for migration, the development of new trade networks, and the rise of innovative temple cultures. Tamil peasant-warriors and traders settled in South Karnataka, significantly contributing to the region\u2019s already cosmopolitan character\u2014an influence still visible in the temple architecture of Bengaluru and its vicinity. The Chola presence also introduced new models of royal power that shaped the emerging Hoysala dynasty. Drawing on architectural, art historical, and epigraphical material, Anirudh Kanisetti examines the Chola impact on South Karnataka and how it continues to shape Bengaluru\u2019s urbanism today. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "In honor of International Jazz Day, the Bangalore International Centre (BIC) presents a day of events exploring jazz\u2019s rich history, global influence, and contemporary expressions. Through a lecture, a listening session, and a live performance, we delve into jazz\u2019s evolution from its roots in New Orleans to its resonance in diverse cultures worldwide. \nJazz: The Style, Structure, and the World Stage by Ramjee Chandran | Lecture |\u00a04pm \u2013 5:15pm \nJazz is admired for its complex harmonies, distinctive phrasing, and improvisational depth. But what gives it its unique identity? And why does it continue to resonate across generations and cultures?\u00a0This lecture traces the journey of jazz from its roots in New Orleans and the swing era to the innovations of bebop and beyond\u2014cool jazz, hard bop, and free jazz. It explores how each style reflects changing ideas in music and society, and how jazz evolved from popular entertainment to a sophisticated art form.\u00a0Though born in America, jazz has travelled widely\u2014from Brazilian bossa nova to India. While Latin jazz found global popularity, the question remains: can there ever be a true Indo-jazz fusion that honours both traditions? \nFrom New Orleans to New Delhi: How Jazz Got Its Passport Stamped by Abhijit Nath | Listening Room |\u00a05:30pm \u2013 6:45pm \nJazz, while being a quintessentially American form, has a short enough history that other cultures found ways to assimilate their own sounds into it. Starting from the early Latin jazz sounds of the 40s, jazz found its way to South America, through tango and bossa nova, to its classical harmony roots through the work of ECM records in the 1970s, to Africa through afrobeat and World Circuit records, and of course to the modal music of Asia through greats such as John McLaughlin, Dhafer Youssef and Tigran Hamasyan. Jazz takes on the garb of the music of its day, whether it be jazz rock fusion in the 1980s, samples heard on Kendrick Lamar records, or the unique electronic-influenced sound of Alfa Mist. \nTime Travels in Jazz: From Bop to Beyond by Diptangshu\u00a0Bhowmik &\u00a0Kiran Ponnaluri | Performance |\u00a07pm \u2013 8:30pm \nStep into an evening of rhythm, harmony, and stories as two dynamic voices from Bangalore\u2019s contemporary music scene \u2014 Diptangshu and Kiran \u2014 take you on a journey through the evolving landscape of jazz. Tracing the arc of jazz from the bebop era to modern swing and straight-ahead explorations, this performance is more than a concert \u2014 it\u2019s a conversation. Through their set, the duo will unravel how jazz has transformed across time, place, and genre, weaving in their own personal trajectories that led from London, Calcutta, and Bangalore to this moment on stage. \n",

    "description": "When the powers that be in Delhi think of Farooq Abdullah, they think of former R&AW chief A.S. Dulat, too. The Abdullah\u2013Dulat connection \u2013 unlikely, even dangerous \u2013 has shaped Kashmir\u2019s history in ways that few understand. One was India\u2019s top intelligence officer, the other its most defiant Kashmiri leader. They should have been enemies. Instead, they built a quiet, complicated alliance that has outlasted governments, betrayals and shadow wars. \nFrom the explosion of militancy in the 1990s to the hijacking of Air India\u2019s IC-814 in 1999 and the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, their story is inseparable from Kashmir\u2019s most turbulent moments. In this book, for the first time, Dulat turns to the man behind the legend. What is Farooq like when the cameras are off? How did 370 alter his place in Kashmir\u2019s future? What divides him from his son and heir, Omar?

    "description": "Join us at the BIC Library for a Blackout Poetry event where you\u2019ll get to transform pages from your favourite books into original poems. \nBlackout poetry is a unique form of artistic expression that involves taking an existing text, often a page from a book, newspaper, or magazine, and selectively blacking out or \u201cblacking over\u201d certain words and phrases to create a new, cohesive, and visually striking piece of poetry. \nCome with a few pages of text from a book you like (or peruse our selection), grab your marker and get started! Participants are given a dedicated period to create their blackout poetry. During this, they flip through the pages of their choice, looking for words or phrases that resonate with them, and use markers to black out the remaining text. \nThe goal is to craft meaningful and visually engaging poems that personally resonates with you followed by a small sharing circle where you\u2019ll get to read out your work! \n",

    "description": "Barahmasi, is an amalgamation of semi classical genres sung throughout the year just like the Periwinkle or Barahmasi flower that blooms round the year. An enchanting curation of thumri, dadra, tappa, chaiti, kajri, hori, jhoola, ghazal, bhajan and beautiful Malwi folk tunes, Barahmasi is an interactive show featuring Kanakshree and Savni Bhatt where they will perform the 12 semi-classical forms of Indian music that resonate throughout the year. Delve into the harmonious world of Indian classical music, where each note is steeped in tradition and brought to life with the passion of two generations. \nIt has been observed that Indian Classical mehfils often end with a semi classical composition like thumri, dadra or sometimes the season dependent chaiti or kajri. However, the constraints of time and season shouldn\u2019t stop one from enjoying these forms at any time of the year\u2026 The very thought gave birth to Barahmasi\u00a0where one walks out with songs of the year that echo in one\u2019s heart and a one of its kind experiences where all of the said forms come together in a single concert. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "The pot in its various forms is the most common musical instrument in India. Cutting across all musical genres, the ghatam has spoken the musical language of the common people as well as expert drummers. \nIn Indian wisdom and bhakti traditions too, the clay pot holds a very special place. Mystics, poets and saints spanning many centuries and regions have extensively used the metaphor of the clay pot to talk about the fragility of the human body and the enormous possibilities of human existence. \nIn this performance titled The Universe in a Pot, musicians Sumana and Saitejas bring together a sonic and a lyrical experience centred around the simple clay pot. The performance takes the audience on a musical journey that blends together the diverse soundscapes that are possible on this simple yet powerful instrument, along with songs, stories and poetry of the mystics that celebrate the pot. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "English | 73 mins | India | 2025 \nIn an era where our lives increasingly depend on satellites for everything from communication to weather forecasting, The Dirty Sky delves into the escalating crisis of orbital debris \u2013 the uncontrolled trash accumulating in space. Through a detailed exploration of the history of satellite launches, the film sheds light on the exponential increase in non-functional satellites, leading to a severe threat to our orbital environment and space sustainability. It underscores the growing dangers posed by orbital debris, which, much like terrestrial pollution, is an unseen but pervasive threat to space activities. The Dirty Sky emphasizes the urgency for global awareness and action. It advocates for the public and world leaders to raise a concerted voice, urging competing nations and commercial companies to take concrete steps before our beautiful sky becomes as uninhabitable as the polluted seas and air on Earth \u2013 the only home humanity has. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A session with the filmmaker. \n\u00a0 \n",
