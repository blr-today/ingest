Light, space, and sound work together to draw listeners into the unfolding emotional landscape of the raag. \nMusic endures not by remaining closed, but by absorbing, listening, and transforming. This evening\u2019s performance is a true testament to the trends that have become tradition. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Once known as a garden city and a pensioner\u2019s paradise, Bengaluru has undergone extraordinary economic and demographic change over the past three decades. While growth has brought opportunity, it has also reshaped everyday life in ways that go far beyond traffic and waste.\u00a0This second edition of The Bengaluru Debates turns a critical lens on our city to ask whether it still supports healthy lives for its citizens. \nPublic health research increasingly shows that the roots of urban ill-health lie not only in hospitals or clinics, but in planning, infrastructure, and governance. Air quality, water and sanitation, food systems, mobility, housing design, open spaces, and access to light and ventilation all shape how healthy a city allows its people to be. Yet these questions rarely enter public debate in Bengaluru. \nOpening with a short context setting, the session will move into a panel discussion between\u00a0Dinesh Gundu Rao, Hon\u2019ble Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Government of Karnataka; Dr. C N Ashwath Narayan, Former Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka and Member of the Legislative Assembly for Malleshwaram; Dr. Shreelata Rao Seshadri, Professor and Director, Ramalingaswami Centre for Equity and Social Determinants of Health, Public Health Foundation of India(PHFI). Moderated by Srikanth Viswanathan, CEO, Janaagraha, the panel will reflect on the relationship between the health of a city and the that of its citizens: what Bengaluru must rethink to secure a healthier future. The session will also include a talk by\u00a0Nachiket Mor,\u00a0Economist & Health Systems Researcher. \nThe discussion will be followed by an audience Q&A. \nThe Bengaluru Debates: A BIC\u2013Janaagraha Dialogue Series on Urban Governance in Bengaluru and Beyond\u00a0aims to expand civic space in the city by fostering conversations through a civic lens. The series is designed to be informative, constructive, and entertaining, while also serving as a trigger for local community action. Its objective is to bridge the gap between policy, practice, and public discourse on urban governance challenges, and to catalyse citizen and policymaker engagement towards systemic solutions. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nJanaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, founded in 2001 in Bengaluru, is dedicated to transforming the quality of life in India\u2019s cities and towns. Their mission is to strengthen the systems of urban governance so that cities can deliver clean, green, safe, and liveable environments for all citizens. For them, \u201cquality of life\u201d is not only about infrastructure and services, but equally about responsive institutions, citizen engagement, and transparent, data-driven governance. \n",

    "description": "Narratives illuminate what often lies just out of sight. \nIn this exciting conversation, Amitav Ghosh discusses his latest book, Ghost-Eye, with writer Anjum Hasan, tracing the hidden histories and environmental undercurrents that shape human lives. Moving between folklore and the contemporary world, the discussion explores how landscapes remember, how ecological forces linger beneath the visible, and how storytelling can recover what modern life trains us to ignore. \nHasan\u2019s thoughtful questioning bring out the novel\u2019s deeper concerns: the fragile relationship between people and place, the quiet violence of erasure, and the role of curiosity in resisting indifference. Together, they reflect on how narrative can sharpen our awareness of a planet in flux, and why attentiveness to history, to ecology, and to the unseen, matters now more than ever. \nA chance to hear directly from one of the most compelling literary voices about the inspirations behind his work and the urgent questions it raises.  \nPresented by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Hidden within Gujarat\u2019s landscape is the living memory of the malunga: a sacred musical bow of the African-Indian Sidi community, whose sound carries histories of migration, faith, and resilience. This event opens a rare window into a niche cultural world in India, where music is not performance alone, but inheritance. Through documentary and dialogue, it introduces the Sidis as Sufi Muslims of the Rifa\u2019i tariqa, rooted in the spiritual lineage of Bava Gor, the fourteenth-century saint from Nubia who journey and settled in India. \nThe evening begins with a screening of The Sidi Malunga Project: Rejuvenating the African Musical Bow in India (2002), by Amy Catlin-Jairazbhoy and Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy: a\u00a0film that documents not only the malunga\u2019s near-disappearance, but also captures the\u00a0extraordinary moment of revival\u00a0that brought elders and youth together to ensure its survival. The screening is followed by a presentation of the newly formed Sidi Culture and Heritage Trust, outlining ongoing efforts to sustain Sidi musical, spiritual, and cultural life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rare window into a living, resilient culture: a musical world few know, but many will remember. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Curiosity might have killed the cat, but it is the life of every scientific revolution. \nThis lecture celebrates the radical power of curiosity through the life and work of Michael Faraday, whose devotion to understanding nature for its own sake transformed how we see the physical world. Faraday\u2019s experiments with electricity and magnetism did more than solve isolated puzzles; they reshaped reality itself, laying the foundations for technologies that now define modern life. \nIn this talk, Arthur Eisenkraft traces the evolution of physics from early questions about electrostatics to the breakthroughs of \u00d8rsted, Faraday, and Maxwell, culminating in the birth of field theory. Along the way, he reflects on why curiosity-driven research (often dismissed as abstract or impractical) remains essential to innovation. \nAn invitation to rediscover wonder in scientific inquiry, this lecture speaks to anyone interested in how asking the right questions can change the world. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "A jugalbandi for the new age! \nThis Hindustani concert brings together three musicians whose journeys converge at the frontier that is Indo-jazz. Saxophonist Phill Scarff, long associated with cross-cultural explorations, meets Bengaluru-based slide guitarist Dr. Prakash Sontakke, whose fluid phrasing draws from Hindustani grammar while remaining open to contemporary sound worlds. Tabla maestro Gurumurthy Vaidya completes the trio, grounding the dialogue with rhythmic depth and supple responsiveness. \nWhat unfolds is a conversation through improvisation. The saxophone\u2019s burnished tone, the gliding resonance of the slide guitar, and the intricate play of taal move between structure and freedom, tradition and risk. Rooted in classical sensibility yet shaped by jazz\u2019s openness, the music charts a shared space where genres blur, listening deepens, and new possibilities quietly emerge. \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Neeli Parad\u00e9 is a curated showcase of short films by Bahujan filmmakers under Neelavarana. The program celebrates Bahujan lives and experiences while creating a space for meaningful engagement with the filmmakers through conversations and discussions. \nFollowing the screening, the filmmakers will be in conversation with the audience, moderated by Apeksha Singegol. The session will be in Kannada. \nFilm Schedule: \nSong of Ghetto \u2013 Keri Haadu | 33 minutes | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 |\u00a0Chandrashekara K \nIt\u2019s a film that documents the aftermath of a revolutionary protest that took place in Dindguru, a village in Karnataka. The event that sparked this revolution was when a man was not allowed to enter a coffee shop because he was a Dalit. This is unfortunately the case in every village in India. Caste is woven into the very fabric of the nation, an inescapable foe. \nThe Dalit Ghettos in Dindguru and the neighbouring village organised their movement against casteism. While the movement was successful, they now had to face the consequences of this protest. This is what the film captures, the state, stories of and resilience of the people and the many shapes and forms it takes. For those living in this ghetto, survival itself has become a form of resistance. The film captures the everydayness of this resistance as well as the everydayness of oppression. \nHalgi Naadha | 8 minutes 27 seconds | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 |\u00a0Mahishaa and Bharath Dingri \nThe Tamte is everywhere in India except in its cultural institutions. Sounding through life\u2019s most important moments of celebration and mourning, the instrument remains marginalised because of the caste of those who play it. Through the journey of Bharath Dingri, a generational Tamte artist, this documentary follows a quiet yet radical rebellion to challenge caste-based exclusion. By reimagining Tamte through workshops and pedagogy, Bharath asserts its place within India\u2019s classical arts and works to restore dignity to its players. \nBabasaheb in Bangalore | 4 minutes 22 seconds | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 |\u00a0Mahishaa \nBengaluru is a metropolitan city but you can\u2019t escape the imagery of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar as a sign of assertion from India\u2019s subaltern Marginalized castes. Statues are built by the blood and sweat of the people. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar or Babasaheb as his admirers affectionately call him has the most number of statues in India but the interesting fact is that none of these are built by the government like other statues. The film is a dedication to the people who have kept the philosophy of Dr. B R Ambedkar alive through his statues, we hear from the filmmaker and young people in the city & their relationship with these images. \nCase & Bobbin \u2013 Casu Mathu Bobbin | 6 minutes 33 seconds | Kannada with English subtitles |\u00a0Bharath Raj \nIn the heart of Bengaluru\u2019s thriving garment industry, Shankuntala, Munira Banu, and Vijayamma work tirelessly in factories where the clothes of multinational brands are produced. While their labor is the backbone of the global fashion world, their lives are far from the glamorous image the industry projects. Enduring long hours, meager wages, and grueling working conditions, these women navigate a world defined by sacrifice and struggle, with little hope for work-life balance or personal fulfillment. \nTheir stories are a reflection of the millions of women in the industry who face similar challenges, yet continue to press on with remarkable resilience. Amidst the harsh reality, it is the dream of a better future for their children that keeps them going. Through their personal journeys, this documentary reveals the strength, endurance, and quiet defiance of women who fight not only for survival, but for dignity and hope. \nIn collaboration with: \nNeelavarana \nNeelavarana is a Bengaluru-based Ambedkarite production house and artist collective working primarily in the Kannada language. Engaging in counter-cultural practice through Dalit-Bahujan aesthetics, the collective produces films, music, and cultural events while nurturing artists from marginalized communities. Through collaboration, mentorship, and community-driven processes, Neelavarana creates spaces where Dalit and Adivasi voices can tell their own stories, challenge dominant narratives, and reclaim cultural expression. \n \n",

    "description": "Sunil Mohan\u2019s memoir is a deeply reflective account of transition that moves beyond the familiar arc of before-and-after. Writing with honesty and quiet courage, Sunil traces a lifelong knowing of self alongside a persistent questioning of gender, masculinity, and belonging. \nAs he transitions from being read as female to male, the book resists easy definitions, asking how one might claim manhood without surrendering to narrow, socially sanctioned models of masculinity. Rather than centring pain alone, the narrative turns outward: to the queer, trans, anti-caste, feminist, and people\u2019s movements that have shaped Sunil\u2019s political and emotional world. It reflects on friendship, resistance, silence, healing, and the strength found in sharing our struggle. \nIn this conversation, Sunil Mohan will be joined by\u00a0contemporary inventive Dalit writer\u00a0Dr. Gogu Shyamala\u00a0and\u00a0Assistant Professor at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Reshma Bharadwaj\u00a0to reflect on the book\u2019s themes, the politics of becoming, and the quiet pride of living with integrity. Urvashi Butalia, founder of Zubaan books will throw light on feminist publishing around queer histories and narratives. \nThis book emerged as part of a research study on \u2018De-Constructing Masculinities,\u2019\u00a0 by maraa, a media and arts collective, supported by Edelgive Foundation. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",
