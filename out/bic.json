Understanding Lutherie gives us a glimpse into a very different world \u2013 one that combines design, deep understanding of tone and timbre and the manner in which every part of a guitar affects them, extreme respect for details and more details, the love of wood and mastery over craftsmanship of wood \u2013 a world of limitless possibilities, where no two instruments are ever alike. \nThis is the story of a pair of luthier-made instruments, a Bass and a Guitar; the passion and love that created them and the extraordinary relationship between Luthier and Musician they are based upon . \nThis session provides a\u00a0glimpse into an art and a craft that has immense intricacies and of which very, very few people (including guitar players) are aware. Vinoo Matthew will demonstrate to people that there are no limits to intricacy and detail in anything one might choose to do \u2013\u00a0handmade\u00a0garments to surgery to corporate governance. \nThe talk will be followed by a performance by the Sarpajur Blues Band, a duo consisting of Vinoo Matthew on electric guitar and Shekhar Seshadri on acoustic guitar.\u00a0The Sarjapur Blues Band (SBB) is an underground, eclectic, backstreet, workingmen\u2019s, original,\u00a0rhythm and blues band \n",

From building a thriving silk and garment empire to exploring law, organic farming, and philosophy, he approached every pursuit with passion and purpose. Even in adversity, he found meaning, drawing strength from the wisdom of D.V. Gundappa and Tolstoy. To him, business, literature, and spirituality were not separate paths but part of a single journey. This memorial lecture honours a life lived with conviction, curiosity, and an unyielding spirit. \nPresented by: Sriram Devatha. \n",

    "description": "The early medieval period in South Karnataka was a time of vigorous cultural change. Between the 10th and 13th centuries CE, it became a frontier region between the sprawling Chola and Chalukya empires, allowing for migration, the development of new trade networks, and the rise of innovative temple cultures. Tamil peasant-warriors and traders settled in South Karnataka, significantly contributing to the region\u2019s already cosmopolitan character\u2014an influence still visible in the temple architecture of Bengaluru and its vicinity. The Chola presence also introduced new models of royal power that shaped the emerging Hoysala dynasty. Drawing on architectural, art historical, and epigraphical material, Anirudh Kanisetti examines the Chola impact on South Karnataka and how it continues to shape Bengaluru\u2019s urbanism today. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n",

Mystics, poets and saints spanning many centuries and regions have extensively used the metaphor of the clay pot to talk about the fragility of the human body and the enormous possibilities of human existence. \nIn this performance titled The Universe in a Pot, musicians Sumana and Saitejas bring together a sonic and a lyrical experience centred around the simple clay pot. The performance takes the audience on a musical journey that blends together the diverse soundscapes that are possible on this simple yet powerful instrument, along with songs, stories and poetry of the mystics that celebrate the pot. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "English | 73 mins | India | 2025 \nIn an era where our lives increasingly depend on satellites for everything from communication to weather forecasting, The Dirty Sky delves into the escalating crisis of orbital debris \u2013 the uncontrolled trash accumulating in space. Through a detailed exploration of the history of satellite launches, the film sheds light on the exponential increase in non-functional satellites, leading to a severe threat to our orbital environment and space sustainability. It underscores the growing dangers posed by orbital debris, which, much like terrestrial pollution, is an unseen but pervasive threat to space activities. The Dirty Sky emphasizes the urgency for global awareness and action. It advocates for the public and world leaders to raise a concerted voice, urging competing nations and commercial companies to take concrete steps before our beautiful sky becomes as uninhabitable as the polluted seas and air on Earth \u2013 the only home humanity has. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A session with the filmmaker. \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "The fiercest wars are fought between siblings. \nTara, a successful Delhi lawyer, is everything her younger brother isn\u2019t: dedicated, independent, thriving. When their beloved father retires, he summons them to a meeting. But what he has to say threatens to tear the family apart. Tara\u2019s friend Lila has it all: a great job, a lovely home, a beautiful family. \nBut when Lila\u2019s father dies unexpectedly, her brother wastes no time in claiming what he thinks is his. Together, Tara and Lila are forced to confront the challenge that their ambition poses to patriarchal Delhi society. Set against a backdrop of ecological collapse and political unrest, The Tiger\u2019s Share is both a family and a state-of-the-nation novel. \nThe Tiger\u2019s Share, Keshava Guha\u2019s incisive new novel unravels sibling rivalries set against the backdrop of a rapidly changing India. Guha\u2019s storytelling transforms personal conflicts into a lens for examining societal upheavals \u2013 from shifting family loyalties to the pressures of urban ambition. \nIn this session, Keshava Guha will be in conversation with novelist and playwright, Vivek Shanbhag. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \n",
