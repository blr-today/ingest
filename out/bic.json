    "description": "What happens when the language we speak no longer fits who we are, or when it never quite did? \nIn this thought-provoking talk, writer and translator Rita Kothari invites us to reflect on the hidden languages of our lives: the ones we speak at home, inherit from our families, or carry quietly within us. While English may dominate our public conversations, Kothari reminds us that it rarely stands alone. Beneath its surface are other tongues, shaping how we think, feel, and belong. \nDrawing from personal stories and cultural insight, she explores how linguistic expression is deeply tied to identity and power. From subtle shifts in pronunciation to bold acts of embracing or rejecting a language, Kothari highlights how marginalised communities use language to resist dominant norms.\u00a0 \nKothari challenges us to see language not just as a system of grammar and rules, but as lived experience; fluid, intimate, and political. In doing so, she calls for a more inclusive understanding of how we speak and listen to one another. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session, offering space for conversation and reflection with your questions, your stories, and your own layers of language. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Experience an unforgettable evening of music and memory with a special vinyl listening session of Kadahin Milandaasin, the acclaimed album by drummer and composer Tarun Balani. Called \u201ca sonic love letter to Sindh\u201d by The Hindu, this deeply personal work has been featured on NPR\u2019s Best Jazz Albums and Bandcamp\u2019s Best of Jazz. \nInspired by the life of Balani\u2019s late grandfather, K.S. Balani, a renowned Sindhi writer and painter, the album explores themes of migration, ancestral memory, and identity. Through moving compositions and layered soundscapes, Kadahin Milandaasin becomes both a tribute and a journey home. \nThe evening includes a full vinyl playback of the album, followed by an intimate conversation with Tarun Balani himself. Join us for a rare chance to hear the stories behind the music: of love, loss, and legacy.\u00a0 \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences. Through this initiative, we collaborate with various venues, extending the reach of our events beyond our own space. These partnerships not only breathe life into our gatherings but also play a crucial role in cultivating an environment for the flourishing of arts and culture in the city. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Experience the drama, passion, and romance of opera in a concert featuring timeless masterpieces from Bizet\u2019s Carmen, Verdi\u2019s La Traviata, and Gounod\u2019s Romeo and Juliet! \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra will be led by India-born Danish conductor Maria Badstue, and joined by stellar soloists\u2014Indian-American tenor Alok Kumar and soprano Cheryl Bains. This concert brings the emotional power of grand opera to life in Bengaluru. \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra brings together talented musicians from across the region to foster peace and unity through music. Inspired by Ambassador Nirupama Menon Rao\u2019s extensive years in diplomacy, the orchestra provides a platform to promote dialogue, cultural synergy, and friendly understanding. \nNirupama Rao,\u00a0Founder/ Trustee of The South Asian Symphony Foundation says, \u201cThere is something profoundly symbolic about an orchestra. It is more than a group of musicians gathered to perform a piece of music; it is a living metaphor for what society could be \u2014 and perhaps what it must be, if we are to thrive together\u2026\u00a0This metaphor becomes even more powerful in today\u2019s world, where individualism often overshadows community, and noise threatens to replace music. The orchestra reminds us that true greatness lies not in volume, but in harmony \u2014 in listening, adapting, and playing our part with care and respect.\u201d \n \n\u00a0 \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  \n",

    "description": "Isn\u2019t love just the most beautiful illusion? \nAll About Nothing is a powerful solo performance that blends story, movement, and music into a poetic look at how romantic love shapes the way we see the world. Through the lens of maya, or illusion, this deeply personal piece asks: what happens when we build our lives around feelings that may not be real? \nTold through a quiet, intimate dialogue between two artists, the performance gently unravels the roles, emotions, and routines we often cling to. With honesty and grace, it explores what lies beneath it all, and the freedoms that might be found in letting go. \nRooted in the spirit of Butoh master Kazuo Ohno\u2019s words, \u201cYou must have life coming out of you (your art),\u201d this work is not simply performed, but lived. \nAll About Nothing offers both tenderness and confrontation, inviting you to reflect on your own attachments through questions of what you hold dear, and why. \nCredits:\nWritten & Conceptualized by: Archana S Kumar, India\nOriginal Soundscore: Kamal Singh, Bangalore, India\nDramaturgy & Lighting: Sal Yusuf, UK | India (Black Box India) \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "What happens when two classical dance forms meet on the same stage? \nRooted in tradition, yet distinct in rhythm and grace, the fourth evening of Dual Margam brings together two iconic forms: the flowing, emotive elegance of Mohiniyattam from Kerala, and the sculptural strength and expressive clarity of Odissi from Odisha. \nEach solo performance offers a glimpse into the soul of its tradition\u2014Mohiniyattam with its gentle, circular grace; Odissi with its striking lines and powerful storytelling. The evening culminates in a duet, weaving these two styles into a graceful confluence, illuminating their shared roots and individual brilliance in a spellbinding visual dialogue. \nWhether you\u2019re a longtime admirer of classical dance or simply curious, this is a rare chance to experience movement as language, emotion, and shared heritage. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",

Presented by Chinmayi Nrithyalaya and directed by Guru Sridevi Chalagalla Mungara, this Kuchipudi dance-drama brings Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s poignant writing to life. \nThis emotional and spiritual journey of identity, longing, and liberation unfolds beautifully through Kuchipudi\u2019s deeply expressive vocabulary. Graceful movement, rhythmic command, and layered abhinaya, portray the character\u2019s awakening from inherited exclusion to personal agency with an emotional depth only dance can invoke . \nPerformed in Telugu with English narration, Chandalika is easy to follow and hard to forget! \nPresented by: \n \n",

present times from P. Lankesh\u2019s original \u201cKranthi Banthu Kranthi\u201d, first published in 1971. Although there has been a significant shift in the political and social climate, the fact that the roots of these issues have remained constant makes it feel almost natural. The original play, written during an era when socialism, communism and revolution were at their peak, still manages to capture and reflect the present political and social order. Team Kalavilasi has adapted the original to fit today\u2019s scenario, making it more relatable to the current generation while being mindful of the play\u2019s complex and sensitive aspects. \nThe play explores pressing issues such as the tyranny of capitalists, systemic interference, the opportunistic behavior of influencers for personal gain, the outrage of disempowered youth, the flood of opinions on social media, and how the media capitalizes on these dynamics. It engages the audience with these timely themes. \nThe question of what is right or wrong is subjective. Throughout the play, the characters make decisions they believe to be right, only to become trapped in the system\u2019s nuances, sparking curiosity in the audience. Woven with humor and satire, the play offers ample entertainment while provoking thought. \nCast and Crew | \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c97\u0ca3 \u0cae\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0ca4\u0cc1 \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0c82\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0c95 \u0cac\u0cb3\u0c97: \nVaishnavi | \u0cb5\u0cc8\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cb5\u0cbf\nMadhukar Hirisave | \u0cae\u0ca7\u0cc1\u0c95\u0cb0\u0ccd \u0cb9\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0cb8\u0cbe\u0cb5\u0cc6\nSiddaramu K | \u2060\u0cb8\u0cbf\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0ca6\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cc1 \u0c95\u0cc6\nNamitha Ramu | \u2060\u0ca8\u0cae\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cbe \u0cb0\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cc1\nPallavi Hegde | \u2060\u0caa\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cb5\u0cbf \u0cb9\u0cc6\u0c97\u0ca1\u0cc6\nHarsha Vardhan | \u2060\u0cb9\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb7 \u0cb5\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0ca7\u0ca8\u0ccd\nNarayan Badiger | \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0caf\u0ca3\u0ccd \u0cac\u0ca1\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc7\u0cb0\u0ccd\nNagaraj | \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0c97\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c9c\u0ccd\nSuhas Srinivas | \u0cb8\u0cc1\u0cb9\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ccd \u0cb6\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cc0\u0ca8\u0cbf\u0cb5\u0cbe\u0cb8\u0ccd\nAbhishek Chakrannavar | \u0c85\u0cad\u0cbf\u0cb7\u0cc7\u0c95 \u0c9a\u0c95\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0ca3\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cb5\u0cb0\nAbhinav Iyengar | \u0c85\u0cad\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0cb5\u0ccd \u0c85\u0caf\u0ccd\u0caf\u0c82\u0c97\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0ccd \nBackground Music | \u0cb9\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0cc6 \u0cb8\u0c82\u0c97\u0cc0\u0ca4 : Sathya Radhakrishna | \u0cb8\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0caf \u0cb0\u0cbe\u0ca7\u0cbe\u0c95\u0cc3\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0ca3\nLighting Design | \u0cac\u0cc6\u0cb3\u0c95\u0cc1 \u0cb5\u0cbf\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0caf\u0cbe\u0cb8 : Manju Narayan | \u0cae\u0c82\u0c9c\u0cc1 \u0ca8\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0caf\u0ca3 & Surya | \u0cb8\u0cc2\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0caf\nCo-ordinator | \u0cb0\u0c82\u0c97 \u0ca8\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cb9\u0ca3\u0cc6 : Basavaraj Emmiyavar | \u0cac\u0cb8\u0cb5\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c9c \u0c8e\u0cae\u0ccd\u0cae\u0cbf\u0caf\u0cb5\u0cb0 \n\n\nSupported by:\n\n",

Ferdinand Kittel (1832 \u2013 1903) was a missionary from Germany, who spent 50 years of his life between India and Germany on his work as a writer, translator, linguist and lexicographer. This period film takes up the journey of his monumental work in the fields of lexicography and philology. Despite many challenges, he mastered the Kannada language and created a huge dictionary and thesaurus unparalleled in any Indian language. He also taught in schools and produced more than 40 scholarly works. \nThis tri-lingual, non-fiction film is shot in locations where Kittel lived and worked both in southern India and Germany, and its first person narration uses his letters to his children in Germany, and letters and reports to superiors. It includes archival photographs dating back to the early 19th century, folk songs and poems written and translated by Kittel, and Old Kannada literature. The film has been shown in different parts of Switzerland, Germany & India. \nDuring the production of the film, one of the early print typefaces of Kannada, pioneered by Kittel and cast in Europe was digitised by the filmmaker, Prashant Pandit, and an open-source font in the name of Kittel was released for public use. This font was extensively used in the books published during the 1860s. The film also uses this font in the displayed texts. \nImage Credit\nHeader: Erstwhile Basel Mission Printing Press, Mangaluru, a still from the film, The Word and the Teacher.\u00a0Ferdinand Kittel supervised the publication of numerous books at the Press. \nProduction Crew:\nDirector, Writer & Editor \u2013 Prashant Pandit\nCinematography \u2013 Chidanand GL & Florina Steiner\nSound \u2013 Anand V & Mahaveer S \n",

    "description": "Contradictions, comparison and ultimately confluence, Dvaita | Duality\u00a0is a fusion of artistic expression and philosophical inquiry. Through two distinct dance forms, Kuchipudi and Balinese, the dynamic balance of opposing energies is beautifully displayed. \nCentred around \u2018Ardhanareeswara\u2019, the composite form of Shiva-Shakti, the dance visualises the distinct yet complementary nature of the masculine and feminine energies. A layered performance, this piece explores the philosophical questions of how our consciousness (Purusha) interacts with the material world (Prakriti). \nThis evening aspires to resolve the paradox of opposites not through negotiation, but harmonious expression. \nCredits: \nConcept, Creation and Artistic Direction: Gomathi Boorada \nDancers:\nGomathi Boorada\nJesitta Jilju\nNeharika Renjith Nair\nHemali Subramanyam Boorada\nAlphonsa Ashwajit Kamble\nSneha Chandrababu\nGoutham Maheswaran\n\u2060Ni Putu Widiantini\n\u2060Ni Wayan Pia Wahyuni\n\u2060Ni Komang Erna Sriwahyuni\n\u2060Ni Kadek Santi Wiadnyani \nMusic:\nI Wayan Sudirana / Gamelan Yugananda\nD.S.V.

    "description": "Some moments in life invite us to pause; to breathe, to listen, and to simply exist. \nSet in the calm of a late morning, this intimate Hindustani classical concert is a quiet space to step away from the rush of daily life. The gentle interplay of voice, tanpura, tabla, and harmonium creates a soundscape that invites you inward, toward reflection and balance. \nThe morning ragas chosen for this performance are rooted in centuries-old traditions. Each note is crafted with care to awaken clarity, soft energy, and a renewed sense of presence. Guided by accomplished vocalists who carry forward the rich legacy of Hindustani classical music, the concert becomes more than a performance; it becomes a meditative journey. \nCome as you are. Let the music meet you there. Before the world fully stirs, allow yourself this gift of stillness, where melody and rhythm become gentle reminders of the peace already within you.  \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "For centuries, Tibet has remained a land of mystery. Though sacred to millions, Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar, were still wrapped in myth as recent as the 1900\u2019s. This session retraces the journey of two travelers, a Swedish explorer and an Indian ascetic, whose visits illuminated the mythical and sacred Kailash-Manasarovar region in Tibet. \nBetween 1907 and 1909, Swedish explorer Sven Hedin mapped the region. He traced the sources of the three great rivers \u2013 the Brahmaputra, Indus, and Sutlej \u2013 and became the first European to walk around Mount Kailash. Three decades later, Indian monk Swami Pranavananda arrived in the region. He offered a fresh view, challenging Hedin\u2019s identification of the rivers\u2019 sources, offering, for the first time, an informed Asian perspective on Tibet\u2019s geography. \nThis visually rich talk brings their stories to life. Rare archival material, contemporary photos, and new research reveal how these journeys shaped our understanding of a sacred landscape. \nThe Q&A after the session offers room for your participation \u2013 whether curious about history, travel, or sacred places. \n",

    "description": "Why does welfare feel out of reach for so many, even as governments promise more than ever? \nWelfare schemes and cash transfers are central to India\u2019s political economy today. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2025) recounts the crucial history of how welfare has evolved in India over the past century. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day, the book asks important questions, illuminates failures and brings clarity to our murky future. \nAuthor Louise Tillin in conversation with Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan, moderated by Arun Thiruvengadam, will explore what India\u2019s welfare journey means for citizens, workers, and voters today. \nCurious about where your taxes go, or why support doesn\u2019t always reach those who need it most? Stay for the Q&A and bring your questions. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair, NLS.\u00a0 \n",

From Bangalore\u2019s storied publishing lanes to secretive religious enclaves, Romig\u2019s reporting traces the forces threatening democracy\u2014and the people risking everything to resist them. \nThis event offers a rare window into the human cost of political violence, the courage of those who speak truth to power, and the urgent question: how do we stop the spread of hatred before it turns deadly? \nDon\u2019t miss this conversation at the intersection of journalism, politics, and justice. \n",

    "description": "Assistant Commissioner of Police (Retd) Madhukar B. Zende is best-known for his sensational arrest of the serial murderer Charles Sobhraj, aka the Serpent. He is also lauded for successfully managing the violent riots in Mumbai that broke out in the aftermath of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1993, and ushering in an era of peace. \nBut Zende has many more stories of crime and justice under his belt, and in the book, Mumbai\u2019s Most Wanted, he gives readers a glimpse into what it meant to be a cop in the seventies and eighties. From the puzzling case of the murder of Shanta Devi to the kidnapping of a famous movie mogul to the capture of dark luminaries like Arun Gawli, Karim Lala, Haji Mastan and Babu Reshim, this session will explore the riveting account of a super cop who brought some of the city\u2019s most dreaded villains to their knees. \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "The solitude of the night-time has always been a space where humans release their innermost thoughts, whether of comfort, terror, liberation, wistfulness or hope. As such, many of the finest works of art have been inspired by its thrall. Karl Lutchmayer\u2019s recital discusses and presents some powerful emotional responses to the darkness by a quintet of composer-pianists who represent a pantheon of Romantic and Modernist ethea. From yearning lullabies, intimate reminiscences, and nocturnal soundscapes to religious ecstasy, and gothic horror, each showcases the extraordinary resources of the piano and the technical and emotional range of the pianist\u2019s art. \n \n\u00a0 \nImage Credit: \nThumbnail, Header and Poster: Photos of Karl Lutchmayer by Param Singh \n\u00a0 \nPresented by the International Music and Arts Society \n \n\u00a0 \nWith the support of Furtados and Steinway \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\u00a0 \nThe International Music and Arts Society gratefully acknowledges the support of Shashi Uthappa and V Natarajan. \n",

    "description": "Folie \u00e0 Deux \nSome connections run so deep, they blur the line between two minds, two lives, until they begin to move as one. Folie \u00e0 Deux, French for \u201ca shared madness\u201d or \u201cshared state of mind,\u201d captures this rare intimacy. \nThe program features two evocative contemporary dance solos: \u201c3 AM\u201d and \u201cNobody Cares.\u201d Together, these performances invite you into that in-between space where stories overlap, emotions echo, and movement speaks what words often cannot. \nTitle: Nobody Cares \nIn \u201cNobody Cares,\u201d Deepak Kurki confronts identity in a world shaped by contradiction. His piece explores the dissonance of social labels and inherited expectations of an individual born in a Hindu family, raised in a Muslim neighborhood, and educated in a Catholic school. Through raw, physical language, Deepak questions the systems that define us\u2014and the quiet resistance that emerges from within. \nCredits: \nChoreographed & Performed by Deepak Kurki Shivaswamy \nMusic: Abhijeet Tambe \nDuration: 30 minutes \n\u00a0 \nTitle: 3 AM \nIn \u201c3 AM,\u201d Prashant More takes us into the restless mind of an insomniac. The piece traces the delicate edge between exhaustion and wakefulness\u2014a world where time dissolves, and the mind spirals through memory, anxiety, and longing. It\u2019s a quiet, surreal portrait of sleeplessness, told through a body caught in motion while desperately searching for stillness. \nCredits: \nChoreography and Performance: Prashant More Music: Nikhil Nagaraj \nDuration: 35 minutes \nSupported by: \n \n",
