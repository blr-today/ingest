    "description": "Oftentimes, the most powerful revolutions begin in verse. \nWith stirring narratives and emotional melodies, Mukti \u2013 Liberation in Song invites audiences to embark on an introspective journey, guided by the verses of poets who dared to dream beyond boundaries. The programme juxtaposes live performances of classical and folk compositions in multiple languages with immersive narration. Enhanced by a simulcast slideshow that spotlights the rich tapestry of Indian poetry, this event explores the perennial quest for freedom. \nFrom Tyagaraja\u2019s desire to break free from worldly attachments to Akka Mahadevi\u2019s defiance of patriarchal norms, each performance encapsulates a unique facet of liberation. Basavanna and Chokkamela\u2019s verses resonate with resistance against caste barriers, advocating universal equality. Kabir\u2019s timeless words soar with a similar spirit, calling upon souls to shatter dogmatic chains. \nThis evening, we honor the enduring spirit of Mukti and celebrate the poets whose voices envisioned a world where freedom isn\u2019t just a political concept, but a universally human truth. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Scholars of international relations, political thought, and India\u2019s diplomatic history continue to debate the meaning and relevance of non-alignment in India\u2019s foreign policy today. The origins of these debates lie in Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s articulation of non-alignment at the height of the Cold War, a concept both resolute and ambiguous. \nIn this talk, Dr. Swapna Kona Nayudu will draw on her acclaimed book, The Nehru Years: An International History of Indian Non-Alignment (Cambridge University Press UK, Juggernaut Books India), to explore how India\u2019s approach to international affairs and the United Nations now understood in summary as non-alignment. Based on meticulous archival research in multiple languages, her work uncovers India\u2019s diplomatic and peacekeeping contributions in pivotal global events such as the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Hungarian Revolution, and the Congo Crisis. \nTracing the evolution of non-alignment from Nehru\u2019s time to the present, Dr. Kona Nayudu will examine its contested meaning and its influence on India\u2019s position as the only non-aligned founding member of the UN. \nDr. Kona Nayudu will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

In this session, they will reflect on the choices they have made: to amplify certain voices, to tell different stories with care, and to avoid reducing complex truths into simplified narratives. \nAt the heart of this conversation is a shared responsibility; not only as writers, educators, or artists, but as individuals shaped by inherited memory.

Kids will dance through their moods, draw out their feelings, and playfully explore what it means to be calm, frustrated, or excited. \nAlongside, parents will discover tools to better understand their child\u2019s emotional world and connect more deeply. There will be space for questions and discussions on child behaviour. \nAll materials are provided, including colours, worksheets, and take-home resources. \nWith calming breath-work, openhearted conversations, and creative activities, this 90-minute session turns emotional learning into a shared family story.

In this timely and wide-ranging session, Peter Varghese, former Australian Foreign Secretary and High Commissioner to India, offers a perspective shaped by decades of diplomacy and deep engagement with the region. \nHis address will explore the complex forces redefining the Indo-Pacific: from the sharpening rivalry between the US and China, to China\u2019s expanding influence and the evolving policy direction in Washington. The session will also examine how key regional players (India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia) are shaping their own responses to these pressures, and what this means for the broader security of the region. \nAlongside geopolitics, the conversation will turn to trade tensions, economic nationalism, and the slowing pace of globalization; factors that now cast long shadows over our economic future. Can traditional regional institutions hold, or will more agile, interest-based minilateral groups take their place? \nFollowing his presentation, Peter Varghese will converse with Latha Reddy, Nitin Pai, and Ranjan Mathai. The evening concludes with an audience Q&A, inviting reflections on a region that will shape the 21st century. \n",

    "description": "Language: English \nWhen the rules of love are rewritten, what\u2019s left standing? \nDario Fo\u2019s The Open Couple is a bold, sharp, and darkly comic exploration of modern relationships pushed to the edge. What begins as a provocative experiment (a husband proposing an open marriage) quickly spirals into chaos, confrontation, and unexpected revelations. \nSet against the backdrop of shifting gender roles and social expectations, the play peels back the layers of a marriage unravelling. With biting wit and disarming vulnerability, Fo exposes the emotional toll of jealousy, the absurdity of control, and the fragile line between freedom and fear. The couple\u2019s battles are fast, funny, and painfully familiar, as they try to navigate the messy terrain of love, power, and identity. \nThrough its rapid dialogue and theatrical twists, The Open Couple holds up a mirror to our ideas of commitment and connection; asking what we\u2019re really seeking when we ask for more. \nA deeply human comedy that leaves room for both laughter and reckoning. \nCredits:\nWriter : Dario Fo\nDirector : Faraz Khan\nCreative Producer : Ragini Roychowdhury\nActors : Vaishali Bisht & Rohan Joshi\nSound : Charvi Ojha \nSupported by:\n \n",

Originally launched online in 2022 by ReReeti in partnership with the British Council and Glasgow Life Museums, this exhibition is now being reimagined as a physical, immersive experience. It is especially relevant for young people who have only ever encountered Partition through textbook chapters and distorted narratives. \nCurated by ReReeti, designed by Aditi Dhamija, and in collaboration with the Bangalore International Centre, this exhibition urges participants to deeply feel the emotional weight of forced, mass migration. The digital interactives serve as the core touch point, but the stories extend beyond the screen. Spilling into the physical space as tactile, atmospheric, and visually compelling encounters, visitors navigate through stories of displacement \u2013 stories based on real accounts of families. You will face difficult choices on behalf of characters, driven by fear, survival, and the need to protect their families. \nWhile Partition impacted families across the subcontinent, its realities are often distant in southern India. This exhibition opens space for reflection and conversation, prompting visitors to connect personally with questions of identity, loss, memory, and inter-generational resilience. \nThe hope is to change how future generations choose to carry our history forward. \nPlease note: Kids below age 6 will not be allowed inside the Gallery space. \nClick here to know more about the Panel Discussion. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n\u00a0 \n",

When our children focus on rote learning and exam-based academic progress, how do we nurture the inventive Indian who can fuel the imagination of the world with creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving? What if classrooms became labs of imagination, not factories of repetition? \nThese are the questions that the Agastya International Foundation set out to answer 25 years ago, by designing a curiosity-driven, experiential learning model that has transformed education across India. Today, their vision of sparking curiosity, nurturing creativity and instilling confidence and caring has impacted over 25 million schoolchildren and 300,000 teachers in government schools across 23 Indian States. \nAn acclaimed new book from Penguin Random House, The Moving of Mountains traces Agastya\u2019s extraordinary journey in reshaping the classroom by replacing rote learning with hands-on experiments, creative projects and interactive models in science, art and ecology. \nJoin us in a discussion of why this powerful vision for curiosity-driven, experiential learning is critical to the future of India, and has caught the imagination of scientists, industry leaders, educationists and policy makers alike. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n",

    "description": "Insider accounts from political aides, bureaucrats, and diplomats have long illuminated the workings of power\u2014but even more enigmatic were the lobbyists. Operating in the shadows, often invisible to public scrutiny, they were intimately privy to clandestine negotiations, back-channel discussions, and subtle bureaucratic skirmishes. In his new roman-\u00e0-clef For No Reason At All, Ramjee Chandran shines a light on this hidden world. \nChandran\u2014well\u2011known in Bangalore as a journalist, publisher, and podcaster\u2014has, until now, remained silent about his time as a lobbyist in 1980s New Delhi, a pivotal era just before major economic reforms took hold. \nDrawing from real events, the novel charts the journey of a young lobbyist caught in a high-stakes conflict over silicon metal\u2014a material deemed strategically vital. Central to the drama is Metkem Silicon, which, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, devoted 17 years to developing indigenous silicon metal technology. Yet their efforts collided with a rival scheme spearheaded by the Department of Electronics, which wanted to bypass local innovation and import U.S. technology. \nWhat ensued was a four\u2011year bureaucratic war: media leaks, secret memorandums, and the covert involvement of the Soviets and other intelligence agencies\u2014culminating in a final decision placed in the hands of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. \nSet against the backdrop of Cold War Delhi on the cusp of liberalisation, the novel paints a vivid portrait of a nation\u2014and capital\u2014torn between ideologies and ambitions. The Soviet Union may have vanished, lobbyists have receded from public corridors, and few can claim first\u2011hand knowledge of that era. \nIn Confessions of a Lobbyist, Siddharth Raja\u2014a lawyer, historian, and bibliophile\u2014sits down with Ramjee Chandran to peel back the layers of this story, offering an insider\u2019s glimpse into a world that feels at once distant and disarmingly relevant. \n",

    "description": "A daring literary experiment, explored through the eyes of the author herself! \nThis evening authors Meena Kandasamy and Sam Arni will delve into the innovative split-screen structure of Kandasamy\u2019s revolutionary book, Exquisite Cadavers. Together, they will discuss how experimentation of form confronts literary expectations, challenges the marginalization of writers from the Global South, and connects the intimate landscapes of relationships to broader public histories. \nUnlike a painter\u2019s or potter\u2019s studio where you can watch art come alive, the writer\u2019s creative process is usually hidden, mysterious, almost alchemical. Exquisite Cadavers is Meena Kandasamy\u2019s take on the novel-in-the-margins format. The story of Maya and Karim \u2013 lovers navigating the complexities of migration, racial identity, and political uncertainty in Brexit-era London \u2013 unfold only on half the pages. Juxtaposed with Kandasamy\u2019s candid reflections on her own life experiences, the book provides a unique view into a writer\u2019s process of creation. \nJoin us for a disarmingly honest conversation on polemics, protests, and power. \n",

    "description": "It\u2019s here. The climate crisis is no longer a distant warning.\u00a0 \nClimate Change: The Policy, Law, and Practice is a vital intervention. A book that gathers decades of global negotiations, Indian legal battles, and emerging climate jurisprudence into one urgent and accessible narrative. From courtroom precedents to cutting-edge policy, from carbon markets to constitutional rights, it examines how law can both shape and respond to the climate emergency. \nAuthor and legal expert Jay Cheema draws from his experience as Amicus Curiae to the Supreme Court of India in a landmark carbon emissions case. Guiding us through the evolving legal architecture of climate action and accountability, his presentation will be followed by an incisive conversation with an interlocutor to explore the tensions and hopes within the climate discourse. An open Q&A will close the session. \nReshaping landscapes, displacing lives, and challenging our very systems of governance, this crisis can no longer be sidelined. Forests burn where there was once monsoon green, rivers swell as glaciers retreat, and the ancient cycle of India\u2019s six ritus feels increasingly unfamiliar. The chaos predicted by climate scientists in the 50\u2019s is increasingly creeping into our reality.\u00a0 \nBecause the climate crisis is not only legal and political, but deeply personal. \n",

    "description": "Is populism a threat or a corrective to democracy? Can it be both and at the same time?\u00a0Is there an Indian Way of Populism? \nMuch public commentary on populists has been pulled in different directions, and it seems almost impossible that we can cohere out of this polarized conundrum and into a shared understanding (even if disagreement) of meanings and labels around this concept. What indeed is the role of Populism in political modernization, and its place in a democracy, beyond the Americas and Europe? \nPopulists are often understood in terms of who they are \u2013 rather who we think they are. This discussion will centre around a recent book \u201cA Logic of Populism: India and its States\u201d (Cambridge University Press 2025) that tries to understand populists in terms of what they do. Author, Srikrishna Ayyangar, argues that what populists do is to divide people, for the greater common good, and so who they are depends on political affiliations within the democratic context. Evoking the \u2018Indian way\u2019 inspired by A.K Ramanujan\u2019s celebrated essay that the title of this discussion draws from, Ashutosh Varshney and Mahesh Rangarajan along with Sudhir Krishnaswamy as the moderator will engage in a conversation around the book and the relevance of the theme to India\u2019s democracy.\u00a0 A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nTea will be served from 5 PM onwards. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Can you write poetry about non-human life that doesn\u2019t recall human life? If you\u2019ve ever tried, you know it\u2019s a feat of attention. There are few precedents. Japanese haikus come to mind as do short Sanskrit poems on bucolic animal and bird life. But these were exceptions even in their own literary contexts. \nYou don\u2019t have to read far into Chaucer\u2019s 14th century poem Parliament of Fowls to realize that the bird characters are metaphors for humans. This also applies to Farid ud-Din Attar\u2019s 12th century Persian Sufi classic, Conference of the Birds, as it does to the animal characters in the Sanskrit Hitopadesha. \nSiddhartha Menon\u2019s poetry belongs to a modern practice, going back to around 1900, of creating poems through spells of intense attention to non-human life for its own sake. This evening will begin with a conversation between Menon and Prashant Keshavmurthy on how two of Menon\u2019s six poem collections \u2013 The Compass Bird (2023) and Lone Pine (2025) \u2013 relate to this modern poetic practice. This will be followed by Menon\u2019s readings from these collections, another conversation and then a discussion with the audience. \n",
