    "description": "\nThis talk will reflect on broad trends in the study of caste including debates and discussions drawing on poststructuralist, Marxist, and anthropological approaches which have tended to approach caste as a distinctive form of hierarchy and social distinction. This framing will help to illuminate the challenge of new approaches and intellectual formations, which center critical caste and Dalit studies, scholarship on anticaste thought, and studies of global caste. \nHow does a politics of the present inflect social transformations of caste, as well as the resistance to its inequities? What are the potentials and the perils to studying caste through global fields of power and comparison? How might we bridge institutional logics and disciplinary constraints in effecting novel forms of critique? \nA Q&A session will follow the talk. \n\n",

    "description": "Dante Beyond Borders is an Italian Indian co-production born from the collaboration between Instabili Vaganti and Ahum Trust and inspired by the Divine Comedy of the great Italian Poet Dante Alighieri, on the occasion of his 700 years death\u2019s anniversary. \nThe performance explores different artistic languages: experimental theatre, dance, cinema, video art and electronic music in order to bring the spectator into the otherworldly journey made by Dante. The sounds of Dante\u2019s ancient Italian language meet the mudras and gestures of\u00a0 the traditional Bharatanatyam dance, accompanied by the contemporary electronic soundscapes originally composed by the Oscar winning Italian musician Riccardo Nanni, around the leading suggestion of the Absence, an element that permeates Dante\u2019s works. \nThe evocative physical actions of the performer Nicola Pianzola and the dance of Anuradha Venkataraman interact with the videos realised by the artists of the project through a remote collaboration developed during the lockdown. \nThe performance aims to explore the\u00a0 numerous connections between Dante\u2019s work and Indian culture, both from an iconographic, philosophical and theological point of view. \nDirection: Anna Dora Dorno\nDramaturgy: Anna Dora Dorno, Nicola Pianzola\nPerformers: Nicola Pianzola, Anuradha Venkataraman\nChoreography: Anuradha Venkataraman, Nicola\u00a0Pianzola\nPerformance in video, original songs and voice over: Anna\u00a0Dora Dorno, Nicola Pianzola, Anuradha Venkataraman\nOriginal music and sound design: Riccardo Nanni\nVideo creation: Anna Dora Dorno, Nicola Pianzola,\u00a0Ashwin Iyer\nSet and Light design: Anna Dora Dorno\nProduction: Istituto Italiano di cultura in Mumbai, Instabili Vaganti, Ahum Trust\nSupporters: MIC Ministry of culture / Istituto Italiano di cultura in New Delhi \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "In this interactive and participatory talk by\u00a0Alice Fox and Dr Hannah Macpherson, participants will be introduced to the\u00a0underpinning ideals and philosophies of Inclusive Art,\u00a0including the relational components to inclusive work, the philosophy of coming into being\u00a0and the crucial emphasis on collaboration and creative listening. \nThe session will then address critics of\u00a0such participatory practice and show how in art there is more than hope (or sweet dreams!),\u00a0there are proven benefits (for culture, health and life). \nThe speakers suggest avoiding leaning into overly narrow identity-based work and instead embracing our commonalities\u2014including all our diversity\u2014through Inclusive Arts. This requires nuance. Reflecting on some of the journeys they have taken with the practice of Inclusive Arts in Asia, they will show how collaborative practices, first developed alongside neurodiverse people and people with learning disabilities, have become relevant to collaborating with a wide range of people. \nThe talk will then seek to answer the following provocations using some practical participatory\u00a0activities: \n\nHow do we travel at the speed of trust using forms of Inclusive Arts practice?\nWhat\u2019s next for Inclusive Art? How might we \u2018come into being\u2019 inclusively with each\u00a0other, our art materials and the environment?\n\nThis talk will include experiential group activities suitable to all. Come prepared to participate. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "A little over five hundred years ago, in a green valley surrounded by tall mountains, a Timurid prince named Babur was born. Babur\u2019s tumultuous life led him to India, where he laid the foundations of what would become one of the wealthiest empires in the world. \nBabur\u2019s descendants would reshape the cuisine, music, art and landscape of their new home, creating a vibrant, syncretic culture of intellectual curiosity and an openness to new influences. Yet, from its zenith in the seventeenth century, the empire would decline swiftly, and end in tragedy three hundred years after it began. \nWho were the men and women who peopled this empire? How did their choices influence the course of history? From Humayun, the emperor who looked to the stars for guidance, to Jahangir, the ever-curious traveller, to the tragic figure of Shah Alam II, this session will focus on the triumphs and tragedies of the Timurids, and why their stories still matter. \nA talk by the author will be followed by a discussion with Meera Iyer, INTACH and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "75 mins | Persian, English | 2023 | India, Iran \nFascinated by Iran\u2019s film culture and the poetic works of the feminist poet Forough Farrokhzad, Indian filmmaker Sreemoyee Singh sets out in search of the protagonists of Iranian cinema. Her interactions over six years with filmmakers Jafar Panahi, Mohammad Shirvani and human rights activist Nasrin Sotudeh, among others, depict the precarious situation in which critics of the regime find themselves, including the constant threat of imprisonment and being banned from practicing their profession. With a keen eye for unusual situations, she poetically captures the effect of the Islamic Republic\u2019s omnipresent censorship on the daily lives of Iranian women whose uncompromising struggle has put them at the forefront of the protests that are currently rocking the country. \nAnd, Towards\u00a0Happy\u00a0Alleys\u00a0is a passionate declaration of love for the cinema and poetry of Iran which also provides a frank view of daily life, and bears witness to a fearless generation raising its voice and implacably demanding its civil liberties. \nInspired by Iranian cinema and the poetry of Forough Farrokhzad, a young director from India journeys to Tehran to witness how resistance becomes a daily act of survival in Iranian society. Despite stringent censorship of the Islamic Regime, she collects a series of eloquent and candid interviews with filmmaker Jafar Panahi, activists and Iranian women. Over six years, these conversations with the camera capture the simmering anxieties, fears, hopes and dreams of a nation on the brink of revolution. \nThe screening will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Imagine a world without hunger and malnutrition. What would it take to achieve a genuinely food-secure world\u2014where every person gets to consume the right quantity and quality of food to live a healthy, active, and productive life? \nAchieving and sustaining such a future requires transforming how our food is grown, managed, distributed, and consumed. From production to consumption, our food systems must be more sustainable, halting environmental degradation, and even repairing the damage we have previously done. \nGlenn Denning\u2019s Universal Food Security: How to End Hunger While Protecting the Planet presents a bold, evidence-based, practical guide to food systems transformation. He bridges the divisive worlds of science, policy, and practice. By synthesizing the most relevant literature, consulting the world\u2019s foremost experts, and sharing personal insights gained over four decades, Denning lays out five priority areas for action and investment. \nBut in Universal Food Security, Denning goes beyond what needs to change. He goes on to tackle the challenges of implementation. Echoing the words of his mentor, the late Professor MS Swaminathan, Denning argues that we need the knowhow and the do-how to transform our food systems.\u00a0 \nUniversal Food Security\u00a0calls for a new generation of enlightened practitioner-leaders\u2014acting on their own and with others, through institutions\u2014to achieve a food-secure world. \nImage Captions:\nThumbnail, Poster and Header: Rice crops in Cambodia\nInstastory: Maize crops in Malawi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "*This work contains scenes that explore mature themes. Viewer discretion is advised.* \nThe irreverent\u00a0That\u2019s All Folks!, premiered at the Equilibrio Festival 2024 and draws inspiration from cartoons. In a minimalist set, a quartet of international performers\u2014Damiano Ottavio Bigi, Ching-Ying Chien, Issue Park, and Faith Prendergast\u2014explore a work that blends dance, science, and myth. Inspired by the concept of the \u2018event horizon,\u2019 it delves into physical vertigo, the fall, and being drawn into a space where perspective shifts and everything changes depending on where we look. \nThis project continues the themes of Un Discreto Protagonista, expanding the conversation on choreographic writing and artistic composition. While the previous work focused on the universe\u2019s origins and astronomical processes, this piece shifts to humanity\u2019s relationship with the cosmos. \nWorking with a quartet of dancers, the team explored two distinct paths. The first centers on a \u201cpurely physical narrative,\u201d using complex movement patterns to create a thematic structure that unfolds gradually. This investigation draws on ritual forms connected to founding myths and cosmology, balancing irrationality with control and chaos with logic to explore interconnected spatial and dimensional relationships. \nThe second path constructs four characters suspended in an undefined space\u2014a non-time and non-place\u2014where they encounter their unconscious and archetypal memories. Inspired by the event horizon concept, the characters search for a new beginning, questioning whether our world could have emerged from a previous universe, in a moment called \u201cthe bounce,\u201d when space and time dissolved into a cloud of probabilities. \nThrough this journey, they question the nature of time, motion, and instability in a place where there is no fixed perspective. Our vulnerabilities and strengths are mixed as we teeter on the edge, learning more about ourselves. \nCreated by Damiano Ottavio Bigi & Alessandra Paoletti\nPerformers: Damiano Ottavio Bigi, Ching-Ying Chien, Issue Park, Faith Prendergast\nComposition and Sound Design: David Blouin\nMusic: David Blouin, Colin Stetson / Sarah Neufeld Duo, Gary \u2018Oslide, Henry Purcell, Hank Williams\nLighting Design: Lucien Laborderie\nSet and Costumes: In collaboration with Tzela Christopoulou\nSet Construction: Marios Karaolis \nPlease note: Kindly arrive and be seated by 7:15pm.

    "description": "Kattam Katti transports you to Uttarayan, the world-famous kite festival in Gujurat, North India, where millions of people from different cities, religions, and social classes come together to fly kites, marking the transition from winter into spring.  \nTapping into the competitive chaos, creativity, and colour of the event, the show brings to life the excitement of Uttarayan with lyricism, drama, and exquisite technique. It illustrates the highs and lows, loves and losses of the lives that are lived out among the festivities. Kite flying becomes a metaphor for the injustice of unevenly distributed privilege, in both the corporate world and society more generally.\u00a0 \nChoreography: Urja Desai Thakore\nSet Design: Simon Daw\nLighting Design: Hector Murray\nDramaturgy: Lou Cope\nCostume Design: Urja Desai Thakore, Simon Daw, and Abha Desai Original Creative Producer: Nina Head\nCreative Producer: Lia Prentaki\nProduction Manager: Salvatore Scollo\nStage Manager: Ben Gray\nSound Engineer: Camilo Tirado\nLighting Technician: Chris Burr\u00a0 \nSpecial thanks to Alap Desai, Chitra Sundaram, Michael Hulls, Parbati Chaudhry, Madhusoodanan Satchithannandan , Nina Head, and Eva Martinez\u00a0 \nCommissioned by Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre, London.

    "description": "Sevens is a triple bill of dance pieces, featuring Nina Rajarani as a performer, as well as\nfour Bharatanatyam and Kathak dancers and three musicians in ensemble work. Seven\nSnags, Seven Steps and Seven Sins explore the sacred and sinful significance of the\nnumber seven. \nSeven Snags \nThe choreographic equivalent of an obstacle race, this is a fast-paced rhythmic ensemble filled with exciting dynamics and laced with challenging cross-rhythms. This is an abstract display of the fun and frolics of youth, the flirtatious quality of interactions, the freedom and liberties one takes with choices, all inspired by the modern-day phenomena of speed dating and dating apps. \n\u00a0 \nSeven Steps \nThis is a duet by dancer/choreographer Nina Rajarani MBE and vocalist/composer Y Yadavan, based on \u2018saptapadi\u2019, the most important rite of a Hindu marriage ceremony, where with each step, the couple make a promise to each other.\u00a0 \nAlthough an age-old ritual dating back to Vedic times, the vows remain relevant for anyone entering a committed relationship.\u00a0 \nSeven Sins \nThis piece is an abstract exploration of stereotyped concept of rights and wrongs ,\u00a0what it is like to live under the burden of the idea of sin. The behaviour we call \u2018sinful\u2019 is never simply that. Sins are the most profound expression of unmet needs. Representing an unfortunate response to difficulty and distress, Seven Sins considers that we are not evil at all, but in fact in all types of very human and difficult pain. \nThe piece evolves to evoke both the claustrophobic feeling of guilt that comes from living a life deemed sinful, untrue or unacceptable; and the dark places we are driven towards by a capitalistic consumerist society that simultaneously demands and condemns accumulation and wealth. \nBut the journey of the piece is one of acceptance as we learn to listen, not admonish or punish, a way to forgiveness.\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n \n",
