    "description": "Born in Mali and raised in France, Aboubakar Fofana is a multidisciplinary artist and designer whose practice spans calligraphy, textiles, and natural dyes. Renowned for reinvigorating and redefining traditional West African indigo dyeing techniques, Fofana\u2019s work is rooted in a deep spiritual belief that nature is divine \u2014 that by honoring this divinity, we begin to comprehend the vast and sacred interconnectedness of the universe. \nIn this conversation, Fofana will reflect on indigo and others as material and metaphor \u2014 a living medium through which memory, ecology, and spirituality converge. His process engages with the natural cycles of growth and decay, birth and transformation, positioning indigo not simply as pigment but as an agent of renewal. For Fofana, the act of making becomes a form of meditation, where touch, rhythm, and the alchemy of fermentation reveal a profound dialogue between human intention and the natural world. \nThe talk will also offer insight into his current work in Siby, Mali, where he is creating a community-based farm that places indigenous West African indigo at the heart of a holistic permaculture system of local food, medicine, and dye plants. This ambitious project embodies his commitment to cultural preservation, environmental stewardship, and the rebirth of fermented indigo dyeing in contemporary practice. \nMaterial, Memory, and the Sacred invites audiences to experience indigo as a spiritual practice, a bridge between craft and cosmology, where colour, earth, and devotion become inseparable. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Works of art are good things to think about. They awaken our senses, invite interpretation, and spark curiosity. Join us in the library to discover how art can nurture observation, critical thinking, and inquiry. \nIn this session, we\u2019ll dive into the world of Warli painting, an ancient tribal art tradition of Maharashtra. Its distinctive pictogram style is rich in detail yet easy to decode and connect with. \nChildren will look closely at a Warli painting, form thoughtful interpretations, and wonder about the stories it holds. They\u2019ll also have an opportunity to tell their own stories using Warli motifs. \nCome, see, think, and wonder with us! \nAround the World in 50 Sundays\u00a0is a journey that begins, not with a ticket, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "When movement whispers and stillness breathes, something enduring is set in motion. \nOn our next evening of Dual Margam, two distinct classical traditions return in dialogue \u2013 the lyrical subtlety of Manipuri from Manipur and the architectural elegance of Odissi from Odisha. \nManipuri, in its feminine form, is marked by circular motion, understated footwork, and an inward quietude that evokes devotion and tenderness. Odissi, by contrast, is shaped through defined stances and sculpted transitions, where each turn of the body becomes an offering of story and song. \nThis performance brings together two women dancers in the Odissi\u2013Manipuri conversation, setting two vocabularies side by side: one fluid and veiled, the other precise and chiselled. \nThe second in a two-part Odissi\u2013Manipuri dialogue, this evening unfolds through the feminine body, following last month\u2019s exploration by two male dancers. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n",

Sung during auspicious occasions such as marriage, childbirth, and festivals, these songs celebrate womanhood in all its beauty and grace, blending melody, poetry, and emotion into a timeless cultural expression. \nIn this edition of\u00a0BIC Janapada, audiences will experience\u00a0Shobane P\u0101\u1e0da\u00a0through two distinct regional lenses, from the soulful verses of\u00a0Pattalamma Janapada Kala Sangha, led by Krishne Gowda from Mandya in Southern Karnataka, to the earthy, resonant tunes of\u00a0GK Kala Vedika\u00a0from North Karnataka. Together, they offer a rare glimpse into how different communities express shared emotions through diverse musical idioms and dialects. \nThrough live renditions and storytelling, the session explores the social and cultural significance of\u00a0Shobane, how these songs serve as a collective blessing, a space for women to voice joy, longing, and devotion. The audience will be invited to experience the changing rhythms and tones that mark life\u2019s transitions, from the playful to the profound. \nMore than just performance, this is a celebration of continuity ,of how music has always been a vessel for community, emotion, and identity in Karnataka\u2019s living traditions. \nThis is the fifth performance of our series\u00a0BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka\u2019s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression.\u00a0Through demonstrations, performances, and academic discussions, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Over the past two decades, Bengaluru\u2019s exploding real estate sector and massive infrastructure investments have led to land speculation targeting working-class neighborhoods and agricultural land for development.\u00a0Chronicles of a Global\u00a0City\u00a0turns Bengaluru inside out to examine its \u201cworld-city\u201d transformation that stimulated rapid urbanization and unbounded growth. Moving the spotlight away from the urban elites and the new middle class, the essays in the volume explore how people caught up in the whirlwinds of change in Bengaluru\u2014from construction laborers, street vendors, domestic workers, and platform delivery workers to small-time property brokers, petty landlords, and local politicians\u2014experience, struggle, aspire, invent, strive and speculate to make a livable\u00a0city\u00a0for themselves. \nGrounded in long-term ethnographic research, the volume introduces the idea of \u201cspeculative urbanism\u201d to reveal the complex entanglements of finance, real estate, livelihoods, and ecology in Bengaluru\u2019s unfolding futures. \nThe discussion features contributors to the volume and two discussants, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "Who gets to eat what, how, and with whom? \nIn South Asia, purity and pollution have structured food taboos across caste and religion, while colonial impositions of Victorian table manners reshaped ideas of civility and hygiene. \nThis session explores caste-based dining exclusions, Ambedkar\u2019s critique in Beef, Brahmins, and Broken Men, Islamic logics of fasting and pork prohibition, and the gendered burdens of cooking. We also connect to global veganism, examining its promises and blind spots in a South Asian context. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",
