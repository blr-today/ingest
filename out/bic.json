Weaver, mystic, poet, Shah Hussain kept away from \u2018peeri\u2019, \u2018meeri\u2019, all kinds of high sounding titles, he lives in our hearts as \u2018faqeer nimaana\u2019 (the lowly faqeer). \nMela Chiraaga\u2019an Urs is celebrated every year in remembrance of this poet faqeer Shah Hussain and his beloved disciple, a Hindu Brahmin boy Madho Lal, as they lie buried in their twin graves near Lahore. So inextricably connected, Shah Husain is also remembered as Madho Lal Hussain. 2024 marks Madho lal Hussain\u2019s 436th Urs, his death anniversary, a celebration of the final union with the beloved divine ( \u2018Urus\u2019 in Arabic is a wedding) \nThis Mela, a confluence of his poetry, woven with music and narrative, is his journey as a Julaaha (weaver), a \u2018malaamati\u2019, as Faqeer Nimaana, the lowly faqeer. It celebrates Punjab\u2019s common cultural landscape, the common poetry, the language, the voice, which remains one despite the border that separates us. \n",

    "description": "90 Minutes | Hindi (Tukaram abhangs will be sung in Marathi) | Ages 16 years + \nThis play is an adaptation of the seminal Marathi novel \u2018Anandowari\u2019 written by D.B. Mokashi in 1974. \nAnandowari (English translation: \u2018The Verandah of Bliss\u2019) looks at 17th-century saint poet Tukaram\u2019s story through his younger brother Kanha\u2019s perspective. Tukaram has gone missing again. This time, though, the hints seem ominous. We travel through those 3 days of Kanha\u2019s frantic search for Tuka and his many realisations about his brother. \nIn reminiscing about Tukaram, Kanha tries to grapple with Tuka\u2019s many identities: Tuka his brother, the son, the householder, the creative genius, a saint, a reformer, a rebel. \nThis act of reminiscence becomes an act of grappling with what and who he has lost, in the process giving us a great psychological insight into the events (personal, social and political) and impulses that shaped Tukaram\u2019s consciousness and made him who he was: one of the most beloved Bhakti saint poets of Maharashtra, as tender as he was fierce, as compassionate as he was unforgivingly harsh, as much a reformist as he was a transcendentalist. \nOur adaptation focuses on the search that lies at the heart of the text: a devotee in search of God, a man in search of his brother, a writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nCredits: \nOriginal Novel Anandowari by D.B Mokashi\nAdaptation and Direction: Gerish Khemani\nHindi Translation: Dr Jaya Dayal\nPerformed by: Varad Salvekar, Hrishabh Kanti\nBackground Score: Ruturaj Bhosle\nAbhang Composition: Keshav Kudale\nLight Design: Sachin Lele\nLights Operation: Prerana\nPoster and Creatives: Robin Patel \nDirector\u2019s Note: \nWhat interested me personally was the question of the creative consciousness of the saint poet Tukaram, the source of his poetry, his metaphysical preoccupations, his social rebellion, his love for his beloved God Vitthal. I was interested in finding a device through which I could approach this text. And then it struck me: what would happen if the writer stepped into his own story? His character has found salvation, what about the writer? How will he? It is an investigation into that search\u2026 A devotee in search of God. A man in search of his brother. A writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nThrough two texts \u2013 D. B Mokashi\u2019s original Anandowari and my text where Tuka meets Vithal and Mokashi enters his own story \u2013 multiple confrontations are imagined. Confrontation between Mokashi (writer) and Kanha (character), confrontation between Tuka (devotee) and Vitthal (God). Creator and creation? One writer (Mokashi) searching for another (Tuka)? And then the question prevails: Who gives meaning to the other? Both depend on each other for meaning. For identity. Can there be a God without a devotee? Can there be a writer without her creation? Each validates the other. And each has the power to cancel each other out. \nBut then what if they exchange roles? Or what if this duality itself is the biggest illusion? And so these two texts came to be juxtaposed, hoping to interpenetrate and illuminate each other. \nOur adaptation of Anandowari reeks of tremendous longing for the absolute and the madness, pain of creative consciousness and its concomitant search for meaning embodied in the existential desperation of the protagonists. \nWith Support From \n \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "Puuluup, consisting of Ramo Teder (also known as Pastacas) and Marko Veisson, has captivated audiences worldwide with their innovative blend of traditional and modern music. Since their inception in 2014, they have performed across Estonia and in numerous countries, including Belgium, China, India, and the United States. Their music, a unique fusion of the Hiiu kannel (a two to four stringed bowed lyre from northern Europe) with electronic elements, has garnered significant acclaim, and they recently represented Estonia at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2024 and will be bringing their music to the acclaimed Jodhpur RIFF festival later this year. \nCrossing Hiiu kannel with electronics, Puuluup oscillates on the border of tradition and modern music styles, flirting with world music, underground and pop. Puuluup controls the vibrations of hiiu kannel\u2019s strings through effect blocks and the looper and uses alternative playing techniques and sound generation options. Electronically amplified echoes, knocks, squeaks and scrapes are added to the soft hiss of Hiiu kannel. The music is at times dance-pulsating and at times cinematic and dark, creeping in and carried over from the chambers of the ancient Vormsi talharpists. It sounds like original creations impregnated with tradition, references to punk classics and romantic neo-zombie post-folk with educational content. \nIn collaboration with:\n \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "Professor Satish Chandra was one of the first historians to shift our attention from the emperors of the Mughal Empire to its people. \nDrawing upon his works, this lecture highlights the contribution of common people in the formation of the empire. It does this by focusing on two groups that played important roles in the domain of warfare. Firstly, it investigates the vast numbers of mercenaries and armed peasants who served as foot-soldiers in the armies. They served as guards, swordsmen, gunners, and archers. Secondly, it studies the pioneers, carpenters, stone-cutters, boatmen, and other workers who toiled in the domain of military logistics. They built roads, constructed bridges, dug tunnels, and looked after the war-animals in the course of campaigns. It argues that the participation of vast numbers of common people in these two capacities was key to the functioning of the empire. This implies that the empire was not an elite project created only by emperors, noblemen, and courtiers. Rather, it was a broad-based political entity that rested on the work and involvement of vast sections of the South Asian population. \nAbout Prof. Satish Chandra \nProf. Satish Chandra (1922 \u2013 2017) was a leading authority on Medieval Indian History. \nIn a career spanning nearly 40 years, Prof. Chandra taught history at Allahabad University, Aligarh Muslim University, Delhi University, Rajasthan University, and finally the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where along with S. Gopal, Bipin Chandra and Romila Thapar he co-founded the Centre for Historical Studies. \nIn between, from 1972 to 1980 he was first Vice Chairman and then the Chairman of the University Grants Commission. \nIn 1985, along with intellectuals like Prof. Nurul Hasan and marine biologist Dr. Zahoor Qasim, he founded the Society for Indian Ocean Studies which, among other activities, brings out the quarterly Journal for Indian Ocean Studies. \nSon of Sir Sita Ram, India\u2019s first High Commissioner to Pakistan (1947-48), Prof. Chandra has, along with some other JNU historians, been said to have been a \u2018left leaning historian\u2019 who espoused the Marxist approach to history, and one whose early experiences helped bridge the intellectual gap in interpreting medieval Indian history and modern times. \n",

    "description": "In 2018, Rahul Bhatia left his job as an investigative reporter to understand the necessity of the Aadhaar project. But over time, as he explored its roots, questions about citizenship and belonging began to grow louder in public life, culminating in extreme violence in New Delhi. As this happened, he discovered that India\u2019s technological identity project was linked to a cultural identity project over a century old. These investigations culminated in The Identity Project, a journey through the slow burn of Indian democracy, and a record that connects the past and present to offer the first thorough account of how cultural imperatives are guiding the country\u2019s direction. He describes the religious, societal, and technological changes that have brought India to a point at which a nationalist mindset that challenges democracy and human rights is spreading fast, all in an effort to bind the multiethnic, multilingual, and multicultural country into a single identity. \nThrough a character-driven narrative informed by on the ground reporting, he investigates the history of disinformation in India, and looks at how justice works in the aftermath of riots. What emerges is a timely portrait of a country struggling to define its identity. \nEditor and journalist Prem Panicker will discuss the book with Rahul Bhatia. They will talk about the book\u2019s journey, the process of reporting, and about finding the language to report on recent history.\u00a0A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n",
