    "description": "When we pick a fruit in the bazaar or slice one open at home, we rarely pause to think about it beyond its taste. Yet inside that familiar fruit lies an extraordinary story that was shaped by millions of years of evolution, intricate ecological partnerships, centuries of human history, and layers of culture, belief, and science. \nThe story of fruits and fruiting trees begins deep in evolutionary time. Fleshy fruits evolved as ingenious biological strategies, forming partnerships with animals such as birds, bats, insects, fish, and primates. By offering sweetness, colour, and aroma, fruiting plants persuaded animals to pollinate flowers and disperse seeds, allowing forests to regenerate and spread. Many fruits still carry the signatures of these ancient relationships, including partnerships with species that no longer exist. Even today, wild and domesticated fruit trees play a vital ecological role, sustaining wildlife and supporting human communities. \nIts not just forests, fruits even entered our myths, rituals, art, and language as powerful symbols of love, abundance, devotion, and prosperity. Mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, figs, and jamun trees appear in epics, festivals, temple carvings, poetry, songs, and everyday expressions. These cultural traces reveal that fruits did far more than nourish bodies. They shaped values, metaphors, memories, and ways of understanding the natural world. Fruits also travelled with people, quietly reshaping landscapes and diets. India is rich in the diversity of edible fruits and they are deeply connected to global exchange. Rulers and states invested in orchards and experimentation, treating horticulture as a serious pursuit tied to prestige, power, and knowledge. Fruit trees became markers of place, preserving geography and history in their names even as political borders shifted. During the last few centuries, botanical gardens, experimental farms, and public parks became testing grounds where fruit trees from across the world were introduced, studied, and distributed. These spaces reshaped what farmers grew and what people ate, linking plants to systems of governance, science, and economy. \nPerennial fruit trees offer hope in a warming world. They support biodiversity, store carbon, stabilise soils, and build ecological and social resilience. By weaving together evolution, ecology, culture, history, and climate, this talk attempts to show that fruit trees are not just sources of sweetness. The talk attempts to invite everyone to see the humble fruit tree not just as food, but as a living thread that binds India\u2019s landscapes, livelihoods, and legends. \n\u00a0 \nWith this programme, the Bangalore International Centre remembers the contributions of our member Vijay Thiruvady in three landmark lectures that he gave at the BIC, on the \u201cGreening of Bangalore\u201d with Girish Karnad and Capt. Prabhala (2015), on \u201cBotanical Illustrations\u201d with Nirupa Rao (2019), and on \u201cWhy Lalbagh Matters\u201d (2021). \nAmong the accounts of our city, Vijay Thiruvady\u2019s book,\u00a0Lalbagh \u2013 Sultans\u2019 Garden to Public Park,\u00a0published by the Bangalore Environment Trust, presents the most comprehensive history of Lalbagh written to date. Ranging across five centuries, it presents a panoramic view from Kempegowda\u2019s flower garden in 1537, through Haider and Tipu (1760 to 1799), to the East India Company years \u2014 Scottish army men and surgeons \u2014 and over a century by six Kew trained gardeners. The book is based on research from several archives, including Kew Gardens and the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, and of course on Vijay Thiruvady\u2019s intimate knowledge of Lalbagh having conducted inspiring nature walks for over 18 years that were attended by over 15,000 walkers. \nVijay Thiruvady was always interested in various aspects of nature and more specifically horticulture. In addition to the Green Heritage Walks in Lalbagh, he conducted Imperial Colonial Walks in Cubbon Park and Military Heritage Walks at the MEG&C, and participated in the various activities of Bangalore Environment Trust as a Trustee. These have included the publishing of notable books on Heritage Trees in and around Bangalore and on Devarakadus and Gundutopus in the vicinity of Bangalore. \nThiruvady spent his early years in Delhi.\u00a0 His academic interests were pursued at\nSt. Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi and School of Architecture, Ahmedabad.\u00a0 When in Delhi, he had exposure to the world of nature and environment through association with a number of distinguished people in the field and institutions. \nHe gave talks on Bangalore, its environment and history at many institutions, including the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Raman Research Institute, BIC, Bangalore Club, National Gallery of Modern Art, and Azim Premji University. A gifted raconteur, his encyclopedic knowledge of trees and of Bangalore\u2019s history were conveyed through stories that kindled a love of nature and made his walks, lectures and books memorable, connecting with young and old from around the world, from experts in the field to school children.\u00a0His passing in August 2023 is a profound loss to the city. \nVijay Thiruvady\u2019s talk on Lalbagh at the BIC, which has been widely viewed as an introduction to the botanical garden and to Bangalore and its history, is available\u00a0here. \nHis short essays on trees are available\u00a0here. \nAn article about him in Frontline magazine is available\u00a0here. \n\u00a0 \nTea will be served at 5 pm. \n",

In either case, it becomes a story to tell over coffee. \nBut who are the people on the other end of line? \nIn her new book, Scamlands, journalist\u00a0Snidha Poonam explores\u00a0the vast fraud economies stretching from small-town India to global scam hubs.\u00a0Nuanced, detailed and above all, personal, Poonam reports on the many lives that run parallel to our own.\u00a0Tracing the supply chains of fraud, she reveals an economy that\u2019s both ruthlessly efficient and heartbreakingly human. \nIn this talk, she is joined by columnist Aakar Patel to explore the themes of the book. They will examine how scam economies thrive in the gaps of inequality, why trust is collapsing faster than we can rebuild it, and what it means when fraud becomes a viable career path for an entire generation. The session ends with an audience Q&A. \nThere are no easy answers, but you\u2019ll know more when that unknown number calls again. \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "How do we teach children to hold difference without fracturing? \nAs worldviews polarize globally, education becomes critical terrain for cultivating resilience, communicating values, and building social connectedness among the youth of today. Professor Arniika Kuusisto, leading scholar of early childhood education at the University of Helsinki, presents empirical findings from Finland exploring this urgent challenge. \nThis talk examines educational approaches that equip children to navigate difference constructively. Rather than erasure, Kuusisto focuses on developing capacities for genuine engagement across divides. In increasingly pluralistic societies, the question extends beyond tolerance: how do we foster peer communities where diversity becomes source of strength rather than fragmentation? \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University\u2019s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "We have forgotten how to be citizens of our cities. \nWalk through any Indian metropolis and witness a peculiar contradiction: millions inhabit these spaces, yet relate to them only as consumers demanding services. Grievances fragment predictably: the affluent lobby for metro lines while informal settlements fight for sanitation. Each sees the city as a provider that has failed them specifically. \nThis transactional relationship reveals something deeper. Unlike villages steeped in cultural memory or monuments heavy with civilizational pride, the contemporary Indian city exists in our imagination as politically neutral backdrop; a space for commerce and commute, stripped of meaning beyond utility. Without empowered local governance in our collective memory, we cannot envision what urban citizenship might demand. \nThis talk outlines a strategy for civic activism that reimagines the city as living system, shaping who we become through daily encounters. It argues we must ask radical questions. Not merely what services we need, but what kind of city allows dignity, creativity, joy. What connections between citizens create genuine community? What relationship between citizen and state honors our full humanity? \nThe struggle for better governance is simultaneously a struggle to define what kind of people we wish to be\u2014together. \n",

    "description": "James Payne never set out to become a YouTube sensation. He simply wanted to make art history accessible, stumbling into fame with over a million subscribers along the way. But perhaps that\u2019s precisely the point. \n\u201cIn a world of noise and distraction,\u201d Payne says, \u201cgreat art slows us down. It demands attention, reflection, and interpretation. It doesn\u2019t exist to give us easy answers\u2014but it does give us better questions.\u201d \nIn this illustrated talk, Payne brings his signature storytelling and striking visuals to explore celebrated artworks not as distant masterpieces, but as creations shaped by real people, real pressures, real ambitions. Through visual analysis, historical context, and human stories, he reveals how art intersects with power, class, money, religion, politics, and everyday life. No academic jargon. No dense theory. Just essential questions: Why was this made? What did it mean then? Why does it matter now? \nThroughout the talk, Payne encourages and guides the audience to slow down and really look. Details often missed in galleries are brought into focus, helping viewers understand how artists guide the eye, create meaning, and communicate emotion. As much as it is about learning facts, the talk is about learning how to look. \nThis is art history as it should be: open, democratic, relevant. Payne will be signing copies of his book after the session. \n",

    "description": "This recital presents J.S. Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations, BWV 988, performed by pianist Eun Seong Hong. The programme invites the audience into an evening of focused listening and reflection, exploring how a single musical idea can unfold into a rich and expansive journey. Presented in India by Eun Seong Hong for the first time, this performance offers a space where structure, balance, and contemplation resonate naturally across cultures. \nThe Goldberg Variations form a small universe built with astonishing perfection: thirty variations framed by an opening and closing aria, all sustained by a single, unchanging bass line. Across its thirty-two movements, the work unfolds like a hidden architecture in time\u2014at once rigorous and deeply expressive. For the performer, this music is not only a technical or structural challenge, but an inward journey, where each note embodies order, reflection, and a sense of profound balance. \n\u00a0 \nImage Credit \nThumbnail and Poster: Johann Sebastian Bach (aged 61) in a portrait by Elias Gottlob Haussmann (1695-1774), the second version of his 1746 canvas, bequeathed to Bach-Archiv Leipzig by William H Scheide (Princeton, New Jersey).

    "description": "In Tell Me A Story About Our World, academic and translator Vanamala Viswanatha speaks to novelist Kavery Nambisan about the art of fiction and how she combines story-telling with a portrayal of the world in which the story is set. \nKavery\u2018s recent novel Rising Sons is as much about the Word as it is about the World. In telling the story of a single family from a small village in Karnataka, it implements language in its multilingual capacity, thus enabling the reader\u2019s sensibility to percolate society at different levels. Thus, Kannada coexists comfortably within the English novel and enriches the reading experience, not with novelty but realism. The story begins in pre-independent India and while staying true to the arc of a family\u2019s fortunes, it grapples with the complexities of caste and colonialism. It paints the landscape of rural and urban life of a bygone era, ending in the 1970s. \nThe session will conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "42 minutes |\u00a0\u00a0English & Hindi with English subtitles | India |\u00a02025 \nCompassion. Conflict. Culling. Care. \nMenace\u00a0is a documentary that examines one of the most contested questions in contemporary Indian cities: how do we coexist with stray dogs? Set against recent judicial directions and everyday urban realities, the film moves beyond polarised debates to explore the moral, legal, and governance dimensions of the issue. Through voices from animal welfare practitioners, veterinarians, lawyers, municipal actors, adopters, and citizens, Menace\u00a0traces the shift from historical practices of dog culling to the Animal Birth Control (ABC) framework, while questioning why humane policies often fail in implementation. \nThe screening will be followed by a moderated conversation bringing together perspectives from law, animal welfare, and civic practice. This programme invites audiences to engage with complexity, contradiction, and ethical choice: opening space for reflection on how cities negotiate care and safety without resorting to cruelty or neglect. \nThe screening will be followed by an interaction with the filmmaker. \n",

    "description": "What if a simple strip of green could catalyse profound transformation? \nOur cities bear the scars of a fractured relationship with the natural world: ecosystems dismantled for private gain, communities pushed to the periphery, public space increasingly territorialised. We find ourselves inhabiting environments which, by design, deny the fundamental truth that human life remains inextricably woven into the larger fabric of nature. However, there exists a compelling pathway toward restoration, one that challenges the very hierarchies defining contemporary urbanism. \nThis talk explores linear parks as a democratic intervention in citymaking: longitudinal green corridors that transcend boundaries of caste, class, religion and geography, weaving through urban fabric to create equitable, accessible commons. Drawing upon a groundbreaking movement in Mumbai, PK Das and Harini Nagendra will examine both the promise and complexities of implementation\u2014the successes, the shortcomings, and the lessons learned\u2014inviting us to reimagine how strategic greening can advance social justice, spatial equity, and environmental regeneration simultaneously. \nThis evening promises a conversation that sparks new possibilities for building cities which honour our interdependence with each other and with the natural world. \nThis session is part of the\u00a0Let\u2019s Talk Climate Change\u00a0Talk series. \nPresented by:\n \n",
