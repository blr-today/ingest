    "description": "Midlife is a phase when we find ourselves pulled in multiple directions\u2014across work, home, health, friendships, and hobbies. \nIn this session, Ravi Venkatesan delves into themes from Deepak Jayaraman\u2019s recent book, Play to Potential. The book offers a nuanced exploration of how to unlock human potential\u2014not just professionally but holistically\u2014by embracing life\u2019s highs and lows. Drawing from his acclaimed Play to Potential podcast and his experiences as a coach, Deepak introduces the FLAVOUR framework, a practical guide to navigating the intricate interplay of family, aspirations, values, and relationships. \nDeepak emphasises that life is a team sport, with family serving as an essential support system. He argues that personal growth and achievement are deeply intertwined with our family contexts, a perspective often overlooked in self-help literature, particularly in cultures where family plays a central role. \nA key insight of the book is the recognition that life unfolds in seasons, shaped by transitions\u2014some intentional, others unexpected. Using real-life examples and case studies, Deepak illustrates how navigating these transitions thoughtfully is vital to realising our potential. \nThis discussion will resonate with anyone in their 30s to 60s, offering valuable strategies to lead a multi-dimensional, purposeful life. \n",

    "description": "Being immune to the charms of poetry is a crime that is its own punishment, the Sanskritic tradition tells us. Join us as we discover the allure of Sanskrit and Prakrit love poetry and the travails of translating doe-eyes and elephant-thighs into English with Anusha Rao and Suhas Mahesh, co-translators of the verse anthology, How to Love in Sanskrit (HarperCollins 2024). \nHow to Love in Sanskrit is a poetic exploration of the maze of modern dating: flirting, daydreaming, yearning, and breaking up, through the eyes of Kalidasa, Bana, Vidya, and many other, often anonymous gifted poets. \nModerated by Radhika Chadha, the translators will discuss their inspiration for the book, their approach to translation, misconceptions about Sanskrit poetry, and the challenges of translating pre-modern poetry, drawing from both classic and forgotten texts to paint a picture of what love feels like in Sanskrit. The session will conclude with a reading of their favourite verses from the book. \n",

    "description": "The lecture will explore efforts to engage the public in conserving India\u2019s extraordinary plant diversity. This diversity forms the foundation of our diverse ecosystems, nourishes us, sustains our health, mitigates climate change, and offers spiritual, recreational, and other invaluable benefits. Vijay Thiruvady utilized botanical gardens like Lalbagh to showcase India\u2019s plant wealth and inspire the public to contribute to safeguarding our natural heritage. Professor Bawa will highlight\u00a0 ATREE\u2019s recent, innovative initiatives aimed at connecting scientists, students, and the general public to the world of plants. These efforts could promote deeper interactions with nature and continue Vijay Thiruvady\u2019s enduring legacy. \n \nWith this programme, the Bangalore International Centre remembers the contributions of our member Vijay Thiruvady in three landmark lectures that he gave at the BIC, on the \u201cGreening of Bangalore\u201d with Girish Karnad and Capt. Prabhala (2015), on \u201cBotanical Illustrations\u201d with Nirupa Rao (2019), and on \u201cWhy Lalbagh Matters\u201d (2021). \nVijay Thiruvady was always interested in various aspects of nature and more specifically horticulture. Among the accounts of our city, his book Lalbagh \u2013 Sultans\u2019 Garden to Public Park presents the most comprehensive history of Lalbagh written to date. Ranging across five centuries, it draws on various archives and on his own intimate knowledge of Lalbagh having conducted inspiring nature walks for over 18 years that were attended by over 15,000 walkers. In addition to the Green Heritage Walks in Lalbagh, he conducted Imperial Colonial Walks in Cubbon Park and Military Heritage Walks at the MEG&C, and participated in the various activities of Bangalore Environment Trust as a Trustee. These have included the publishing of notable books on Heritage Trees in and around Bangalore and on Devarakadus and Gundutopus in the vicinity of Bangalore. \nThiruvady spent his early years in Delhi. His academic interests were pursued at St. Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi and School of Architecture, Ahmedabad. When in Delhi, he had exposure to the world of nature and environment through association with a number of distinguished people in the field and institutions. \nIn his later years, he gave talks on Bangalore, its environment and history at many institutions. A gifted raconteur, his encyclopedic knowledge of trees and of Bangalore\u2019s history were conveyed through stories that kindled a love of nature and made his walks, lectures and books memorable, connecting with young and old from around the world, from experts in the field to school children.\u00a0His passing in August 2023 was a profound loss to the city. \nVijay Thiruvady\u2019s talk on Lalbagh at the BIC, which has been widely viewed as an introduction to the botanical garden and to Bangalore and its history, is available here. \nHis short essays on trees are available here. \nAn article about him in Frontline magazine is available here. \nImage Captions \nThumbnail and Poster: Impatiens species from the Himalaya \nHeader and Instastory: Rhododendron arboreum in the Himalaya\u00a0 \nJoseph Hooker, the British botanist, on his plant collecting expedition in the Himalaya (1847-1851) gathered over twenty-five species of Rhododendron and wrote The Rhododendrons of Sikkim-Himalaya. He was also fascinated by the diversity of Impatiens (balsams or poor man\u2019s orchids) there and wrote to Charles Darwin about this incredible diversity. More than 100 species have been added from India since Hooker\u2019s account of Impatiens, and many remain to be discovered. \n\u00a0 \nTea will be served at 11 am. \n",

The research offers insights into patronage, methodologies, emergent technologies, and construction techniques and also sheds light on how the humane and social aspects of architecture characterized by participatory frameworks are being approached by practitioners today. It attempts to highlight modes of engagement as well as transgressions and synergies between disparate cultures, ways of representation, and knowledge accumulation and production. The first edition of the exhibition was shown at the India International Centre, New Delhi in December 2023, followed by the first travel edition at the Alliance Francaise, Chennai in August 2024. \nThe exhibition is part of the research project \u2013 State of Architecture in South Asia, which aims to collectively ask, across South Asia, the question: Does Architecture matter in a state of transition? In the region, numerous transitions, and uncertainties, encompassing climate change, political transformations, and socio-economic shifts, manifest in a heightened form within the daily existence of its populace. \u00a0A project initiated by the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University \u00a0and the Architecture Foundation, \u00a0visit https://www.soasouthasia.com for more details on the project. \nThe Travelling exhibition is produced by Prakriti Foundation and the Architecture Foundation \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "75 mins | Persian, English | 2023 | India, Iran \nFascinated by Iran\u2019s film culture and the poetic works of the feminist poet Forough Farrokhzad, Indian filmmaker Sreemoyee Singh sets out in search of the protagonists of Iranian cinema. Her interactions over six years with filmmakers Jafar Panahi, Mohammad Shirvani and human rights activist Nasrin Sotudeh, among others, depict the precarious situation in which critics of the regime find themselves, including the constant threat of imprisonment and being banned from practicing their profession. With a keen eye for unusual situations, she poetically captures the effect of the Islamic Republic\u2019s omnipresent censorship on the daily lives of Iranian women whose uncompromising struggle has put them at the forefront of the protests that are currently rocking the country. \nAnd, Towards\u00a0Happy\u00a0Alleys\u00a0is a passionate declaration of love for the cinema and poetry of Iran which also provides a frank view of daily life, and bears witness to a fearless generation raising its voice and implacably demanding its civil liberties. \nInspired by Iranian cinema and the poetry of Forough Farrokhzad, a young director from India journeys to Tehran to witness how resistance becomes a daily act of survival in Iranian society. Despite stringent censorship of the Islamic Regime, she collects a series of eloquent and candid interviews with filmmaker Jafar Panahi, activists and Iranian women. Over six years, these conversations with the camera capture the simmering anxieties, fears, hopes and dreams of a nation on the brink of revolution. \nThe screening will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "For complex projects in the public realm or at the scale of the city, actors become clearly differentiated, and hence the building of constituencies becomes crucial to engage different stakeholders in any project. This is often done through various media to put across ideas, and it is here that research and writing to communicate ideas of the city become an important part of the practice.  \nIn retrospect, publications become a way of creating partnerships, collaborations, and friendships which serve to keep alive the conversations on the issues at hand and engagement with the work we do. Similarly, these publications then go out into the world beyond the project and have a life of their own. But, most critically, in hindsight they allowed us to expand our \u2018sphere of influence\u2019 and equipped us to speculate about the future, simultaneously creating an archive of the present.  \nThe acts of archiving and reflecting, as well as simultaneously speculating and being propositional, are critical for us to gain agency as a profession. For, by committing to writing, drawing our speculations, or even discerning the patterns that surround us gives us agency as professionals in society. If we do not have agency or find ways to establish an agency, we will break down as a profession.  \nThis lecture will cover 30 years of Rahul Mehrotra\u2019s research and writings in the context of his engagement as a practitioner as well as advocate for various issues concerning Architecture and Urbanism in India. \nIn collaboration with: \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "2023 | 80 mins | English with subtitles \nLink to the trailer. \nOver half a century ago, India embarked on a pioneering journey to safeguard its tigers. Since then, the world has lost two-thirds of its wildlife, and India\u2019s human population has surged to 1.4 billion. Yet, India\u2019s tiger population has more than doubled, and the country is now home to approximately 70% of the world\u2019s last wild tigers. \nHowever, the path to this extraordinary achievement has been far from straightforward. This film takes you into the backstage of India\u2019s biggest and most ambitious wildlife conservation journey, narrating some untold stories that formed their legacy. But this is more than just a story of conservation. It\u2019s a tale of hope, resilience, and the bond between nature and the Indians. \nThe film showcases how the project has evolved over five decades, highlighting not only the triumphs but also the setbacks, controversies, and compromises made along the way. With an in-depth look at the complexities of tiger conservation, right from political challenges to poaching pressures, you will gain a deeper understanding of the immense efforts required to protect this iconic species. The film also sheds light on the steps needed to ensure that tigers continue to roam freely in India\u2019s forests for generations to come. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A session with the film\u2019s producer, Kalyan Varma. \n",

    "description": "The Constitution came into force on 26 January 1950. This session of The Forum asks, has the Constitution succeeded (so far)? \nEminent Senior Advocate Arvind Datar would say yes. In a recent talk celebrating the \u201cIndian Constitution @ 75 Years\u201d, he reminded us that most fledgling post-colonial states saw their experiments with democracy fail. By contrast, India\u2019s \u201cimprobable democracy\u201d survived the 20th Century, even in the face of existential threats. \nThen, how are we to make sense of India\u2019s current backsliding on global democracy rankings? How are we to respond to those who tell us that our fundamental rights and democratic institutions are in decline? We might worry that the Constitution is no longer fit for purpose. Yet, equally, we might see the Constitution as the only thing standing between us and tyranny. In short,\u00a0is the Constitution failing us? Or, are we failing the Constitution? \nIn this session, we will engage with these questions both by examining contemporary constitutional controversies and attempting to place them in the historical context of India\u2019s founding. \nNo prior knowledge of constitutional law is required.  \nThis is the third of our sessions titled,\u00a0The Forum,\u00a0a series of engaging discussions held at the BIC Library. Our goal is to bring together individuals from all walks of life,\u00a0ages 15 to 50, to discuss topics of importance in a setting that is both informed and informal. Whether you\u2019re passionate about current events, social issues, or cultural topics,\u00a0The Forum\u00a0provides a platform for open dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas.\u00a0Inspired by the ancient Roman forums, where citizens gathered to discuss and debate the issues of the day, these sessions aim to revive this tradition of community dialogue. \n",

    "description": "This lecture by Madhavan K. Palat, Secretary of the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund and editor of the forthcoming comprehensive online edition of the Nehru Archives, explores the complex and often paradoxical dimensions of Nehru\u2019s engagement with democracy. \nNehru presented himself as a liberal and a socialist. Yet, while he did not explicitly identify as a conservative, he frequently employed Burkean and traditionalist arguments to legitimize Indian democracy. At the same time, he repeatedly warned that democracy risked self-destruction through the emergence of a democratic dictatorship or the tyranny of the majority. \nPalat examines how Nehru derived the ethos of democracy from traditional panchayats and 19th-century nationalist movements, asserting that democracy had become the yugadharma\u2014the defining moral order\u2014after Independence. Nehru insisted that democracy had to be dynamic, propelled by movements but grounded in stable institutions. When conflicts inevitably arose between these two forces, he consistently prioritized movement, seeing it as a continuation of nationalist mobilization, while institutions embodied the legacy of the Constituent Assembly and its Constitution. \nYet, Nehru never saw the Constitution as a sacred text. Democracy, he believed, could only be safeguarded through democratic practice, not constitutional rigidity\u2014a stance that effectively repudiated the idea of a \u201cBasic Structure\u201d doctrine. Seeking to deepen democracy, Nehru championed Panchayati Raj, arguing that democracy required a broad, pyramid-like foundation to prevent its collapse. However, as Palat highlights, Nehru\u2019s vision was fraught with ambiguities. He viewed panchayats as both democratic and bureaucratic extensions, expressed dismay over the rise of opportunists in the electoral system, and feared that democracy was breeding an elective aristocracy and oligarchy. \nNehru lamented the absence of a two-party system in India but keenly observed an ideological dichotomy between Congress and Hindutva, presciently suggesting that these ideologies could evolve into distinct parties. While Nehru valued moral ideals, his inspirations\u2014Buddha, Ashoka, Akbar, and Gandhi\u2014were not unequivocal democrats. Gandhi, though a democratic mobilizer, was autocratic in his methods. Nehru himself emerged as the most consistent symbol of democratic idealism but rejected the notion of a personality cult as vulgar and absurd. \nPalat\u2019s lecture delves into Nehru\u2019s ambivalence towards democracy: he despised its tendency to favor mediocrity yet feared that inspiration and charisma often led to right-wing politics, which he deplored. Nehru\u2019s political philosophy lay in reconciling contradictions and embracing ambiguities, favoring the pragmatism of a conservative over the ideological rigidity of a socialist. \nBy drawing on his extensive work with the Nehru Archives, Palat offers fresh insights into Nehru\u2019s thought and legacy, portraying him as a leader navigating the complex interplay of ideals and realities with remarkable dexterity, even as he remained a figure defined by paradoxes and inconsistencies. \nPresented by: \n \n",
