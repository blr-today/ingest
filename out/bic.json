    "description": "The Bengaluru Debates: A BIC\u2013Janaagraha Dialogue Series on Urban Governance in Bengaluru and Beyond aims to expand civic space in the city by fostering conversations through a civic lens. The series is designed to be informative, constructive, and entertaining, while also serving as a trigger for local community action. Its objective is to bridge the gap between policy, practice, and public discourse on urban governance challenges, and to catalyse citizen and policymaker engagement towards systemic solutions. \nThe inaugural session will examine: \u201cCan the GBG Act deliver for Bengaluru?\u201d. Enacted in 2025, the GBG Act is a landmark legislation intended to strengthen Bengaluru\u2019s governance. This session will assess whether the Act can deliver on its promise and what it means for the future of the city. \nThe programme will feature a city-systems assessment of the GBG Act, followed by a 45-minute panel discussion and an interactive audience Q&A. The panellists are Mr. V Ravichander, Civic Evangelist and member of the GBG Act Advisory Committee, Shri Tejasvi Surya MP \u2013 Bangalore South and Shri Rizwan Arshad MLA \u2013 Shivajinagar. Mr. Srikanth Viswanathan, CEO of Janaagraha, will moderate the discussion.\u00a0 \nThrough this series, BIC and Janaagraha seek to build a widely followed platform for civic dialogue, citizen awareness, and informed media narratives on urban issues. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nJanaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, founded in 2001 in Bengaluru, is dedicated to transforming the quality of life in India\u2019s cities and towns. Their mission is to strengthen the systems of urban governance so that cities can deliver clean, green, safe, and liveable environments for all citizens. For them, \u201cquality of life\u201d is not only about infrastructure and services, but equally about responsive institutions, citizen engagement, and transparent, data-driven governance. \n",

    "description": "Hailed by CBC Music as one of Canada\u2019s finest young musicians, pianist\u00a0Tony Yike Yang\u00a0first captured international attention at just sixteen, when he became the youngest-ever laureate of the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. Since then, he has appeared in some of the world\u2019s leading concert halls, from Carnegie Hall and the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre to the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, performing with major orchestras including the Cleveland Orchestra, Warsaw Philharmonic, and Orchestre M\u00e9tropolitain. \nThis evening, he presents a programme that\u00a0traces a sweeping arc through the Romantic imagination. Scriabin\u2019s early Preludes open the program alongside his rarely heard Fantasy in B minor. Liszt follows with two contrasting masterpieces: the intimate Sonetto 104 del Petrarca, and the dazzling Mephisto Waltz No. 1, one of Liszt\u2019s most iconic showpieces. The program culminates in Chopin\u2019s Sonata in B minor. Together, these works highlight the Romantic piano\u2019s full expressive range, brought to life by Tony Yike Yang\u2019s artistry. \n \nSupported by: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n",

    "description": "How do centuries-old verses find new life in rhythm and movement? \nKABIR is a Bharatanatyam production that brings the timeless poetry of Sant Kabir into conversation with dance. What makes this work unique is the seamless weaving of Kabir\u2019s Hindi verses into the expressive framework of Bharatanatyam, guided by the musical brilliance of Vidwan O. S. Arun. His evocative vocals create a living bridge between word and movement, allowing the spiritual depth of Kabir\u2019s poetry to bloom on stage. \nConceived and choreographed by Varsha Akhouri, alumna and former faculty of the Kalakshetra Foundation, the production embodies both tradition and innovation. With her students carrying forward the performance, the piece becomes not just a retelling of Kabir\u2019s verses but a passing on of artistic legacy. \nKabir\u2019s words question dogma, transcend boundaries, and call us to simplicity, love, and self-realisation. In this production, poetry and dance converge to reveal their continued resonance with our fragmented world. \nA performance for the divine within and without. \nCredits:\nMusic and Vocals:\u00a0O S Arun\nConcept and Choreography:\u00a0Varsha Akhouri\nTabla: Martin\nMridangam: Shivaprasad\nSitar: Kishore\nFlute: Hariprasad\nSound engineer: Rakesh\nJathi: Sheejith Krishna\nLights: Venkatesh Krishna \nDancers:\nAsika Sajeevan\nAarathi S Nair\nDevika AC\nJisma K.K\nRoopesh PP\nShobhit Shivhare\nSreelakshmi EB\nSreeshna KM\nSreerejini NS \nSupported by: \n \n",

From knowing nothing about wine, she embarked on a gruelling decade-long pursuit of the world\u2019s most respected wine qualification. It will also explore her rise as one of the most trusted and popular voices in the alcobev space, emphasising the importance of self-investment, ambition without a blueprint, and chasing success without shortcuts. \nIn this candid conversation, Sonal will reveal what it takes to build a market from scratch and to lead with vision when no roadmap exists. Drawing from years of entrepreneurship, leadership, and global experience, she will offer a rare perspective on creating impact and shaping an industry against the odds.

He envisioned agricultural complexes powered by atomic energy, sea water turned drinkable, and a modern India fuelled by science and creativity. But Sarabhai was more than a scientist\u2014he co-founded the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, the National Institute of Design, the dance academy Darpana, and India\u2019s first textile research cooperative, ATIRA. He also ran a thriving pharmaceutical company and launched India\u2019s first market research organisation, ORG. \nAs India navigates its twenty-first century aspirations, this session revisits the humane, imaginative, yet pragmatic vision of a man who built enduring institutions. Drawing from Vikram Sarabhai: A Life, author Amrita Shah offers an intimate portrait of a multifaceted genius whose legacy continues to shape India\u2019s present and future. She will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey, exploring the many lives and lasting vision of this extraordinary builder of modern India. \nThe conversation will conclude with an audience Q&A. \n",

    "description": "Can dance translate the restlessness of a conscience, the weight of compassion? \nWith Gandhi, choreographer C P Satyajit reimagines the Mahatma\u2019s life and philosophy through the timeless language of Bharatanatyam. This is not a chronological retelling, but a meditation on his ideals: his restless pursuit of truth, his unwavering sense of justice, his profound connection with people. \nThrough delicate abhinaya and layered rhythmic improvisations, the production traces Gandhi\u2019s journey as both a leader and a seeker. Informed by the research of Dr. V R Devika, whose PhD explored Gandhi\u2019s communication strategies, the work captures how his ideals might continue to move us, literally and metaphorically, today.\n\nIn this unique performance, every gesture is a reminder that truth and compassion remain unfinished tasks. \nCredits:\nConcept & Choreography:\u00a0C P Satyajit \nDancers:\nKeerthana Ganesan\nDevikha S\nHemavathy Kalaiarasan\nParvathi Parameswar\nArchana Sivasubramanian\nAnjannaa Ashok \nMusicians\nM S Sukhi: Rhythm\nMonali Bala: Voice\nManonmani T: Sarangi \nOriginal Lighting Design: Martin Jose\nOperated by: Muthukumar R \nThe production is created by Bharata Kalanjali with the support of the Kaladham Trust and Sarvodaya International, Karnataka. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n\u00a0 \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "The ancient Indian Panchanga, or Hindu calendar, is a remarkable synthesis of astronomy, mathematics, and cultural tradition. This unique event brings it alive using modern Stellarium astronomy software, where celestial movements will be visualised through simple planetary animations. \nParticipants will learn the meaning of terms like\u00a0Masa, Paksha, Tithi, and Nakshatra, and discover why our festivals shift dates each year, why months have 30 or 31 days, why there are 12 zodiac signs, and why exactly 27 nakshatras govern the skies. These everyday questions find their answers in the ingenious design of the Panchanga. \nThe session also highlights the rich heritage of the Hindu school of astronomy. Flourishing for over 1,500 years and reaching a peak during the Vijayanagar period, with Kerala as its vibrant epicenter, this tradition produced profound insights into planetary motion and time. The ancient text\u00a0Surya Siddhanta\u00a0went even further, defining multiple scales of time\u2014from a human day (sunrise to sunrise), to a day of the Pitrs (a lunar month), to a day of the gods (a solar year). It even stretched the imagination to the grand cosmic cycles of\u00a0parardha\u2014155.52 trillion years\u2014down to the fleeting span of\u00a0prana, a few seconds. \nBy blending science with storytelling, speaker\u00a0S. Kishore Kumar\u00a0will reveal how the Hindu calendar is not just a tool for marking festivals, but a timeless scientific framework that connects human life to the rhythms of the cosmos. \nPresented by:\n \nSupported by:\n  \n",

    "description": "82 minutes | English | 2024 | India \nWhat does it mean to face the end on one\u2019s own terms\u2014and in the company of friends?\n\nA Fly on the Wall, directed by Nilesh Maniyar and Shonali Bose, traces the final chapter in the life of Chika Kapadia, framed through the intimate lens of friendship. In a quiet Swiss town, loved ones gather from across the world to raise a last toast, while a filmmaker friend documents the delicate passage between celebration and farewell. What unfolds is a tender meditation on choice, companionship, and the courage to define one\u2019s own ending. \nLayered with memory and emotion, the film draws viewers into a journey where the everyday collides with the profound, and where the act of bearing witness becomes as significant as the story itself. \nAfter the screening, directors Nilesh Maniyar and\u00a0Shonali Bose will be present for an in-person discussion with Sandhya Kumar, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \nCheck out the trailer here \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "67 minutes | Kannada, English and Hindi with English subtitles | Germany, India | 2025 \nOn January 22, 2024, much of India came to a halt as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a grand temple to Lord Ram, built on the contested site of a demolished mosque. The spectacle, meticulously staged, gave the ruling party a decisive advantage ahead of the 2024 Indian elections, further splintering an already divided opposition. \nSangama\u00a0is a powerful portrait of democracy at work in Southern India. The film follows the campaign of Wake-up Karnataka (WK), a citizen-led coalition mobilizing national networks to challenge the decade-long dominance of the BJP. \nJourneying with Team WK, by train, car, and on foot, the film captures their efforts to steer clear of polarizing rhetoric and instead spotlight urgent, everyday issues: unemployment, farmer distress, and the rising cost of essentials. \u201cOur tradition has taught us to love and not hate,\u201d one senior member affirms, encapsulating their ethos. \nFrom intimate community meetings and voter registration drives to the energy of massive political rallies, an intricate mosaic of the Indian election unfolds. Voices from the ground echo the people\u2019s concerns: \u201cModi may have done a lot for the rich, but daily wagers haven\u2019t benefited at all.\u201d \nAs the summer intensifies, so do the campaigns\u2014and with them, caste-based clashes stirred by political forces. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister amplifies anti-Muslim rhetoric, unsettled that strident Hindu nationalism is losing its appeal. Protests demanding accountability from pliant election officials expose the unevenness of the playing field. Through it all, Team WK persists, moving village to village, booth to booth, ensuring that people cast their votes. \nCommissioned by the Centre for Modern Indian Studies, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, the film is part of Election Diaries 2024,\u00a0a series of nine campaigns across India that celebrate the resilience of democracy. At a time when authoritarian regimes are on the rise and narrow visions of nationhood threaten to erase cultural plurality, Sangama\u00a0reminds us that an alternative vision of collective resistance and unity endures. \nThe screening will be followed by an interactive discussion with Tara Rao, Noor Sridhar and Mallige Sirimane from Eddelu Karnataka, and filmmaker Sunanda Bhat. The session, moderated by Pooja Prasanna, will conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \n",
