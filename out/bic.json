Immerse yourself in the vibrant world of Yakshagana, the ancient theatrical art form from coastal Karnataka. This programme combines live performance, interactive demonstrations, and cultural education to bring you closer to one of India\u2019s most dynamic traditional art forms. \nBegin your journey in our foyer (6pm), where master artists demonstrate the intricate makeup techniques that transform performers into mythological characters. You can also get a close look at the authentic costumes and ornate headgear used in the performances. \nThe main program (6:30pm) takes you through the complete journey of a Yakshagana performance, from the sacred Chowki Pooje ritual to a captivating final act. Watch as artists demonstrate the art of transformation through costume and makeup, learn about the powerful musical traditions with live demonstrations of the Chende and Maddale, and even try your hand at basic Abhinaya (expressions) alongside seasoned performers. \nThe evening culminates in a spellbinding 30-minute Yakshagana performance, the perfect blend of music, dance, dialogue, and costume in this centuries-old storytelling tradition. Throughout the event, the\u00a0Sutradar (narrator) guides you through each element (in English and Kannada), offering insights into the cultural significance and artistic nuances of this magnificent art form. \nWhether you\u2019re a cultural enthusiast, performing arts lover, or simply curious about Indian traditional theater, this immersive experience offers a rare glimpse into the heart of Yakshagana, where tradition meets interaction, and ancient stories come alive through spectacular performance. \nThis is the first performance of our new series\u00a0BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka\u2019s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation.

    "description": "Maag reimagines Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth as a dystopian tale set in the ancient settlement of Burzohm, deeply embedded within the rich cultural tapestry of Kashmir. This opera unfolds in lyrical Kashmiri verse, seamlessly blending the traditional folk theatre of Bhaand Pather with avant-garde, post-postmodern performance art. Conceived by the Theatre for Kashmir team, Maag pushes the boundaries of theatrical expression through daring performance design and innovative storytelling techniques that challenge conventional norms. \nThe opera\u2019s minimalist cast underscores its experimental ethos, with each performer inhabiting multiple roles, shifting identities with effortless precision. This approach not only highlights the versatility of the actors but also reflects the opera\u2019s exploration of fractured identities and the fluidity of power. Central to the narrative are three enigmatic shamans\u2014personified as a Cat, Hyena, and Raven\u2014whose striking physicality and symbolic costumes evoke ancient archetypes, each embodying a distinct facet of influence, manipulation, and fate. Their presence weaves an otherworldly thread through the story, amplifying the opera\u2019s dark, atmospheric undertones while anchoring it in the mythic and the timeless. \nComplementing Maag is a special musical performance, Dastaan-e-Sama, presented by the ensemble\u2019s Sufiyana musicians. Dastaan-e-Sama is a captivating journey through the mystical traditions of Kashmir, blending rich storytelling, soul-stirring music, and evocative raqs (sacred dance). Together, Maag and Dastaan-e-Sama offer a profound exploration of Kashmir\u2019s cultural and spiritual heritage, inviting audiences into a space where ancient traditions meet contemporary artistic innovation. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

A celebrated passenger Indian, Mohandas Gandhi, went to Natal in 1893. A decade later, an undistinguished passenger Indian, Mohanlal, the great-grandfather of author Amrita Shah, arrived in Natal. As a child growing up in India, she was fascinated by the mystery surrounding her ancestor\u2019s journey. Why had he gone there? What was the name of the woman he met along the way, who gave birth to her grandmother? And did he know Gandhi? \nThere were no clues at home\u2014no reminiscences, letters, documents, memorabilia, not even a photograph. She embarked on a search for her wandering forefather with limited expectations, but doors opened serendipitously, and a paper trail emerged, strewn across archives in South Africa, Mauritius, the UK, and India. This search provided answers but also revealed the immense value in researching a seemingly ordinary man\u2019s history. \nAmrita Shah, author of The Other Mohan: In Britain\u2019s Indian Ocean Empire, will be in conversation with Ramjee Chandran to discuss the book\u2019s findings, including new revelations about Gandhi\u2019s Satyagraha campaign.

Among the most complex works of Karnad, it is based on the myth of Yavakri from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, and is an innovative reimagining of the epic\u2019s characters and events a retelling of a lesser-known episode from the epic in which the Khandava forest is burned down by Agni, the fire god, with the help of Arjuna and Krishna to provide a sacrificial alter. \nKarnad combines multiple myths to explore contemporary social, cultural, political, and psychological issues. Symbolism and allegories add to the depth of its narrative, making it a thought-provoking yet visually stunning experience. Known for its play-within-the-play method to depict the deception of brothers against brothers and fratricide and its timeless themes, the play continues to remain a significant work in the field of Indian theater and has been performed in multiple languages and at numerous theatre festivals. \nDirector \u2013 Abhinav Grover\nLights \u2013 Trisha Shetty\nSound \u2013 Amrit\nCostumes, Make up & Set Design -Shruti Bangera\nAssistant Director \u2013\u00a0Trisha Shetty \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "A symphony of brilliance, HH Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar, the 25th and last Maharaja of Mysore, transcended the throne. More than a king, he was a polymath, his reign a testament to the harmonious blend of administrative acumen and artistic fervor. His love for music transcended borders, encompassing both the rich tradition of Carnatic music and the elegance of Western classical. \nCrowned amidst the tempestuous winds of change, he navigated turbulent times with a visionary\u2019s zeal. He upheld the legacy of Mysore with an unwavering dignity, his reign a beacon of honor and integrity. When the dawn of Indian Independence broke, he gracefully relinquished his crown, a statesman who paved the path for the unification of princely states into the nascent nation. \nHis humility, a rare jewel in the crown of royalty, remains an enduring testament to his character. Though time may have dimmed the spotlight, the echoes of his extraordinary life and the profound impact of his reign continue to reverberate through the heart of Mysore, where he forever remains a beloved, though tragically unsung, hero. \nThe session will start with a 10 minutes film about\u00a0HH Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar, created by MAYA Films. This will be followed by a talk by\u00a0Dr. Sudhamani in Kannada.\u00a0Dr. Deepti Navaratna will deliver a talk on the musical genius of the Maharaja in English. A discussion between\u00a0Dr. Sudhamani, Dr. Deepti and Maya Chandra will follow. The session will end with a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "The Union Budget on February 1 was crucial\u2014it marked the first full-fledged budget of PM Modi\u2019s third term and sets the course for Viksit Bharat@2047. The government has repeatedly claimed that India is on track to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy. \nYet, concerns persist. The second quarter of FY25 recorded a modest 5.4% growth\u2014raising the question: Is India losing momentum? Global economic uncertainties, shifting trade policies, and rising protectionism add further complexity. \nDoes this Budget introduce decisive measures to reignite growth amid these headwinds? Can a bold move\u2014such as significantly raising the non-taxable income threshold\u2014spur consumption? \nThis discussion will take a sharp, analytical look at Budget 2025\u2014its promises, its pitfalls, and its potential impact on India\u2019s economic trajectory. \n",

    "description": "This talk will reflect on broad trends in the study of caste including debates and discussions drawing on poststructuralist, Marxist, and anthropological approaches which have tended to approach caste as a distinctive form of hierarchy and social distinction. This framing will help to illuminate the challenge of new approaches and intellectual formations, which center critical caste and Dalit studies, scholarship on anticaste thought, and studies of global caste. \nHow does a politics of the present inflect social transformations of caste, as well as the resistance to its inequities? What are the potentials and the perils to studying caste through global fields of power and comparison? How might we bridge institutional logics and disciplinary constraints in effecting novel forms of critique? \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Anupama Rao delivers a talk. This is an excerpt from an event that took place in the BIC premises in December 2024. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Overcast, Audible, and Amazon Music. \n",

    "description": "This is not a solo |\u00a023 min |\u00a0Vanessa Vieira da Cunha\n(De)construction. The hidden. The exposed. What is. What was. What it no longer is but could be again. Antagonistic relationships create space for a gray place, the place that inhabits what is not yet one thing or the other. This is not a solo aims to research and deepen issues related to identity, the exposure of the self, the importance we attribute to the set of qualities and particularities that we think define us, the place of confrontation with the vision of the another, the dizzying sensation of detaching ourselves from what is known and comfortable to reveal inner layers that remain inaccessible to others.\n \nEgo | Echo |\u00a015 min |\u00a0Indrek Kornel\nA dialogue between self and surroundings, Ego | Echo explores the interplay of reflection an resonance. Hyper-aware of the textures, sounds, tastes, and rhythms of the here and now, the performer navigates the constant feedback loop between their body and the world around them. How does the echo of their presence alter the ego of their being? In this improvised journey, they let each moment reshape them\u2014a push and pull between intention and instinct, order and chaos, heaven and hell. It is a movement through the shifting landscapes of self and space, where the only constant is the present. \nFloating Clouds |\u00a015 min |\u00a0Abhilash Ningappa\nFloating Clouds is a contemplative performance that examines the complexities of life through the lens of artistic expression. It reflects on the universal challenges, aspirations, and fleeting triumphs that shape the human experience The piece combines expressive dance, spoken word, and symbolic gestures to create a rich tapestry of movement and meaning. The choreography, marked by fluidity and grace, evokes the transient beauty of clouds, offering a metaphor for the impermanence of life. Spoken text serves as a bridge, drawing the audience into the narrative and fostering a shared space of reflection. Through its interplay of movement and language. Floating Clouds invites audiences to engage with themes of transformation, resilience, and the ephemeral nature of existence.\n \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "\u2018There may be a time, Guardian, when it doesn\u2019t matter whether our peace is founded on the truth or a lie. All that matters is that there be peace. Would you consider the possibility that that time is now?\u2019 \nAn impoverished young man, Jagat, is found guilty of murder. For his crime, he is sentenced to the highest form of punishment\u2014the sleep of death for a century, with the promise of revival should his innocence ever be proven. \nBut his act sparks violence in the great city of Peruma, with the Commune, an anarchist collective of workers, revolting against the Council, which has ruled Peruma for four hundred years. Drained by endless conflict, Council and Commune negotiate a hundred-year treaty that is to be enforced by an impartial body: the guardians of the Confederation. \nAnd now, a century later, the Charter is a week away from lapsing. Tensions run high in Peruma. As an uncertain future looms, Nila, a young guardian, is approached by a mysterious woman who insists that Jagat\u2019s case be reopened before it\u2019s too late. Drawn by the prospect of undoing a possible historical injustice, Nila agrees. But as she begins to unearth the past, forces, known and unknown, thwart her at every turn. \nWhat secrets does the city hold? Who is working in the shadows against her\u2014and why? What is the price of resurrecting a martyr? Gautam Bhatia\u2019s\u00a0The Sentence\u00a0raises questions about justice, rights and ethics that will echo in your mind long after you\u2019ve turned the last page.\u00a0It is about how the fate of many rests on the decision of one person\u2014a decision that might tear a city into two. \nGautam Bhatia will be in conversation with Shrabonti Bagchi.\u00a0An audience Q&A session will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Of all regions of India, the Deccan has the most diverse architectural traditions, nowhere better shown than in the variety of stone temples sponsored under a succession of dynasties which ruled peninsular India over some 700 years. To illustrate this unique diversity, Michell explores religious monuments at lesser-known sites. He begins with Early Chalukya temples overlooking the Tungabhadra river at Alampur, and ends with the imposing Kakatiya monument at the out of the way village of Palampet, both in Telangana. In between, he discusses the Nolamaba period shrines at Nandi and Shravana Belgola, and those of the Later Chalukyas at Sudi, Kuruvatti and Lakkundi, all in Karnataka. He concludes with the little visited Hoysala period shrines at Belavadi, Mosale and Agraha Bachhahalli. \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A Session with the audience. \nImage credit \u2013 Surendra Kumar \nIn collaboration with:\n\u00a0 \n",
