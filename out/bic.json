    "description": "A tool is only as good as the hands that wield it. \nAnd AI is, after all, another tool. \nThis talk explores how Artificial Intelligence functions as a collaborator for creativity: accelerating exploration, provoking new directions, and sharpening creative judgment. The session opens with live demonstrations that surface instinctive reactions to AI-generated content, then lifts the veil on how these systems actually work and why their outputs can feel genuinely creative. No jargon, just clarity on what\u2019s happening under the hood and why it\u2019s more interesting than you might expect. \nA live co-creation segment puts theory into practice. Using tools like ChatGPT, Suno, and Midjourney, the session demonstrates real creative workflows in action. You\u2019ll discover that the power lives in iteration, selection, and rejection, revealing how human judgment shapes everything that emerges from these systems. \nAI represents the next generation of creative tools, shifting how creation happens, not why it happens. Intent remains yours. Taste remains yours. Meaning remains yours. The talk concludes by exploring the questions that make this moment genuinely intriguing: authorship, originality, bias, ethics. As AI makes output abundant and accessible, your context, lived experience, and values determine what\u2019s worth making in the first place. \n",

    "description": "A new dawn was breaking. And its light would reach far beyond its time. \nRebellion in Verse\u00a0unfolds a journey that goes back to the sixth century CE; a time when many yearned for a reprieve from the constraints of Vedic orthodoxy and caste hierarchies. The Tamil Bhakti movement emerged as their clarion call, a grassroots surge of devotion that redefined spirituality and the social fabric itself. The saints of this movement were poets of the people, composing their hymns in Tamil and their verses, brimming with simplicity and profundity, wrestled divine wisdom from the elite grip of Sanskrit and handed it to the masses. \nThis conversation around\u00a0Raghavan Srinivasan\u2019s book Rebellion in Verse, explores how poetry has long served as a space of defiance: challenging hierarchy, authority, and inherited social orders. Drawing from Bhakti and other traditions, the discussion reflects on how verse carried ideas of equality, desire, and resistance, and why these voices continue to matter today. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

The second edition of this festival, The Body As Space, explores how we experience the world through sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. \nOver eight days, the festival becomes a journey through sensation. Classical melodies meet olfactory landscapes. Contemporary dance transforms into tactile dialogue. Installations immerse you in sound, scent, and memory itself. Conversations uncover India\u2019s forgotten sensory archives and trace the origins of instruments that changed how we listen. \nWe invite you to tune into what you\u2019ve always carried: the intelligence of your body, the stories held in your senses. \nFull schedule to be announced soon! \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "You know this story. \nA death in the royal family. A ghost with demands. A protagonist tipping toward madness, or something that looks like it. Revenge as the only logical conclusion. \nPut a woman in the centre. The axis shifts. \nDoes the ghost get believed? Does the grief get room, or a diagnosis? And what happens when the ghost doesn\u2019t ask for revenge at all, but tells her daughter to protect herself through education? \nPrincess Hamlet is twenty, home from college, fluent in manga and martial arts, and entirely unprepared for what her mother\u2019s ghost is asking of her. Adishakti\u2019s production departs sharply from Shakespeare, and in that departure, asks what we\u2019ve always taken for granted about grief, power, and who gets to act on either. \nWritten, adapted and directed by Vinay Kumar.

    "description": "Drawing from Commedia dell\u2019arte, clowning, and physical theatre, this workshop puts the body first. It explores how physical action, form, and rhythm can unlock imagination, presence, and emotional life in ways that psychological approaches alone cannot. \nDeveloped in collaboration with La Compagnie Dramatique, whose long-running, critically acclaimed comedy\u00a0by Dario Fo,\u00a0The Open Couple, has been in repertoire since 2013, this workshop offers an inside look at the playful, high-energy physical tools used in making a full-scale professional production, and how they are shaped into clear, dynamic storytelling. \nWho It\u2019s For \nFor actors and theatre practitioners, this workshop loosens habitual patterns, rebuilds physical ease, and rediscovers play. It is particularly useful if you feel blocked, overly cerebral, or curious about comedy and physical performance. \nFor writers, directors, educators, or anyone curious about how performers work, the principles here extend well beyond the stage. Presence, adaptability, attention, and expressive freedom are skills that land anywhere. \nCuriosity, openness, and a willingness to play are enough. \nInside the Workshop \n\nDiscover the impact of exaggeration, contrast and neutrality\u00a0\nWitness the relationship between physical form and inner state\nExperience mindful presence, unburdened play, and the pleasure of being seen\nLearn to make an audience lean in with physical storytelling, rhythm, and clarity\nLearn how these tools are ultimately shaped in service of text and performance\n\nParticipants will engage with the kinds of physical, rhythmic, and embodied approaches that are used in the making of a full-scale professional production. The workshop offers an inside look at how playful, high-energy physical exploration is later shaped, refined, and structured into clear storytelling and performance craft. The workshop is designed not for mastery in a single session, but for opening doors: to imagination, confidence, and a deeper appreciation of theatrical craft. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "Krishna\u2019s flute has been stopping the world for centuries. \nGopis mid-chore. Lotuses mid-bloom. Cows mid-graze. Everything bends toward that sound. \nShan Bhatnagar\u2019s hand moves across cloth, Krishna taking form as the painting grows. Amrita Lahiri becomes the story, Kuchipudi\u2019s precise geometry turning devotion into movement. Hrishikesh Majumdar plays the flute that started it all. \nPichwai is stillness, detail, meditation. Kuchipudi is energy, expression, the body as instrument. One from Nathadwara\u2019s havelis, one from Andhra\u2019s temple courtyards. A thousand kilometres between them, the same longing underneath. \nIt begins with the flute, then the painting blooms, and the dance answers. \nSomewhere in the space between sound, movement, and image, devotion becomes tangible. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

From the earth beneath us, from the quiet wisdom within, from the stillness we once knew. \nCommissioned by Kalavaahini Trust on the occasion of their 10th Anniversary, Viyoga is a dance performance that moves through the fractures of our time. \nBuilt on the premise of loss, it explores how our harmony with nature quietly fades, how the narcissistic self eclipses the deeper truth within, and how unbridled material desires overshadow the spiritual depth that sustains us. \nThrough movement and silence, Viyoga asks us to pause, witness, and rediscover what binds us. \nProduction Credits: \nConcept, Choreography & Lead: Vaibhav Arekar\nCreative Consultant: Malavika Sarukkas\nMusic Composition & Vocal: Karthik Hebbar\nLights & Costumes: Sushant Jadhav\nArtistic Director: Sushant Jadhav\nPercussion Design: Satish Krishnamurthy\nEnsemble: Eesha Pinglay, Swarada Bhave, Poorva Saraswat, Gautam Marathe, Anu Christi Pillai\nOrchestra: Madhuri Seshadri (Vocal), Suma Rani (Sitar), Shrinidhi Mattur (Violin), Shubha (Veena), Vivek Krishna (Flute), Venu (Keyboard)\nRecording: Omkar Studio, Bangalore (Shrinidhi Omkar)\nPoets: Kabir, Sharad Chandra, Sant Tukaram, Annamacharya, Da.

    "description": "A performance of Western classical music. But not quite your traditional piano recital. \nThe pieces are famous. Debussy, Scarlatti, Liszt, Grieg, Brahms, Sorabji, Copland. You may have heard some of them before. That is the point. Repetition does not preserve meaning, it changes it. The same notes, heard again, evoke different emotions. \nEach piece arrives with a scent. The music reaches you through the ear. The fragrance reaches you somewhere you can\u2019t quite name. Between the two, something surfaces: the specific, vivid kind of memory that belongs only to you. \nWoven through is a conversation about music, scent and sensation: how memory is invoked without words, without warning, without intention. \nThe piano is waiting. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

And between the two of them, an entire inner world comes alive. \nWho manipulates whom? \nWhat follows is a quiet, unsettling dance between light and shadow, memory and imagination.

In either case, it becomes a story to tell over coffee. \nBut who are the people on the other end of line? \nIn her new book, Scamlands, journalist\u00a0Snidha Poonam explores\u00a0the vast fraud economies stretching from small-town India to global scam hubs.\u00a0Nuanced, detailed and above all, personal, Poonam reports on the many lives that run parallel to our own.\u00a0Tracing the supply chains of fraud, she reveals an economy that\u2019s both ruthlessly efficient and heartbreakingly human. \nIn this talk, she is joined by columnist Aakar Patel to explore the themes of the book. They will examine how scam economies thrive in the gaps of inequality, why trust is collapsing faster than we can rebuild it, and what it means when fraud becomes a viable career path for an entire generation.

The local heroes nobody outside their village has heard of. The formats (Sevens, Khep, Basti tournaments) that have their own rules, their own rituals, their own worlds. The communities for whom football isn\u2019t a sport so much as a language. \nThis is football as identity, as belonging, as something worth fighting to keep alive. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A.

    "description": "Have you ever heard a kudamuzha? The five-faced drum disappeared centuries ago. As did the yaazh harp, the urumi, the parai. Instruments that once shaped Tamil ritual soundscapes, gone silent. \nUrupaanar brought them back. \nTHOL\u00a0is their debut album, the world\u2019s first recorded entirely on the yaazh. It\u2019s also a live performance, a sonic excavation of Tamil antiquity where music becomes a site of memory and landscape. Drawing from Sangam-era traditions, the eight-piece collective uses reconstructed ancient instruments to create sound that is both archival and immediate. \nThe performance follows the thinai system from Tolk\u0101ppiyam, which understands emotion as inseparable from environment. Mountains, forests, farmlands, seashores, arid regions: each landscape gives rise to distinct emotional states and rhythms. Feeling is shaped by climate, terrain, flora, sound, movement. Music emerges from ecology, carrying the textures of place and the sensorial conditions of lived life. \nNinety minutes of ancient sonic ecosystems reactivated in contemporary performance. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

That moment of surrender? That\u2019s the real mountain. \nIn this multimedia talk based on their new book,\u00a0What\u2019s Your Everest? (Bloomsbury), Samir and Sauraj strip the heroism from the world\u2019s highest peak. Through expedition films, fireside conversation, and an open Q&A, they unpack the unglamorous truth behind the glory of the summit: frostbitten hands at 8,000 meters, relief work after tragedy, and the brutal discipline of trying again. This is about failure, leadership, ego, and the invisible mountains we all face: ambition, burnout, fear, and the gap between wanting something and the willingness to suffer for it. \nWhat\u2019s your Everest?

    "description": "A single family. A small village. An entire nation\u2019s story hiding inside. \nTell Me A Story About Our World brings together academic and translator Vanamala Viswanatha and novelist Kavery Nambisan for a conversation about the art of fiction and storytelling, based on Nambisan\u2019s latest novel, Rising Sons. Set in a village in Karnataka, following one family from pre-independent India through to the 1970s, threading through the complexities of caste and colonialism while painting vivid landscapes of rural and urban life in a bygone era. \nWhat makes Rising Sons sing is how Nambisan inhabits her world. Kannada coexists comfortably within the English, not as a novelty but as a force of realism, enabling the reader\u2019s sensibility to percolate through society at every level. Then there is the narrator: never formally introduced, yet unmistakably present, speaking of \u201cour village\u201d and \u201cour daily lives\u201d with a voice that is not quite impartial. The resulting text reads as both narration and remembrance, an immersion into a carefully crafted world. \nThe stories we tell are as much about the Word as they are about the World. Expect an interesting and illuminating conversation, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n",

Damage transforms into something worth keeping. \nRed House brings this meditative practice to Bangalore after reaching over 20,000 participants across India. Their space in Okhla is itself a product of this philosophy: once an abandoned factory, it was converted into a thriving cultural hub in 2022. Now one of Delhi\u2019s pioneering hubs for this ancient art, Red House invites you to experience the ritual firsthand. \nThe process is simple but deliberate. Select a ceramic piece, break it with intention using a hammer, then carefully mend it, watching as golden seams emerge where cracks once lived. Traditional Kintsugi uses lacquer and gold powder in a painstaking, multi-step technique that can take weeks. This workshop offers a more accessible approach, allowing you to complete the full arc of breaking and repair in a single session. You\u2019ll leave with a vessel wearing its history openly, a reminder that our fractures, when tended to, can become the most beautiful part of us. \nAn act of creation that insists our faults and repairs are worth displaying. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "Bangalore smells. \nJasmine at dawn, petrol in traffic, filter coffee and wet earth after the first rain, incense curling through temple courtyards, garbage fermenting in afternoon heat. We live inside this rich olfactory landscape, but rarely pause to notice it. \nIndu Antony, however, has been mapping it for years. \nIn this 90-minute lecture-demonstration, Antony presents findings from V\u0101san\u00e9, Bangalore\u2019s first smell archive. Part urban anthropology, part sensory memoir, the work traces how scent carries memory, class, labour, and belonging in ways the visual record cannot. Smell resists documentation. It\u2019s intimate, fleeting, impossible to photograph. Which makes it a different kind of archive entirely. \nAntony walks you through her practice of mapping the city with her nose. The streets, markets, lakes, and corners where Bangalore announces itself before you see it. How smell marks territory, signals change, and holds what we\u2019ve lost. The lecture weaves fieldwork, personal narrative, and reflection on what it means to archive something so fugitive. \nThe session closes with a guided encounter: select scent-notes from the city, experienced in silence. An invitation to notice how your body remembers place beyond images and language. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year\u2019s festival is built around what we hear, smell, touch, taste, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music, contemporary dance, installations, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n",
