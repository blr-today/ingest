    "description": "India\u2019s sporting landscape has dramatically transformed over the past few decades. Traditionally dominated by cricket, the country has emerged as a powerhouse in multiple disciplines, including badminton, wrestling, boxing, and athletics. \nThe rise of leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Pro Kabaddi League, and Indian Super League (ISL) has played a crucial role in popularizing various sports and providing financial support to athletes. Additionally, India\u2019s improved performance in global events like the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, and Asian Games has boosted national pride.\u00a0Charu\u00a0Sharma with his decades of experience leading RCB and even conceptualizing Kabbadi League will tell this story. \nThe\u00a0Devatha Radhakrishna Memorial Lecture \nDevatha Radhakrishna was not only a visionary entrepreneur but a lifelong seeker\u2014curious, resilient, and deeply reflective. From building a thriving silk and garment empire to exploring law, organic farming, and philosophy, he approached every pursuit with passion and purpose. Even in adversity, he found meaning, drawing strength from the wisdom of D.V. Gundappa and Tolstoy. To him, business, literature, and spirituality were not separate paths but part of a single journey. This memorial lecture honours a life lived with conviction, curiosity, and an unyielding spirit. \nPresented by: Sriram Devatha. \n",

We begin by pausing\u2014through the lens of photographer Shalini Jain\u2014as she captures movement in stillness and the stories told in a dancer\u2019s fleeting gesture. From this quiet contemplation, we shift into the immediacy of the body: \u201cA Meeting,\u201d a contemporary duet by Gayatri Shetty and Ronita Mukherjee, explores presence, dialogue, and connection through movement. \nAs the evening deepens, we journey into \u201cThe World in Motion,\u201d a confluence of Indian classical forms\u2014Bharatanatyam, Odissi, and Kathak\u2014brought to life by Gauri Diwakar, Sujata Nair Sanjay, Minal Prabhu, and the Mudrika Foundation. Here, tradition is not static but ever evolving, and every step becomes a living archive. \nAcross these experiences, we celebrate dance not only as performance, but as conversation\u2014between bodies, between time periods, between disciplines.

    "description": "How do you capture something as fluid and ephemeral as dance \u2014 a gesture, a rhythm, a moment in motion? In this talk, photographer Shalini Jain shares her approach to photographing performance, where timing, intuition, and emotion come together to create images that resonate beyond the frame. Drawing from her work with dancers and musicians, she explores how stillness can reflect movement, and how the camera becomes a quiet partner in the act of performance. Through images and reflection, Shalini offers a glimpse into the art of seeing rhythm and holding on to what might otherwise be lost in a blink. \nThis event is part of our International Dance Day celebrations Echoes of the Moving Body. \n",

    "description": "As a part of World Dance Day celebrations, this session will celebrate the rich tapestry of Indian classical dance by showcasing a curated blend of solo, duet, and group performances, each representing diverse classical traditions from across the country. \nHari Ho\u2026Gati Meri\nA Solo by Gauri Diwakar \nHari Ho\u2026Gati Meri (let my salvation be in the supreme) is a statement of \u201cYou\u201d. It is a search for salvation, truth and for beauty.\nBased on the poetry of Sayyad Fazlul Hasan popularly known as Maulana Hasrat Mohani, the work revolves around the eternal resonance of Krishna\u2019s flute.\nIs the melody emerging out of Krishna\u2019s flute a message beckoning to eternal life or the fount of ever\u00a0increasing knowledge?\nI search you else where, ignorant me! Waiting, waiting and letting life go by, while you reside within the deepest core of me. Let my senses be open to you, within me.\nI hear the flute, I see the melody, I feel the love! \nCredits :\nConcept & Research : Sanjay Nandan\nChoreography :\u00a0 Aditi Mangaldas\nMusic composition, vocals & harmonium: Samiullah Khan \nNatya Samanwayam\nA Duet by Sujatha Nair and Gururaju \nOur Indian classical dances bear testimony to the national ethos of Unity in Diversity. Multiple forms, Single spirit. Here is an attempt to reaffirm this unique trait of our country, through the coming together of two of our popular classical dance styles; Kuchipudi & Mohiniyattam.\u00a0 Adhering to the traditions and flavors of individual styles, blending seamlessly, an amalgamation of visual beauty and serenity is created. This is an invocatory piece that sees the blend of a Marathi Nirupan which is abhinaya oriented with a Swathitirunal Kriti, a Nritta composition, Tillana. \nAnadi Ananta: The Seamless One\nA Group Performance by Minal Prabhu & Mudrika\u00a0Foundation for Indian Performing Arts \nThis piece is inspired by Advaita Vedanta, where Brahman is the ultimate, singular truth and all other manifestations are mere illusions of that truth. Jagat Chaitanya- the beam of light, the Parabrahman, symbolizes the eternal cycle of creation and destruction\u2014without beginning or end. Shiva\u2019s cosmic dance embodies this rhythm of life, death and rebirth. Through the rhythm created by his movement, breath, damaru and the sweat that fell off his dancing body, he created the Pancha Bhootas, the five elements \u2013 Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Space, which form the foundation of existence. \nThe manifestation of these elements is the manifestation of Brahman itself. With this production, we bow to Parabrahman through the ethereal embodiment of the Pancha Bhootas. \nThis event is part of our International Dance Day celebrations Echoes of the Moving Body. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "A Meeting is embedded in the tumultuous emotional and physical dynamics between its two characters, highlighting the complexities of human connection and the emotional landscape of desire and disconnection. What connections are able to form if we simply allow and make space and stop? It evokes reflection on the meaning of love, the nature of relationships and the interplay between connection and solitude. The dancers will meet themselves from different timelines of their life and what happens to the present when the past and future meet. It is a love letter to all that once was and is.\nDancers will draw from their own lives to showcase the push and pull of relationships, emphasizing moments of intense connection, followed by periods of emotional and physical dissonance, reflecting their internal and external conflicts.\nAt a point in this world when our global unity and resistance is so essential, our daily human connections seem to be falling apart.

    "description": "The early medieval period in South Karnataka was a time of vigorous cultural change. Between the 10th and 13th centuries CE, it became a frontier region between the sprawling Chola and Chalukya empires, allowing for migration, the development of new trade networks, and the rise of innovative temple cultures. Tamil peasant-warriors and traders settled in South Karnataka, significantly contributing to the region\u2019s already cosmopolitan character\u2014an influence still visible in the temple architecture of Bengaluru and its vicinity. The Chola presence also introduced new models of royal power that shaped the emerging Hoysala dynasty. Drawing on architectural, art historical, and epigraphical material, Anirudh Kanisetti examines the Chola impact on South Karnataka and how it continues to shape Bengaluru\u2019s urbanism today.

Mystics, poets and saints spanning many centuries and regions have extensively used the metaphor of the clay pot to talk about the fragility of the human body and the enormous possibilities of human existence. \nIn this performance titled The Universe in a Pot, musicians Sumana and Saitejas bring together a sonic and a lyrical experience centred around the simple clay pot. The performance takes the audience on a musical journey that blends together the diverse soundscapes that are possible on this simple yet powerful instrument, along with songs, stories and poetry of the mystics that celebrate the pot. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "English | 73 mins | India | 2025 \nIn an era where our lives increasingly depend on satellites for everything from communication to weather forecasting, The Dirty Sky delves into the escalating crisis of orbital debris \u2013 the uncontrolled trash accumulating in space. Through a detailed exploration of the history of satellite launches, the film sheds light on the exponential increase in non-functional satellites, leading to a severe threat to our orbital environment and space sustainability. It underscores the growing dangers posed by orbital debris, which, much like terrestrial pollution, is an unseen but pervasive threat to space activities. The Dirty Sky emphasizes the urgency for global awareness and action. It advocates for the public and world leaders to raise a concerted voice, urging competing nations and commercial companies to take concrete steps before our beautiful sky becomes as uninhabitable as the polluted seas and air on Earth \u2013 the only home humanity has. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A session with the filmmaker. \n\u00a0 \n",

    "description": "The fiercest wars are fought between siblings. \nTara, a successful Delhi lawyer, is everything her younger brother isn\u2019t: dedicated, independent, thriving. When their beloved father retires, he summons them to a meeting. But what he has to say threatens to tear the family apart.
