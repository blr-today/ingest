    "description": "K\u0101lid\u0101sa never met K\u016b\u1e6diy\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dam. Until now. \nNepathya presents a scene from Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam, K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s most celebrated play: the moment when Du\u1e63yanta and \u015aakuntal\u0101 meet and fall in love.\u00a0Conceived and designed by Guru Margi Madhu Chakyar, this adaptation brings together what history kept apart. \nIn this adaptation, the S\u016bta enacts Du\u1e63yanta\u2019s actions. Du\u1e63yanta mirrors the deer. His responses echo \u015aakuntal\u0101\u2019s movements. What emerges is emotions synchronizing across bodies, a complementary interplay that grew from attempting the impossible. \nK\u016b\u1e6diy\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dam stretches time. A gesture can last minutes. A glance becomes an entire emotional landscape. What you see is intensity, immediacy, and a particular kind of attention. \nK\u0101lid\u0101sa. K\u016b\u1e6diy\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dam. They meet at last. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year\u2019s festival is built around what we hear, smell, touch, taste, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music, contemporary dance, installations, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "Born from a vision to unite masters and experimentalists on a single stage, Prav\u0101ha debuted in 2024. The second edition of this festival, The Body As Space, explores how we experience the world through sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. \nOver eight days, the festival becomes a journey through sensation. Classical melodies meet olfactory landscapes. Contemporary dance transforms into tactile dialogue. Installations immerse you in sound, scent, and memory itself. Conversations uncover India\u2019s forgotten sensory archives and trace the origins of instruments that changed how we listen. \nWe invite you to tune into what you\u2019ve always carried: the intelligence of your body, the stories held in your senses. \nRSVP for the events you\u2019d like to attend here. \nFestival Schedule: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\nArtist\nNature\nTimings\n\n\nFeb 22 \u2013 Mar 1\nHistories of Indian Perfume\nOn a Scented Trail\nThe Marg Foundation\nExhibition\n11am \u2013 9pm\n\n\nFeb 22 \u2013 Mar 1\nFirst-Hand\nA Multisensorial Pause for Rest, Attention, and Care\nFor Ages 15+\nNitish Jain\nPaticipatory Immersive Experience\nFeb 22 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 23 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 24 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 25 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 26 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 27 \u2013 3pm, 7pm\nFeb 28 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\nMar 1 \u2013 11am, 3pm, 7pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nV\u0101san\u00e9\nOlfactory Archives of Bangalore\nIndu Antony\nLecture Demonstration\n11:30am \u2013 1pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nGrounded: A Food and Body Coffee Lab\nA Sensorial Exploration of Coffee, Memory, and Land\nShubhra Chatterji\nWorkshop\n4pm \u2013 6:30pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nTHOL\nReconstructing Tamil Antiquity Through Revived Instruments and Contemporary Songwriting\nUrupaanar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 23\nCall of the Flute\nA Coming Together of Pichwai Paintings, Kuchipudi Dance, and Flute\nAmrita Lahiri, Shan Bhatnagar & Hrishikesh Majumdar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 24\nNotes That Linger\nSounds and Scents Mingling in the Evening Air\nKarl Lutchmayer\nImmersive Performance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 25\nThe Far Post\nPhysical Theatre With Masks, Puppetry and Music\nFor Ages 12+\nYuki Ellias, Priyanshu Gupta, Sumaiya Merchant, Mati Rajput, Arnob Bal, Phalguni Vittal Rao, Priyanka Babbar & Sanket Parkhe\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 26\nNavrasa and I\nReliving the Rasas Through Raagas\nIndrayuddh Majumdar & Roopak Kallurkar\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 9pm\n\n\nFeb 27\nA Woman Or Not to Be\nA Bold Reimagining of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet Through the Eyes of a Woman\nFor Ages 12+\nAdishakti Laboratory for Theatre Art Research\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nThe Percussive Pathway\nA Brief Foray into the Wondrous World of Percussion\nRahul Vanamali\nInteractive Performance & Workshop\n11am\n12:30pm\n2:30pm\n4:30pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nMaking the Ephemeral\nHistories of Indian Perfume\nJames McHugh, Giti Datt & Ahalya Matthan\nDiscussion\n11:30am \u2013 1pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nKadahin Milandaasin |\n\u06aa\u068f\u0647\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0646\nA Jazz Quartet Weaving Memory into Music\nTarun Balani, Sonja Ott, Siddharth Gautam & Luke Marantz\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 8:30pm\n\n\nMar 1\nFuture Food Taste Test\nWhat\u2019s in Our Climate Pantry?\nEdible Issues\nWorkshop\n4pm \u2013 6pm\n\n\nMar 1\nAbhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam: The Circle of Love\nA K\u016b\u1e6diy\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dam Performance Where Love Blossoms\nNepathya\nPerformance\n7pm \u2013 9pm\n\n\n\nPresented by: \n \n",

    "description": "You know this story. \nA death in the royal family. A ghost with demands. A protagonist tipping toward madness, or something that looks like it. Revenge as the only logical conclusion. \nPut a woman in the centre. The axis shifts. \nDoes the ghost get believed? Does the grief get room, or a diagnosis? And what happens when the ghost doesn\u2019t ask for revenge at all, but tells her daughter to protect herself through education? \nPrincess Hamlet is twenty, home from college, fluent in manga and martial arts, and entirely unprepared for what her mother\u2019s ghost is asking of her. Adishakti\u2019s production departs sharply from Shakespeare, and in that departure, asks what we\u2019ve always taken for granted about grief, power, and who gets to act on either. \nWritten, adapted and directed by Vinay Kumar. Nimmy Raphel plays a Hamlet the original never imagined. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

    "description": "Romance. Bromance. Family. Faith. \nLove knows no bounds, and this reading session celebrates all its forms! \nThrough diverse voices and stories, we\u2019ll explore how love shows up in daily rituals, acts of courage, chosen family, and quiet moments of care. Bring your own experiences as we discover together the many ways love gives meaning to our lives. \nAtta Galata adds to the experience with a curated selection of quick reads by Indian authors, perfect for browsing or discovery. After the reading hour, the silence gently gives way to conversation; an easy exchange about the books that stayed with you, surprised you, or shaped your perspective on love. \nThere\u2019s something magical about a room full of people lost in their own worlds yet together in the same space. No pressure, no performance. Just pages, pauses, and the rare pleasure of reading in truly good company! \nThis event is part of our Programmes at the Library series at BIC. \nWe\u2019re reimagining the BIC Library as a warm, welcoming space for connection and exploration. Through thoughtfully curated sessions, we aim to engage the diverse interests and ages within our community. Our goal is to create an enriching environment for discovery, experimentation, and collaboration, beyond the books on our shelves! \nWe welcome your ideas and input. If you have ideas for events or activities that align with our vision, we\u2019d be delighted to hear from you.

    "description": "A dark body draped in yellow. Flower garland, peacock feather. You know the image. \nWhen Lord Krishna plays his flute, everything bends toward that sound. The cow freezes mid-graze, standing on one leg. The gopi stops mid-task. The lotus pauses mid-bloom. For centuries, Indian artists have followed that call. \nPichwai comes from Rajasthan\u2019s temple havelis, worship made visible on cloth. Kuchipudi from Andhra\u2019s villages, stories told through the body. Opposite ends of India, both Vaishnavite traditions holding the same images sacred. \nTogether on stage is an unlikely trio: Pichwai painter Shan Bhatnagar, Kuchipudi dancer Amrita Lahiri, flautist Hrishikesh Majumdar. Each devoted to their form, each form devoted to Krishna.\u00a0Bhatnagar walks you through his paintings between dance pieces. Lahiri responds, those frozen moments coming alive through movement. Majumdar\u2019s flute ties it together, the sound that makes devotion inevitable. \nNorth and South. Stillness and motion. The call and the answer. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year\u2019s festival is built around what we hear, smell, touch, taste, and see.

You may have heard some of them before. That is the point. Repetition does not preserve meaning, it changes it. The same notes, heard again, evoke different emotions. \nEach piece arrives with a scent. The music reaches you through the ear. The fragrance reaches you somewhere you can\u2019t quite name.

    "description": "Your brain is doing something incredible right now. \nJust by reading this, you\u2019re taking in information, making connections, and building a picture of the world, without even trying. But what if you could understand how that works? \nIn this workshop, we get into the science and philosophy behind learning itself. How do your senses shape what you believe? Why do two people experience the same moment completely differently? And what does that mean for how you see, and question, everything around you? \nThrough sharp discussion and some genuinely surprising ideas, you\u2019ll leave thinking about your own mind in a way you never have before. \n\nAround the World in 50 Sundays\u00a0is a journey that begins, not with a ticket, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \n\nSupported by:\n\n",

    "description": "Scent travels across time. You just don\u2019t think about it that way. \nA whiff of jasmine connects you to rituals performed two thousand years ago. Sandalwood routes that crossed continents. Rose attar distilled using techniques older than most written records.\u00a0Perfume holds ecology, trade, memory, and craft in a single drop. \nJames McHugh lectures on smell in early Indian religion and culture. How scent functioned in ritual. How aromatics were understood, classified, traded across ancient networks. Then, a conversation with Bengaluru-based perfumer Ahalya Matthan and anthropologist-perfumer Giti Datt. They work with traditional attars, the concentrated fragrances India has been making for centuries.

    "description": "\nOne diplomat. Four decades. An entire world in upheaval. \nFrom the dying days of the Soviet Union to the streets of Burma, from a kingdom being absorbed into India to the two Germanys becoming one, this memoir traces an extraordinary career lived at the fault lines of history. \nWritten by a former Indian diplomat, the book moves across the Soviet Union, Sikkim, Burma, South Korea, Germany, Ukraine and Indonesia, charting four decades of geopolitical transformation through the eyes of someone who was there. Not in the briefing rooms of power, but on the ground, watching, listening, and recording what ordinary people wanted for their lives: freedom, openness, dignity. \nRunning through it all is a quieter story, of India itself, navigating a turbulent world as a non-aligned nation, finding its footing politically and economically while the old order collapsed around it. \nThis is history as it was lived. Up close, and impossible to look away from. \n\n",

He travelled through India\u2019s football heartlands, from the hills of the northeast to the coasts of Kerala to the flatlands of Bengal, searching for the game beneath the game. He mapped our country through its football culture in his book,\u00a0Sacred Grounds: The Journey Through People\u2019s Football in India. \nIn this talk, Sandeep brings\u00a0those stories to life. The local heroes nobody outside their village has heard of. The formats (Sevens, Khep, Basti tournaments) that have their own rules, their own rituals, their own worlds. The communities for whom football isn\u2019t a sport so much as a language. \nThis is football as identity, as belonging, as something worth fighting to keep alive. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A.

    "description": "Have you ever heard a kudamuzha? The five-faced drum disappeared centuries ago. As did the yaazh harp, the urumi, the parai. Instruments that once shaped Tamil ritual soundscapes, gone silent. \nUrupaanar brought them back. \nTHOL\u00a0is their debut album, the world\u2019s first recorded entirely on the yaazh. It\u2019s also a live performance, a sonic excavation of Tamil antiquity where music becomes a site of memory and landscape. Drawing from Sangam-era traditions, the eight-piece collective uses reconstructed ancient instruments to create sound that is both archival and immediate. \nThe performance follows the thinai system from Tolk\u0101ppiyam, which understands emotion as inseparable from environment. Mountains, forests, farmlands, seashores, arid regions: each landscape gives rise to distinct emotional states and rhythms. Feeling is shaped by climate, terrain, flora, sound, movement. Music emerges from ecology, carrying the textures of place and the sensorial conditions of lived life. \nNinety minutes of ancient sonic ecosystems reactivated in contemporary performance. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

That moment of surrender? That\u2019s the real mountain. \nIn this multimedia talk based on their new book,\u00a0What\u2019s Your Everest? (Bloomsbury), Samir and Sauraj strip the heroism from the world\u2019s highest peak. Through expedition films, fireside conversation, and an open Q&A, they unpack the unglamorous truth behind the glory of the summit: frostbitten hands at 8,000 meters, relief work after tragedy, and the brutal discipline of trying again. This is about failure, leadership, ego, and the invisible mountains we all face: ambition, burnout, fear, and the gap between wanting something and the willingness to suffer for it. \nWhat\u2019s your Everest?

    "description": "Sound hits your eardrums. Percussion resonates through your entire body. \nPercussionist Rahul Vanamali starts there. He walks you through two instruments: the vibraphone and the snare drum. Their histories and techniques. Then works that have never been performed in India.\u00a0Pieces that pull sounds you didn\u2019t know these instruments could make. \nThen he hands you the sticks. \nYou\u2019ll feel how a whisper-touch on a drum head creates depth. How striking the same bar in different spots shifts the tone. Sound, yes. But also vibration traveling up your arms, the hum settling in your ribs. After that, the room plays together.

Rose attar takes you to a Nawab\u2019s palace you never visited. \nThis exhibition traces the histories of perfume in India through texts, paintings, records, and objects left behind. Map how scent entered cuisine, medicine, worship. Follow trade routes that carried oils and essences across continents. Discover who made perfume, how it was distilled, where labor and craft intersect with commerce and ritual. \nIn collaboration with MARG Magazine, the exhibition culminates in a conversation with James McHugh, Giti Datt, and Ahalya Matthan. \nImage and text.

    "description": "Nobody said the afterlife would be fair. \nTwo enemy soldiers die in battle and find themselves at the same border crossing into the afterlife. The officer in charge is a Postman Aunty with a pet goldfish and a makeshift post office that serves both sides of the conflict equally. As the soldiers navigate what comes next, letters from the war begin to surface. Masks shift, puppets move, bodies speak. \nDirector Yuki Ellias built a show without words, letting movement do the work. Sofiyum, a Sikkimese band, fills the stage with music that weaves Lepcha folk traditions into something entirely its own. The songs, created in Lepcha with the Dur See Brothers, give the show a sound world as specific and ethereal as its setting. \nCold mountains. A border cutting through no man\u2019s land. A goldfish. And somewhere in the middle of all of it, peace feels close, just like a spring morning. \nProduction Credits:\nStory, Direction, Actor: Yuki Ellias\nActor, Choreographer: Tapas Boro\nMusic and Sound: Sofiyum Band: Mickma Tshering Lepcha, Ongyal Tshering Lepcha, Noel J.

    "description": "26 minutes | Hindi with English subtitles | India | 2024 \nStarring: Konkona Sen Sharma & Ayan Khan\nScreenplay: Varun Grover \nInnocence is not a lack of intelligence. \nChildren often see clearly what adults choose to ignore. \nSupriyo is an 11-year-old boy with poor vision navigating 1992 India: a time of rising sociopolitical tensions.

    "description": "Bangalore smells. \nJasmine at dawn, petrol in traffic, filter coffee and wet earth after the first rain, incense curling through temple courtyards, garbage fermenting in afternoon heat. We live inside this rich olfactory landscape, but rarely pause to notice it. \nIndu Antony, however, has been mapping it for years. \nIn this 90-minute lecture-demonstration, Antony presents findings from V\u0101san\u00e9, Bangalore\u2019s first smell archive. Part urban anthropology, part sensory memoir, the work traces how scent carries memory, class, labour, and belonging in ways the visual record cannot. Smell resists documentation. It\u2019s intimate, fleeting, impossible to photograph. Which makes it a different kind of archive entirely. \nAntony walks you through her practice of mapping the city with her nose. The streets, markets, lakes, and corners where Bangalore announces itself before you see it. How smell marks territory, signals change, and holds what we\u2019ve lost. The lecture weaves fieldwork, personal narrative, and reflection on what it means to archive something so fugitive. \nThe session closes with a guided encounter: select scent-notes from the city, experienced in silence. An invitation to notice how your body remembers place beyond images and language. \nPart of Prav\u0101ha 2026, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year\u2019s festival is built around what we hear, smell, touch, taste, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music, contemporary dance, installations, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n",
