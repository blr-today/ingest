    "description": "A tool is only as good as the hands that wield it. \nAnd AI is, after all, another tool. \nThis talk explores how Artificial Intelligence functions as a collaborator for creativity: accelerating exploration, provoking new directions, and sharpening creative judgment. The session opens with live demonstrations that surface instinctive reactions to AI-generated content, then lifts the veil on how these systems actually work and why their outputs can feel genuinely creative. No jargon, just clarity on what\u2019s happening under the hood and why it\u2019s more interesting than you might expect. \nA live co-creation segment puts theory into practice. Using tools like ChatGPT, Suno, and Midjourney, the session demonstrates real creative workflows in action. You\u2019ll discover that the power lives in iteration, selection, and rejection, revealing how human judgment shapes everything that emerges from these systems. \nAI represents the next generation of creative tools, shifting how creation happens, not why it happens. Intent remains yours. Taste remains yours. Meaning remains yours. The talk concludes by exploring the questions that make this moment genuinely intriguing: authorship, originality, bias, ethics. As AI makes output abundant and accessible, your context, lived experience, and values determine what\u2019s worth making in the first place. \n",

    "description": "A new dawn was breaking. And its light would reach far beyond its time. \nRebellion in Verse\u00a0unfolds a journey that goes back to the sixth century CE; a time when many yearned for a reprieve from the constraints of Vedic orthodoxy and caste hierarchies. The Tamil Bhakti movement emerged as their clarion call, a grassroots surge of devotion that redefined spirituality and the social fabric itself. The saints of this movement were poets of the people, composing their hymns in Tamil and their verses, brimming with simplicity and profundity, wrestled divine wisdom from the elite grip of Sanskrit and handed it to the masses. \nThis conversation around\u00a0Raghavan Srinivasan\u2019s book Rebellion in Verse, explores how poetry has long served as a space of defiance: challenging hierarchy, authority, and inherited social orders. Drawing from Bhakti and other traditions, the discussion reflects on how verse carried ideas of equality, desire, and resistance, and why these voices continue to matter today. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

From the earth beneath us, from the quiet wisdom within, from the stillness we once knew. \nCommissioned by Kalavaahini Trust on the occasion of their 10th Anniversary, Viyoga is a dance performance that moves through the fractures of our time. \nBuilt on the premise of loss, it explores how our harmony with nature quietly fades, how the narcissistic self eclipses the deeper truth within, and how unbridled material desires overshadow the spiritual depth that sustains us. \nThrough movement and silence, Viyoga asks us to pause, witness, and rediscover what binds us. \nProduction Credits: \nConcept, Choreography & Lead: Vaibhav Arekar\nCreative Consultant: Malavika Sarukkas\nMusic Composition & Vocal: Karthik Hebbar\nLights & Costumes: Sushant Jadhav\nArtistic Director: Sushant Jadhav\nPercussion Design: Satish Krishnamurthy\nEnsemble: Eesha Pinglay, Swarada Bhave, Poorva Saraswat, Gautam Marathe, Anu Christi Pillai\nOrchestra: Madhuri Seshadri (Vocal), Suma Rani (Sitar), Shrinidhi Mattur (Violin), Shubha (Veena), Vivek Krishna (Flute), Venu (Keyboard)\nRecording: Omkar Studio, Bangalore (Shrinidhi Omkar)\nPoets: Kabir, Sharad Chandra, Sant Tukaram, Annamacharya, Da.

    "description": "Reconsider what it means to be whole. \nIn the Japanese art of Kintsugi, fracture lines become illumination. Damage transforms into something worth keeping. \nRed House brings this meditative practice to Bangalore after reaching over 20,000 participants across India. Their space in Okhla is itself a product of this philosophy: once an abandoned factory, it was converted into a thriving cultural hub in 2022. Now one of Delhi\u2019s pioneering hubs for this ancient art, Red House invites you to experience the ritual firsthand. \nThe process is simple but deliberate. Select a ceramic piece, break it with intention using a hammer, then carefully mend it, watching as golden seams emerge where cracks once lived. Traditional Kintsugi uses lacquer and gold powder in a painstaking, multi-step technique that can take weeks. This workshop offers a more accessible approach, allowing you to complete the full arc of breaking and repair in a single session. You\u2019ll leave with a vessel wearing its history openly, a reminder that our fractures, when tended to, can become the most beautiful part of us. \nAn act of creation that insists our faults and repairs are worth displaying. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n",

    "description": "This recital presents J.S. Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations, BWV 988, performed by pianist Eun Seong Hong. \nThe Goldberg Variations are thirty variations framed by an opening and closing aria, all built on a single, unchanging bass line. Across thirty-two movements, one musical idea unfolds into a hidden architecture in time, at once rigorous and deeply expressive. For the performer, navigating this structure is not only a technical challenge but an inward journey, where each note must carry both order and feeling. \nEun Seong Hong\u2019s first performance of the Goldberg Variations in India, this evening is an invitation to hear how Bach transforms a single idea into a small universe built with astonishing perfection. \n\u00a0 \nImage Credit \nThumbnail and Poster: Johann Sebastian Bach (aged 61) in a portrait by Elias Gottlob Haussmann (1695-1774), the second version of his 1746 canvas, bequeathed to Bach-Archiv Leipzig by William H Scheide (Princeton, New Jersey).

They will examine how scam economies thrive in the gaps of inequality, why trust is collapsing faster than we can rebuild it, and what it means when fraud becomes a viable career path for an entire generation.

The rules keep shifting, and the audience is never quite sure who is in control. \nThrough dance and puppetry, LONO offers a reflection on the stories we tell ourselves about who we are.

    "description": "Drawing from Commedia dell\u2019arte, clowning, and physical theatre, this workshop puts the body first. It explores how physical action, form, and rhythm can unlock imagination, presence, and emotional life in ways that psychological approaches alone cannot. \nDeveloped in collaboration with La Compagnie Dramatique, whose long-running, critically acclaimed comedy\u00a0by Dario Fo,\u00a0The Open Couple, has been in repertoire since 2013, this workshop offers an inside look at the playful, high-energy physical tools used in making a full-scale professional production, and how they are shaped into clear, dynamic storytelling. \nWho It\u2019s For \nFor actors and theatre practitioners, this workshop loosens habitual patterns, rebuilds physical ease, and rediscovers play. It is particularly useful if you feel blocked, overly cerebral, or curious about comedy and physical performance. \nFor writers, directors, educators, or anyone curious about how performers work, the principles here extend well beyond the stage. Presence, adaptability, attention, and expressive freedom are skills that land anywhere. \nCuriosity, openness, and a willingness to play are enough. \nInside the Workshop \n\nDiscover the impact of exaggeration, contrast and neutrality\u00a0\nWitness the relationship between physical form and inner state\nExperience mindful presence, unburdened play, and the pleasure of being seen\nLearn to make an audience lean in with physical storytelling, rhythm, and clarity\nLearn how these tools are ultimately shaped in service of text and performance\n\nParticipants will engage with the kinds of physical, rhythmic, and embodied approaches that are used in the making of a full-scale professional production. The workshop offers an inside look at how playful, high-energy physical exploration is later shaped, refined, and structured into clear storytelling and performance craft. The workshop is designed not for mastery in a single session, but for opening doors: to imagination, confidence, and a deeper appreciation of theatrical craft. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n",

    "description": "A single family. A small village. An entire nation\u2019s story hiding inside. \nTell Me A Story About Our World brings together academic and translator Vanamala Viswanatha and novelist Kavery Nambisan for a conversation about the art of fiction and storytelling, based on Nambisan\u2019s latest novel, Rising Sons. Set in a village in Karnataka, following one family from pre-independent India through to the 1970s, threading through the complexities of caste and colonialism while painting vivid landscapes of rural and urban life in a bygone era. \nWhat makes Rising Sons sing is how Nambisan inhabits her world. Kannada coexists comfortably within the English, not as a novelty but as a force of realism, enabling the reader\u2019s sensibility to percolate through society at every level. Then there is the narrator: never formally introduced, yet unmistakably present, speaking of \u201cour village\u201d and \u201cour daily lives\u201d with a voice that is not quite impartial. The resulting text reads as both narration and remembrance, an immersion into a carefully crafted world. \nThe stories we tell are as much about the Word as they are about the World. Expect an interesting and illuminating conversation, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n",

    "description": "42 minutes |\u00a0\u00a0English & Hindi with English subtitles | India |\u00a02025 \nCompassion. Conflict. Culling. Care. \nMenace\u00a0is a documentary that examines one of the most contested questions in contemporary Indian cities: how do we coexist with stray dogs? Set against recent judicial directions and everyday urban realities, the film moves beyond polarised debates to explore the moral, legal, and governance dimensions of the issue. Through voices from animal welfare practitioners, veterinarians, lawyers, municipal actors, adopters, and citizens, Menace\u00a0traces the shift from historical practices of dog culling to the Animal Birth Control (ABC) framework, while questioning why humane policies often fail in implementation. \nThe screening will be followed by a moderated conversation bringing together perspectives from law, animal welfare, and civic practice. This programme invites audiences to engage with complexity, contradiction, and ethical choice: opening space for reflection on how cities negotiate care and safety without resorting to cruelty or neglect. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n",

    "description": "21 minutes | Kashmiri and Hindi with English subtitles | 2024 | India \nWhen grief becomes obsession. \nAfter losing her husband under mysterious circumstances, Farah clings to his memory through the saplings he brought to their kitchen garden. But when rats threaten the fragile plants, and a land buyer threatens her home, Farah\u2019s devotion spirals into dangerous obsession. \nIt is shot during Kashmir\u2019s bleakest season, deliberately stripping away the region\u2019s famous beauty to focus on something rarely seen in Indian cinema: the inner life of a Kashmiri woman, not the postcard landscape around her. \nFollowing the screening will be a discussion with the Film Director,\u00a0Rayit Hashmat Qazi and\u00a0Research Analyst,\u00a0Aishwaria Sonavane.
