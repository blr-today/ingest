    "description": "Main Tawaif is a presentation by Manjari Chaturvedi,\u00a0under\u00a0The Courtesan Project\u00a0Series. 15\u00a0years in existence, the series is founded and conceptualised by\u00a0Classical Dancer, Creator of Sufi Kathak, and Restorer of the Dance of Tawaifs,\u00a0Manjari Chaturvedi. The Courtesan Project\u00a0has become one of the most successful dance revival movements in today\u2019s time. Giving a voice to the women and 100s of years of creative contribution to theatre, cinema and performing arts. \nThis performance is an exploration of the gender dynamics within the arts, unveiling the pivotal influence of women performers \u2013 the enigmatic Tawaifs and Baijis \u2013 of North India from the 16th to the 20th century. The performance is set as an intimate mehfil performance of how the Tawaifs would perform in yesteryears. Their music, their stories, their dance enacted by a single performer. \nThis is a bold statement that is needed to finally accord respect for the performance art of the Tawaif, to go beyond the drawing room sniggers and laughter associated with the word Tawaif, and to finally acknowledge their role in history. \nSupported by: \n \n",

    "description": "2022 | 99 mins | Kashmiri, Urdu with English Subtitles | India/France/Qatar \nIn the last three decades, approximately eight to ten thousand cases of enforced disappearances have occurred in Kashmir. Mostly young men picked up by the Indian security forces, never to return home. Until now, more than six thousand unmarked graves have been discovered in Kashmir. The relatives of the disappeared persons believe that their loved ones may be buried in these graves, but the State refuses to conduct DNA tests to identify the bodies. \nIn the city of Srinagar, Nargis searches for her missing husband, Manzoor, until she is forced to hopelessly return to her village home. With a little help from a local man Yaseen, she silently toils away on an exquisite weave. But the quiet of the Kashmiri winter is like the silence of the graveyard, waiting to be shredded by what lies buried within. \nMaagh\u00a0(The Winter Within) is a tragic tale of Kashmiris\u2019 struggle for self-determination, and freedom from state oppression. An oppression, ripping apart the social fabric, under which, it is Nargis, a woman, who shows greater commitment to the ideas of justice and freedom. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with Director, Aamir Bashir and Film Educator, Basav Biradar. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Kannada | 70 mins | Suitable for all ages \nHow many Ramayanas? A hundred, two hundred, three hundred and so on. A.K. Ramanujan, a multilingual scholar, wrote an essay \u201cThree Hundred Ramayanas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation\u201d which scholarly narrates the existence of many Ramayanas in India and in South Asian countries. This play could be one amongst them, and this production is inspired by this essay. \nThroughout the Valmiki Ramayana, Sri Rama occupies the central stage as the main character. Many folk versions of Ramayanas (Chitrapata Ramayana, Ravana Chaya etc.) narrate the story of Sita. She occupies the centre stage. In Adbhuta Ramayana, Sita is the protagonist. She is not only a manifestation of Goddess Lakshmi but also the first force of creation known as Prakruti (Nature). Sita is the focus of the story rather than Rama, and it seeks to establish the greatness, courage, valour, strength, power, and potential of Womanhood which are traditionally so cherished. Sri Rama fails to subdue and vanquish Shatakhanta Ravana, who was ten times more powerful than his younger sibling Dashakhanta Ravana. Sita defeats this great demon and restores peace on earth by eliminating the courage of all evil-mongering demons representing vices and perversions. \nBased on Kandagal Hanamanta Rao\u2019s Company Drama\u00a0\nDirected by Rajani Garud\nAdapted for Puppetry by Prakash Garud\nMusic by\u00a0Raghava Kammar\nProduced by Gombe Mane (Puppet House), Dharwad \nAbout Gombe Mane/Puppet House: \n \nPuppet House is a practicing centre for both theatre and puppetry.

    "description": "Dark energy is the leading candidate for the mechanism that is responsible for causing the cosmological expansion to accelerate. Bharat Ratra will describe the astronomical data which persuade cosmologists that (as yet undetected) dark energy and dark matter are by far the main components of the energy budget of the universe at the present time. He will review how these observations have led to the development of a quantitative \u201cstandard\u201d model of cosmology that describes the evolution of the universe from an early epoch of inflation to the complex hierarchy of structure seen today. In this non-technical talk, he will also discuss the basic physics, and the history of ideas, on which this model is based. \nThis lecture is a part of RRI\u2019s Vignyana Kathegalu, a series of popular talks on science. \nIn collaboration with\u00a0Raman Research Institute, Bangalore. \n \n",

    "description": "On the surface, an Indian doctor, a\u00a0British poet, an UberEats courier in Pittsburgh, and a Chinese activist in exile have nothing in common. But they are in fact linked by a profound common experience\u2015unexpected encounters with artificial intelligence. In\u00a0her debut book\u00a0Code Dependent, shortlisted for the inaugural Women\u2019s Prize for Non-fiction 2024, Madhumita Murgia shows how automated systems are reshaping our lives all over the world, from technology that marks children as future criminals, to an app that is helping to\u00a0offer medical\u00a0diagnoses to a remote tribal community. \nBy highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley, Madhumita explores the impact of this often-exploitative technology on individuals, communities, and our wider society. \nVidushi Marda, a lawyer and researcher, specialises in examining the socio-legal ramifications of data-driven technologies. Her research centers on technology regulation, asymmetric power dynamics, and fundamental rights. Through her endeavors, she collaborates with governments, corporations, and technical communities to promote social justice. \nTogether, they will discuss and unpack how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency, and shatter our illusion of free will. AI has already infiltrated our day-to-day, through language-generating chatbots like ChatGPT and social media. But it\u2019s also affecting us in more insidious ways. It touches everything from our interpersonal relationships, to our kids\u2019 education, work, finances, public services, and even our human rights. It is already changing what it means to be human, in ways large and small, and Madhumita and Vidushi reveal what could happen if we fail to reclaim our humanity. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks, Author \u2013 Madhumita Murgia is in conversation with the Lawyer and Researcher \u2013 Vidushi Marda. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in May 2024. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!

The plot unfolds through a mix of comedy and drama, revealing the guru\u2019s insincerity. The guru takes advantage of the wealthy man`s unquestioning admiration. As the family plots a smart plan, the audience is invited to watch the unfolding events, wondering if the imposter will be caught. The main theme humorously explores the dishonesty in religious behavior, the risks of trusting the wrong people, and the outcomes of blindly following someone, all presented in a satirical manner. The play aims to entertain while shedding light on the dangers of blindly trusting those who manipulate religious appearances for personal gain. Through its mix of comedy and drama, \u2018Natydevacharite\u2019 unfolds a tale that prompts the audience to reflect on the consequences of misplaced trust and the humorous aspects of religious hypocrisy. \nAbout the Team \nSanchaya is a theatre group which has made a name for itself in the art and culture circles of Bangalore. Established in 1988, Sanchaya was the dream child of G. S. Rama Rao, a teacher at MES High School, Jayanagar, Bangalore. Fondly called GSR by Sanchayans, he envisioned the role of art and culture in moulding human personalities, and brought together his students to form a troupe. Aptly named Sanchaya (meaning \u201cComing together of\u201d), it was intended to be a melting pot of drama, literature, and creativity. The team started out by putting together plays by the then students and now, founding members. The very first play \u201cVallabhapuriya Dantakathe\u201d set the beginning for the wonderful journey that is in its 33rd year now. Many plays followed and with it, the transformation of the troupe from a student-centered group to a professionally managed popular theatre team. Today we have a repertoire of more than 40 plays. Along the way, we have had gratifying achievements that make us proud. We have reached theatre lovers across many cities in India. We have performed at \u201cBharat Rang Mahotsav\u201d hosted by National School of Drama, New Delhi. The play \u201cPratibimbagalu\u201d garnered wide critical acclaim for the multi-dimensional portrayal of a classic play. We have also organized many Theatre Festivals to provide a platform for young amateur teams to showcase their plays. With the vision of bringing all the theatre teams of Bangalore together, we organized a flagship event called \u201cRanga-Ugadi\u201d. We call these endeavors \u201cEnriching Theatre Brotherhood\u201d. Not restricting our vista to plays alone, we have been organizing musical events as well. Sanchaya\u2019s directorial repertoire includes prominent theatre artists like C.G. Krishnamurthy, R. Nagesh, S. Surendranath, Suresh Anagalli, Krishnamurthy Kavathar, S. K. Madhava Rao, Abbur Jayatheertha, Kathlu Satya, Iqbal Ahmed, Joseph John, Shashidhar Barighat, among others. It has groomed many artists who have become famous film and TV actors, producers, and directors today. We are also very proud of having enticed a whole new generation of youngsters towards theatre, keeping with the true spirit of GSR. Our theatre family, as we like to call it, has grown to include more than 200 members. \n\u0cac\u0cc6\u0c82\u0c97\u0cb3\u0cc2\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0ca8 \u0c95\u0cb2\u0cbe

The central idea of this photo-series is that during migration of people across geographies, the objects of love and necessity undergo the arduous ordeal, and that these, bearing the patina of age, create a desire to develop an understanding that personal histories are not isolated from the political selves. \nThe technique of cyanotypes, which is used to print the archival maps for\u00a0A Home in the Constant Flux: A Call to the Verb Memory\u00a0metamorphoses into a metaphor of capriciousness \u2013 endured by refugees. As the cartographic lines, in various shades of blue and white, overlap the digital images of the objects, they gesture at the fluidity of the memory only to find itself resistant to the burden of confinement around the refugees. The aesthetic of distortion \u2013 in the form of borders, the viscosity of the blues and whites, and the ballet of letters \u2013 epitomises the inevitability of embracing impermanence as one of the few constants in a life on the move. The element of distortion serves as a bridge between abstract and representation to encourage the viewer to navigate and map the photo series in order to question the boundaries of perception. \nThe panel discussion on the second day of the event will\u00a0delve into the influence of visual representation on refugee narratives, particularly in light of the surge of imagery overpowering the social and print media in recent years. This influx frequently drowns out the individual voices of refugees, maintaining stereotypical visual stereotypes that confine visual language of that of a destitute \u2018other\u2019. Furthermore, the conversation will confront the inherent tendency to marginalize migrants through photography, highlighting the disparity between mainstream portrayals and the more empathetic and authentic depictions found in the research-based project A Home in the Constant Flux: A Call to the Verb Memory. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n\u00a0 \n",

In due course, these new technologies made long-distance travel and communication widely accessible and affordable. In a parallel development, the introduction of limited representation in legislatures in the 1890s added urgency to tap the potential trans-local identities enumerated in the decennial censuses beginning in 1871-72. \nIn view of these developments, local communities, in particular, castes, tapped new technologies to connect with kindred groups across the country and combine to form pan-Indian communities. Post offices allowed members of these aggregate groupings to correspond with each other, while railways enabled them to meet periodically and devise strategies to capture a share in legislatures, educational institutions and public employment proportionate to their census population. Drawing upon philatelic material covering a century, the exhibition highlights the role of the postal system in this new politics. \nThe exhibition is divided into two broad parts that bring together correspondence and publications of several caste-based community organisations and individuals from across the country and the philatelic output of the post-colonial state.\u00a0The exhibition has been curated by Vikas Kumar, who teaches economics at Azim Premji University. \nProf Gopal Guru will inaugurate the exhibition and deliver the inaugural address on May 31, 6:45 pm. He will comment on the exhibition and locate its images in the larger politics of visual culture. \nA Panel Discussion with\u00a0Prof. Satish Deshpande, a distinguished social scientist who has made seminal contributions to our understanding of caste in independent India, Vaishna Roy,\u00a0Editor-in-Chief, Frontline magazine and Vikas Kumar, Curator of the exhibit, will take place on 2 June, 11:30 am. \nIn collaboration with\u00a0Azim Premji University, Bangalore \n \n",

    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations, the wealth-worth billions in today\u2019s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change \u2013 the emotional and the rational \u2013 and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change\u2014something prevalent in today\u2019s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away.\u00a0The authors will share their insight\u00a0on how it\u2019s imperative to draw lessons from the past, navigate the present, and prepare for the future. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

    "description": "Hindi, Bundelkhandi, Brajawali, Awadhi | 75 Mins | Suitable for Ages 16+ \nSakal Jaani he Naath is a comedy folk musical adapted from Vasant Deo\u2019s Sudama ke Chawal. It revisits the famed mythological fable about Lord Krishna and his childhood friend Sudama. A Tragic-Comedy that explores the narrative of the contemporary human situation and is a satire on today\u2019s man, his double standards and polluted mind. While the story and characters are the same, the ethos of these characters is what is seen today and in common life. The age-old tale and its characters have been used only as a reference. \nThe play runs parallel with Narottam Das\u2019s Sudamacharit and their verses are sung in folk tunes of Doha and Behre Tavil. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Her first gramophone recording, Ayyo Koyyoda at age 8, ignited her lifelong love affair with folk music. She was a trailblazer who introduced folk songs on a concert platform when she was 11. Encouraged by the overwhelming response she started giving full length folk concerts along with her sister, Vinjamuri Seetha Devi. Popularly known as the Vinjamuri Sisters, they became a phenomenon that took the music world by storm.\u00a0 \nAnasuya started composing music for her uncle,\u00a0Devulapalli Krishna Sastri when she was 9 and became a sought-after music composer. She was multi-talented and excelled in music of every genre but folk music remained her passion. She dedicated her life to popularising and propagating traditional and folk songs. She bequeathed an invaluable legacy to posterity by categorising her vast collection into 7 volumes and publishing them along with lyrics and music notations. At the age of 80, Anasuya became a writer and published 4 books including her autobiography Asamana Anasuya, at the age of 94.\u00a0 \nThe film screening will be followed by a discussion with Devina Dutt and a Q&A with the audience. \n",
