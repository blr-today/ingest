    "description": "We inherit more than genes at birth; we inherit environments. \nThis panel turns the spotlight on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD), a growing body of science showing how conditions in the womb and early childhood shape lifelong risk for diabetes, heart disease, and other noncommunicable diseases. As India confronts a deepening NCD crisis, the deeper question this conversation raises is unsettling and urgent: if risk begins before birth, how do we protect a future we cannot yet see?\u00a0 \nThe session will examine why early nutrition, air pollution, toxic exposures, and social environments matter as much as adult lifestyle. Dr Kalpana Balakrishnan will discuss how air and toxic exposures affect health beyond the lungs, while Dr Naveen Ramesh will address how nutrition, social systems, and public health responses come into play. The discussion will be moderated by Dr Ashok Vellodi. \nThis panel discussion invites a rethinking of public health itself, from treatment to prevention, from adulthood to the very start of life.\u00a0A Q&A with the audience will close the session. \n",

    "description": "How does ideology become actionable?\u00a0 \nIn the padippakkam (reading rooms) of Tamil Nadu, ideas spread like wildfire. Pamphlets passed from hand to hand and conversations stretched endlessly. What began as intellectual restlessness soon crystallised into a shared civic consciousness.\u00a0 \nThe Dravidian Pathway traces how this cultural churning transformed into one of India\u2019s most enduring political movements. Vignesh Rajahmani\u2019s study illuminates the Dravidian movement\u2019s sophisticated synthesis of anti-caste thought, aspirations for socio-economic mobility, and an inclusive Dravidian\u2013Tamil identity; an evolution that culminated in the emergence of the electorally formidable DMK. In his account, ideology is never abstract: it is lived, negotiated, and embodied by ordinary people seeking dignity and opportunity. \nIn this discussion, Rajahmani is joined by Dr. Srikrishna Ayyangar and Dr. Atreyee Majumder, to examine the strategies of Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, K. Kamaraj, C.N. Annadurai, and M. Karunanidhi, and consider how their ideas continue to shape Tamil Nadu\u2019s political imagination in an age of rising majoritarianism. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n",

Ananthamurthy\u2019s Samskara, he connects these ancient debates to contemporary questions of responsibility, community, and moral action.\u00a0With clarity and depth, Smith examines how ideas of dharma and adharma operate in the Sanskrit Mahabharata and how these ideas ripple outward into contemporary India.\u00a0 \nA Q&A with the audience will follow, offering space for reflection and dialogue. \nIn collaboration with: \n  \n",

With uncanny consistency, FTII produced top talent: Jaya Bachchan and Shabana Azmi, Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Subhash Ghai, Shatrughan Sinha, Girish Kasaravalli, Mani Kaul, and many other cinema legends. His alumni became the big names of Bollywood, spearheaded the Indian New Wave, kickstarted regional language cinema, and helped usher television into the country. \nIt\u2019s this extraordinary creative legacy that leads to the book\u2019s tantalizing question: Did Jagat Murari have a secret formula? In conversation with author Radha Chadha, Ambassador Talmiz Ahmad, legendary filmmaker Girish Kasaravalli, and iconic cinematographer G.S. Bhaskar, this session will delve into how Jagat Murari and FTII shaped generations of filmmakers \u2013 and how their work transformed Indian cinema into the global powerhouse it is today. Both Radha and Talmiz grew up at FTII, where their fathers served as Principal and Vice Principal. \nThe session will include a montage of student film clips of iconic FTII alumni Jaya Bachchan, Shabana Azmi, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Subhash Ghai, Mani Kaul, and others, as also an excerpt from Girish Kasaravalli\u2019s award-winning student film Avsesh. A Q&A with the audience will be followed by book signings by the author. \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations, arts, and culture directly to diverse audiences. Through this initiative, we collaborate with various venues, extending the reach of our events beyond our own space.

    "description": "Contrast becomes a catalyst for choreography in conversation! \nThis edition of Dual Margam brings together the leaping dynamism of Kuchipudi and the sensuous symmetry of Odissi, inviting audiences into a rare encounter between movement vocabularies. Kuchipudi enters with its theatrical lineage of swift footwork, buoyant jumps, and a dramatic pulse inherited from dance-drama traditions. Odissi counters with sculptural grace, curved lines, and a musicality that shimmers through every shift of the torso. \nSide by side, they reveal how classical technique carries the soul of a region; how mythology is interpreted through rhythm, how stories are shaped by cultural memory, and how two forms can diverge in grammar yet still speak to the same emotional truth. \nAn evening that showcases the extraordinary breadth of Indian performance traditions on a single stage. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam), while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by: \n \n",

Beneath Ananya\u2019s soft-spoken, inward presence lies a lyricism that is unflinchingly honest, tracing how her relationship with herself has evolved over time. \nBuilt with contributions from over forty friends and collaborators across the world, A Junkyard Wonder unfolds as both collective creation and private reckoning.

    "description": "72 minutes | French with English subtitles | France | 2021 \nWriter & Director: C\u00e9line Sciamma\nStarring: Jos\u00e9phine Sanz, Gabrielle Sanz, Nina Meurisse, St\u00e9phane Varupenne\nComposer: Jean-Baptiste de Laubier \nA new way of seeing our mothers, our daughters, and ourselves. \nAfter eight-year-old Nelly loses her grandmother, she travels with her parents to the family home where memories linger like breath on glass. Wandering into the woods, she meets a girl her own age, Marion, whose face mirrors her own mother\u2019s childhood photographs. What unfolds is a quietly radical conversation across time, told through the strange clarity of childhood compassion. \nDissolving the boundaries between generations, the film creates space for a mother\u2013daughter relationship to be understood from the purest vantage: that of two children. Sciamma crafts a world where magic feels utterly natural, where grief can be shared, and where imagination becomes a tool for consolation.\u00a0 \nIn just 72 tender minutes, Petite Maman asks how we inherit sorrow, and how we might finally lay it down. \nThis is the fourth film in our collaboration with MUBI. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience! \nIn collaboration with: \n \n \n",
