    "description": "42 minutes, 04 seconds |\u00a0Nepali, English & Lepcha | English Subtitles \n\u201cBefore the formation of this holy Rongnue (Teesta) from the bottom of Kongchen (Khanchendzonga), \nWe used to narrate the parentage of River Rongnue, \nWater of the river Teesta we use to offer during the ritual, \nIf this water dries up, there will be a drought, \nRongnue is a holy water, it is a god of water\u2026 Achulay, we narrate as a song, \nAchulay \nRongnue is the god of water\u2026\u201d \nWith hydro energy being one of the convenient and available energy source for the development of any given State, the film tries to understand the relationship between various groups and communities of Sikkim and West Bengal with River Teesta. This film tries to trace the faint and unheard voices of local people who are affected by these developments. It travels from the source of River Teesta till the tip of the plains of North Bengal, traverses through mini and mega hydel projects to capture these naked voices and their bond, angst, adaptation and reconciliation with River Teesta. \nThe story particularly revolves around the unique practice and beliefs of mountain communities and they express their significance of the river through their folklore, sacred ritual and scriptures. Communities from downstream struggle to balance their faith and religion with such developments and others confess the helpless need of sustaining and adapting to the changing economic patterns and surmounting unemployment. The film eventually ends with a question if Teesta will ever speak for herself. \nThe film screening will be followed by a discussion and Q&A with the audience. \nCredits:\nDirector: Minket Lepcha\nEditor: Wangyal Sherpa & Salil Mukhia\nCinematographer: Anup Aadin Das\nSound: Hishey Bhutia\nResearch: Kachyo Lepcha & Minket Lepcha \n",

    "description": "Food holds the power to nourish and sustain us, to delight and transport us. A good meal can collapse the distance between my past and my present, ferry me to faraway family, or bring me closer to my inner child. For writers, food is an especially potent means to delve into memory, notions of home, heritage, and relationships. \nIn this workshop, open to writers in all genres, we will consider the plate as a portal, reaching through sensorium and memory to explore what food can offer to our practice. We will read prose and poetry about food together and discuss the role that food plays as a cultural signifier, as a love language in the domestic space, as a carrier for history, and more. \nThrough guided generative work, participants will be invited to consider the food that has nourished them in its fullness \u2013 where it comes from, what historical and personal narratives it holds, what language it allows them to access, how it might have changed over time. We\u2019ll read, write, and share, working together to discover the ways in which the theme of food can nourish our writing. \nWhile the workshop will be conducted in English, and we\u2019ll be reading primarily English-language texts, writers are welcome to make use of any language(s) they wish to. \n",

Do you crave connection, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends\u2026 Yet, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together, drifting apart, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise\u2026 \nThis is an adaptation of \u201cBh\u016bmikampa \u2013 Das Erdbeben\u201d which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n\u201cMira and Sameer find themselves surrounded by unspoken words. \u2018The Earthquake\u2019 delves into the essence of human relationships\u2014our connections, routines, distances, and all the spaces in between.

Antagonistic relationships create space for a gray place, the place that inhabits what is not yet one thing or the other. This is not a solo aims to research and deepen issues related to identity, the exposure of the self, the importance we attribute to the set of qualities and particularities that we think define us, the place of confrontation with the vision of the another, the dizzying sensation of detaching ourselves from what is known and comfortable to reveal inner layers that remain inaccessible to others.\n \nEgo | Echo |\u00a015 min |\u00a0Indrek Kornel\nA dialogue between self and surroundings, Ego | Echo explores the interplay of reflection an resonance. Hyper-aware of the textures, sounds, tastes, and rhythms of the here and now, the performer navigates the constant feedback loop between their body and the world around them. How does the echo of their presence alter the ego of their being? In this improvised journey, they let each moment reshape them\u2014a push and pull between intention and instinct, order and chaos, heaven and hell. It is a movement through the shifting landscapes of self and space, where the only constant is the present. \nFloating Clouds |\u00a015 min |\u00a0Abhilash Ningappa\nFloating Clouds is a contemplative performance that examines the complexities of life through the lens of artistic expression. It reflects on the universal challenges, aspirations, and fleeting triumphs that shape the human experience The piece combines expressive dance, spoken word, and symbolic gestures to create a rich tapestry of movement and meaning. The choreography, marked by fluidity and grace, evokes the transient beauty of clouds, offering a metaphor for the impermanence of life. Spoken text serves as a bridge, drawing the audience into the narrative and fostering a shared space of reflection. Through its interplay of movement and language. Floating Clouds invites audiences to engage with themes of transformation, resilience, and the ephemeral nature of existence.\n \nSupported by:\n \n",

    "description": "Of all regions of India, the Deccan has the most diverse architectural traditions, nowhere better shown than in the variety of stone temples sponsored under a succession of dynasties which ruled peninsular India over some 700 years. To illustrate this unique diversity, Michell explores religious monuments at lesser-known sites. He begins with Early Chalukya temples overlooking the Tungabhadra river at Alampur, and ends with the imposing Kakatiya monument at the out of the way village of Palampet, both in Telangana. In between, he discusses the Nolamaba period shrines at Nandi and Shravana Belgola, and those of the Later Chalukyas at Sudi, Kuruvatti and Lakkundi, all in Karnataka. He concludes with the little visited Hoysala period shrines at Belavadi, Mosale and Agraha Bachhahalli. \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A Session with the audience. \nImage credit \u2013 Surendra Kumar \nIn collaboration with:\n\u00a0 \n",
