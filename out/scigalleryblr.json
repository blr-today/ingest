Inspired by artist Jade Armstrong\u2019s original concept, this workshop explores the delicate balance between beauty, sweetness, and the fleeting nature of life.\n\nIn this workshop, Chef Pratyay will guide the participants to learn and to create intricate sugar-blown sculptures, each capturing a single breath and symbolising both the passage of time and the fragility of life. As these sculptures slowly melt into syrupy residue, they reflect sugar\u2019s transformation from a prized luxury to an overconsumed treat.\n\nThis hands-on experience encourages reflection on desire, decay, and consumption.",

Yet, this raises crucial questions: who is implicated in these changes, and who bears responsibility? From the climate impacts of monocultures to global patterns of labour exploitation, the CALORIE exhibition-season explores complex questions around planetary health and human activity. \n\nLed by our Experimentors Ayati and Vinaya, we invite you to a walkthrough of CALORIE to critically engage with what the Anthropocene means and the challenges it poses to planetary health.

    "description": "Ever wonder what predatory birds feed on? \n\nJoin Arjun Kannan, as he unravels the dietary secrets of Harriers - a migratory bird of prey. Harriers are long distance migrants that come to the dry grasslands of India during the months of August to March. They travel thousands of kilometres from their breeding grounds in Central Asia to spend the winter in India, catching diverse kinds of prey. Through long term research, Arjun has tried to decode what they eat and whether their diet shifts between the regions and seasons within India. Learn how Harriers contribute to ecosystem services by forming vital links in the fragmented grassland habitats of India.",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what food security looks like in Indian cities?\n\nWhile urban conversations often focus on cutting carbs, counting calories, and following the latest diet trends, a very different story unfolds among the millions of low-skilled migrant workers who keep these cities running. Join Chetan Choithani as he explores the hidden face of urban food insecurity through the experiences of nearly 600 labour migrants in Bengaluru. Many of these workers leave their villages in search of better livelihoods, only to find themselves in precarious informal jobs that force them to compromise on their own nutrition\u2014skipping meals, eating poorly, and sometimes going hungry. Through their stories, this lecture reveals how India\u2019s food insecurity challenge is shifting\u2014from being largely rural to becoming an increasingly urban concern.",
