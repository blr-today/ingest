    "description": "Curious about the everyday science that goes into how we eat?\n\nJoin Jamie Allen for a hands-on gathering where participants cook, taste, and think together. As part of Agri-Cultures & Elemental Exchanges and the CALORIE season, this session aims to bring together people from all walks of life  around a shared table to explore the stories, materials, microbes, and memories that shape how we eat. \n\nParticipants bring ingredients, practices, tools, and ideas from their own work\u2014ranging from fermentation and food forests to tubers, dairy, soil, and water. Together  participants prepare a simple meal, share short reflections, and open up a space for discussions  around food futures, land relations, and more-than-human collaborations.",
