    "description": "Can science be effectively communicated through art? Where do the two fields intersect, and how can they offer us new ways to interrogate existing knowledge? Join Ravi Jambhekar in an hands-on exploration of how visual media can bring scientific concepts to life. Through the lens of natural history painting, Jambhekar will take us on a journey that brings together science and art.",

Over the last three decades, the city has grown rapidly from a manufacturing centre to a global hub for tech and start-ups, drawing on its strengths as a knowledge-based economy. Drawing on research conducted at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS), Neha Sami charts the journey of a city, from a small trading settlement to today\u2019s Bengaluru. It examines the multiple and intersecting transitions that the city has undergone: economic, environmental and spatial, layered over Bengaluru\u2019s physical and spatial features and the city\u2019s terrain.<br>",
