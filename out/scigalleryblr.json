    "description": "The River Landscapes workshop was an invitation to students, artists, creative practitioners and early career researchers in the age group 18-30 to think about and contribute to a glossary on fluvial landscapes in the form of writing, graphic/art, photographs or other media. The workshop aimed to pay particular attention to the story of the river Kaveri and its profound influence on the ecological, political and socio-cultural landscape of the region. Through the workshop, participants attempted to situate the historical and contemporary realities of Kaveri in the larger technocratic and socio-cultural imagination of river landscapes. <br><br>The outcomes of this workshop, including writings, artworks, photographs, and other media, will be on display. We invite you to come and explore these creative contributions that reflect on the Kaveri River and its evolving landscape.",

    "description": "How can we rethink Bengaluru\u2019s water crisis? Can we take action to create a more sustainable future?<br><br>Bengaluru often complains of too much water (flooding situations), too less water (shortage of water supply in summer), and also un-clean water. Where does the problem lie? How can WE work towards changing this narrative? <br>We often take water for granted\u2014until a crisis strikes. Too much water leads to floods, too little causes droughts, and contamination threatens the health of both humans and ecosystems. How can we shift our mindset to prioritise water security before it's too late? Join this interactive discussion and debate to understand these different threats to our water systems and participate in a unique role playing exercise that puts YOU in the driver's seat to solving these issues for our city.",
