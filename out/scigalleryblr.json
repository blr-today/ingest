    "description": "Join us for the screening of K100 Citizens\u2019 Waterway, a 2023 documentary that chronicles the transformation of a neglected stormwater drain in Bengaluru into a functional, flood-resilient public space. The film captures the people, processes, and challenges behind this pioneering urban infrastructure project. Conceived and steered by Mod Foundation, the K100 project is an example of how data, design, and inter-agency collaboration can redefine public infrastructure and urban life.<br><br>Presented at Science Gallery Bengaluru, the screening will be followed by a discussion with the Mod Foundation team and the filmmakers. Together, they will unpack the project's approach to informed decision-making, citizen participation, and data-driven governance, offering insights into what it takes to build resilient, inclusive cities in India today.",
