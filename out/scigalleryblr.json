    "description": "How does the body count calories, and are all calories truly equal?\n\nIn an age of calorie counters, fitness watches, and food labels, energy seems easy to measure and neatly quantified. Yet what happens inside the body is far more complex. In this talk, Prof. Ullas Kolthur Seetharam from the Advanced Research Unit on Metabolism, Development, and Aging (ARUMDA) looks beyond weight and BMI to examine how nutrition, metabolism, and body composition shape our health.\n\nDrawing on ARUMDA's research, he unpacks how the body processes food, senses energy needs, and adapts to growth, activity, and aging. He explores why calories are not all equal, how energy expenditure is regulated beyond what labels tell us, and what body composition reveals that body weight alone cannot. Bridging molecular biology, technology, and public health, the talk connects scientific insights to everyday questions around diet, growth, obesity, undernutrition, and metabolic disease. Offering a research-based view of how our bodies manage energy in this ever-changing food landscape.\n\nThis workshop explores the themes of \u2018EAT\u2019 & \u2018DIGEST\u2019 in relation to Science Gallery Bengaluru\u2019s Exhibition CALORIE. \n",

    "description": "What does the scale really tell us about our bodies?\n\nIn this workshop, Prof. Ullas Kolthur decodes our weight, looking at fat, muscle, and body water to better understand how our bodies store and use energy. Using a portable body composition analyser, he explores how nutrition, calories, and metabolism are measured, and where these measurements fall short.\n\nDrawing on both scientific research and lived experiences, the workshop invites participants to look beyond the scale and rethink what these numbers mean for health and nutrition. \n\nThis workshop explores the themes of \u2018EAT\u2019 & \u2018DIGEST\u2019 in relation to Science Gallery Bengaluru\u2019s Exhibition CALORIE.
