    "description": "Every artist has a recipe: a process of gathering ingredients, making creative choices, and shaping how their ideas are shared. Just as our bodies digest food, artists digest their experiences, breaking down observations, narratives, culture, and environments into creative work.\n\nThis walkthrough takes you behind the scenes of CALORIE, exploring how artists transform everyday experiences into art. By looking closely at their \u201cingredients,\u201d flavour profiles, textures, and choice of medium, we trace the journey from idea to finished work and uncover the many modes of expression artists use to make sense of food, culture, and lived experience.\n\nJoin our experimenters, Nirupama and Shreya, for a playful and participatory walkthrough that treats art-making as explorations, creativity as a shared process, and meaning-making as something we all do every day.",

Discover how food quietly shapes who we are, where we belong, and what we remember. Recognise disappearing food and the accompanying biodiversity loss. Understand how geographies and histories shape diets. Through this reflective session, learn to create food-identity records that can become part of a growing living archive in India.",
