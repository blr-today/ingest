    "description": "Sugar is a material full of contrasts, a sweet delight and a forbidden indulgence. Inspired by artist Jade Armstrong\u2019s original concept, this workshop explores the delicate balance between beauty, sweetness, and the fleeting nature of life.\n\nIn this workshop, Chef Pratyay will guide the participants to learn and to create intricate sugar-blown sculptures, each capturing a single breath and symbolising both the passage of time and the fragility of life. As these sculptures slowly melt into syrupy residue, they reflect sugar\u2019s transformation from a prized luxury to an overconsumed treat.\n\nThis hands-on experience encourages reflection on desire, decay, and consumption.",
