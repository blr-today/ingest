    "description": "Wistful Sunday mornings over chai and biscuits listening to the pattering of rain.\nRoasted rotis and sharing fragrant curries around a dining table.\nGoldeny sweet jalebes that capture the rich lights of festivals. Memories of food is more than its taste.\n\nJoin us on a walkthrough of Calorie where we explore food as nostalgia! Through art, stories, and interactive moments, we will explore the meals we once ignored, the flavors we miss the most, and the small rituals that quietly shaped us.\n\nCome for the stories, stay to colour.",

    "description": "Sunday mornings often begin with a peek into the fridge with wilted greens, sprouting spuds and a questionable stench, followed by the question: to eat or not to eat? Deciding what to consume and what to discard is a perennial struggle. In doing so, we enter uneasy intimacies shaped by affordance, access and surplus. \n\nIn this talk, Ritaban Ghosh examines food and waste, asking: where does the boundary between purity and contamination lie? What truly determines edibility? He traces the processes through which food comes to be classified as waste, while moving across the globe, where repurposed food becomes sustenance. From Mexico\u2019s *Huitlacoche*, a regional corn fungus delicacy, to Indonesia\u2019s *Kopi luwak*, coffee beans collected from Civet excrement, food is far more complex than we often assume.",

    "description": "Can we find mathematics outside of textbooks?\n\nJoin Disha as she explores mathematics through the art of paper folding. In particular, examining criteria for flat-foldability. Which is the conditions under which a given crease pattern can be folded flat and pressed inside a book without crumpling. \n\nThrough hands-on folding, participants will formulate conjectures, test their validity, and prove some of them together. No advanced mathematical background or prior experience with origami is required. Come with the curiosity to learn and a willingness to fold paper. Participants will not just get to take home the origami model that they fold, but also the mathematical ideas that emerge from the folding process.",

    "description": "How much is a quarter teaspoon? How do you fold in cheese?\n\nRecipes rely heavily on verbal instructions, and following them is often confusing. The Interaction Design Team from the National Institute of Design (NID) is reimagining how recipes are communicated. In this workshop, participants will generate custom recipe templates that are tangible, paper-based visual layouts for the ingredients and steps. They\u2019ll delve into prompt engineering and recipe visualisation and ultimately design an interactive and spatial recipe. So that the next time you\u2019re in the kitchen, following a recipe feels intuitive and fun, not confusing.\n\nThe workshop is designed for anyone interested in cooking from beginners to home cooks.",

The event highlights the human side of doing mathematics by reflecting on the challenges women have faced and the research they pursue today.\n\nPresented alongside Women of Mathematics, a photographic exhibition featuring 20 international women mathematicians curated by mathematician Sylvie Paycha and photographer Noel Tovia Matoff. It aims is to encourage young women to pursue careers in mathematics and theoretical physics, fields in which women remain underrepresented globally.",
