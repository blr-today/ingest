    "description": "Have we rewritten the history of the Iron Age? <br><br>Recent Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dates from coastal urn burial sites of Sivagalai and Adichnallur in Tamil Nadu have pushed back the timeline for the early finds of iron. Evidence indicates the use of iron emerged as early as about 3000 BCE, suggesting people and technology could have moved between Tamil Nadu and Harappan sites. In this lecture, archaeometallurgist Sharada Srinivasan will share ongoing research which enables us to rethink the first use of iron from an archaeometallurgical perspective. Using burial urns as a central motif, she will share contemporary theories and evidence to show how these discoveries of iron in Tamil Nadu might reshape our understanding of the emergence of iron and technologies around smelting.",

    "description": "TechnoCats, by filmmaker Gautam Sonti, offers an intimate portrait of life at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. It features seven students who crack the entrance exam against a million others - the \u201cSeven Samurai\u201d. We meet them in their first semester at IIT Delhi and then periodically over seven years, as they navigate intense academic and social pressures. Interwoven with stories from Sonti\u2019s own IIT batch 35 years ago, the film explores ambition, burnout, and the high cost of success. This is a special opportunity to view the film in its rough cut stage. Sonti looks forward to your feedback and support in helping bring TechnoCats to completion.",
