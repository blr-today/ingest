    "description": "How are people\u2019s online and offline lives connected? How do people navigate the space between the digital and the analogue, especially in the context of oppression? \n\nJoin Claire Crawford in a public lecture as she examines these questions from her forthcoming book, \u2018Tethered\u2019. The book combines ethnographic engagement with social movements and postcolonial ideas to understand why history and place matter. In the book she introduces \u2018tethering\u2019 as a simple way to recognise how digital change depends on context. The project addresses a \u2018blind spot\u2019 where many theories about digital change ignore differences between people and individual choice.",
