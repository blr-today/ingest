    "description": "How do bacteria and yeasts turn everyday foods into flavours that nourish your gut, your immunity, and your mood?\n\nJoin Pooja Dewan as she enters the microscopic kitchen and explores the science of fermentation. Watch microbes transform simple ingredients into fizzy, tangy, gut-loving foods; taste and sip fermentation in action; and discover how your gut microbiome powers energy, immunity, and wellbeing. You\u2019ll even get hands-on by creating your own mini ferment to take home. ",

    "description": "From packaging to clothes and now even in our food; plastics have found a \u2018home\u2019 everywhere. \n\nDespite growing concerns about its disposal starting as early as the 1960s, plastic production and use are only projected to grow. We know today that plastics are not only harmful in their everlasting afterlives but also in use - leaching millions of microplastics into food and water with every use. While reliance on plastics is a marker of living in the 21st century, how do we balance overconsumption and necessity? Join our Experimentor Ayati for this walkthrough as we attempt to look at the life-cycle of plastics and their role in our food systems through the CALORIE exhibition. ",

    "description": "What biases shape how machines see the world, and how can our conscious choices help make them more empathetic?\n\nRage Against the Machine is a playful critique of the biases embedded in computer vision algorithms, and an invitation to reflect on how conscious human choices can help build more empathetic machines. Join CALORIE artist Sahitya Papireddy as she uses Teachable Machine, a graphical and user-friendly tool for training machine-learning models. Participants will learn how to \u201cfeed\u201d a model with images to help it identify a cup, explore how a machine defines what a cup is\u2014and what it isn\u2019t\u2014and then attempt to \u201cbreak\u201d the model by uncovering loopholes in its detection system. Through this process, the session reveals how machines see the world, and how this perception can be surprisingly different from human vision.\n\nThe participants need to carry their own laptop that has a camera as well as a cup/mug of their choice. \n",

She reflects on what transforms eating from a mere task into a shared experience, drawing on the idea that \u201cwe are not only what we eat, but also who we eat with\u201d \u2014 Harry G. West.\n",

In a world obsessed with big data, large data models and digital automation, this workshop invites you to slow down and observe your daily lives with intention and curiosity. Participants will explore how to curate and make physical artefacts with their data. \n\nWhether you maintain detailed journals, use digital tracking apps, or are just curious to visualise a new year\u2019s resolution, you\u2019ll leave with a new perspective about data and its representation.",

    "description": "How is a portrait exhibition created, and how can it foreground the human side of mathematics?\n\nJoin photographer Noel Tovia Matoff, mathematician Sylvie Paycha, and physicist Sumati Surya for a panel discussion on the making of the upcoming exhibition Women of Mathematics. Bringing together photographic portraits and personal narratives of women mathematicians from around the world, the exhibition explores the lives, work, and intellectual journeys that shape the production of mathematics across different contexts. This discussion will unpack the process behind creating the portraits, how the women\u2019s experiences were documented, and how storytelling informed the exhibition\u2019s curatorial approach. The panel will reflect on how mathematics is produced by people rather than abstractions, and how attention to lived experience can make visible the institutional, cultural, and systemic conditions that shape participation in the field.",
