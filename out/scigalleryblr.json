    "description": "Sugar is a material full of contrasts, a sweet delight and a forbidden indulgence. Inspired by artist Jade Armstrong\u2019s original concept, this workshop explores the delicate balance between beauty, sweetness, and the fleeting nature of life.\n\nIn this workshop, Chef Pratyay will guide the participants to learn and to create intricate sugar-blown sculptures, each capturing a single breath and symbolising both the passage of time and the fragility of life. As these sculptures slowly melt into syrupy residue, they reflect sugar\u2019s transformation from a prized luxury to an overconsumed treat.\n\nThis hands-on experience encourages reflection on desire, decay, and consumption.",

    "description": "The Anthropocene has been proposed as an epoch in which human activity has become a defining force of planetary transformation. Yet, this raises crucial questions: who is implicated in these changes, and who bears responsibility? From the climate impacts of monocultures to global patterns of labour exploitation, the CALORIE exhibition-season explores complex questions around planetary health and human activity. \n\nLed by our Experimentors Ayati and Vinaya, we invite you to a walkthrough of CALORIE to critically engage with what the Anthropocene means and the challenges it poses to planetary health.
