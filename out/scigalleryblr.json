    "description": "From agriculture and real estate to mining and conservation, land is constantly being reordered in ways that are often contested and complex. As rural worlds become disembedded and de-agrarianisation takes hold, what gets left behind? This shift brings with it the loss of symbiotic relationships with land, traditional knowledge systems, cultural life-worlds, and a deep sense of belonging.<br><br>Join A R Vasavi for as she explores how shifting land use is reshaping our environments, identities, and ways of life in the contemporary world.<br><br>This programme is in collaboration with Infosys Science Foundation.<br>",

    "description": "How does a city influence its own climate and, how can we see it happen in real time? As Indian cities like Bengaluru expand, climate challenges like the heat island effect, flooding, and stresses on infrastructure are becoming impossible to ignore. Join CSTEP in a Masterclass that explores the fast-evolving field of urban climate research, using geospatial technologies to track and understand how cities interact with their environments. With Bengaluru as a case study, come examine how remote sensing and open-source tools like Google Earth Engine help map, measure, and respond to climate variability. From satellite data to street-level insights, join to learn how cities shape weather\u2014and how we can shape better cities.",

From clean energy to digital learning, we\u2019ll explore how scientific innovations, once confined to academic circles or research institutions, have been transformed into accessible tools to empower communities and drive social change. We explore the people behind the planning and execution of these ideas, as well as the ones making it accessible to the public.",
