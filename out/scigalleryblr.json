    "description": "Who can afford privacy?\n\nJoin us for a screening of TAAK, a tech noir film that examines how constant visibility becomes ordinary within institutions, and how its consequences are unevenly distributed across class, gender, labour, and access. Privacy emerges not as a universal right, but as something negotiated through behaviour, reputation, and constrained choice.\n\nThe evening brings together film, play and collective imagination to examine technology in the age of surveillance. We begin with a participatory game imagining more ethical futures for technology, followed by the film screening and a conversation with the Producer of TAAK, Ishan Hendre and digital rights activist and scholar, Usha Ramanathan.\n\nParticipatory Game: 5 PM\nScreening: 5:30 PM\nDiscussion: 6:15 PM\n\nProduced through the Museum of Imagined Futures Impact Film Accelerator, Taak is both a film and an impact campaign\u2014using cinema to spark public dialogue and imagine futures where technology respects privacy, agency, and human dignity.",

    "description": "How does the body count calories, and are all calories truly equal?\n\nIn an age of calorie counters, fitness watches, and food labels, energy seems easy to measure and neatly quantified. Yet what happens inside the body is far more complex. In this talk, Prof. Ullas Kolthur Seetharam from the Advanced Research Unit on Metabolism, Development, and Aging (ARUMDA) looks beyond weight and BMI to examine how nutrition, metabolism, and body composition shape our health.\n\nDrawing on ARUMDA's research, he unpacks how the body processes food, senses energy needs, and adapts to growth, activity, and aging. He explores why calories are not all equal, how energy expenditure is regulated beyond what labels tell us, and what body composition reveals that body weight alone cannot. Bridging molecular biology, technology, and public health, the talk connects scientific insights to everyday questions around diet, growth, obesity, undernutrition, and metabolic disease. Offering a research-based view of how our bodies manage energy in this ever-changing food landscape.\n\nThis workshop explores the themes of \u2018EAT\u2019 & \u2018DIGEST\u2019 in relation to Science Gallery Bengaluru\u2019s Exhibition CALORIE. \n",

    "description": "What does the scale really tell us about our bodies?\n\nIn this workshop, the ARUMDA Team decodes our weight, looking at fat, muscle, and body water to better understand how our bodies store and use energy. Using a portable body composition analyser, he explores how nutrition, calories, and metabolism are measured, and where these measurements fall short.\n\nDrawing on both scientific research and lived experiences, the workshop invites participants to look beyond the scale and rethink what these numbers mean for health and nutrition. \n\nThis workshop explores the themes of \u2018EAT\u2019 & \u2018DIGEST\u2019 in relation to Science Gallery Bengaluru\u2019s Exhibition CALORIE.

    "description": "Why does sugar feel irresistible? Why does loneliness change what we crave? And how can a single smell instantly transport you home?\n\nOf Minds, Moods, and Meals explores food as a meeting point between biology, emotion, neuroscience, and behaviour. Moving from neural reward pathways and microbial chemistry to inherited histories, we see how appetite is shaped long before it reaches the plate. Cravings are wired by evolution, moods are influenced by the gut, disgust protects and divides, and culture teaches us what is desirable, or forbidden. Food is not only nourishment; it is regulation, identity, attachment, and hierarchy. \n\nJoin our Experimentor Sai, for a walkthrough tracing these connections across body, brain, and society. \n\nCome curious. Leave seeing your plate differently.\n",
