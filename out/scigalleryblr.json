    "description": "On September 1, 1950, at the dawn of the Cold War, Italian physicist Bruno Pontecorvo and his family mysteriously disappeared, creating a political earthquake in Europe and the USA. Pontecorvo was globally known for his expertise in the sensitive field of nuclear research. His disappearance became one of the most fascinating mysteries of the atomic era, especially after it was revealed he had crossed the Iron Curtain to the Soviet Union. Closely tied to 20th-century history and particle physics, he made exceptional contributions to our understanding of the neutrino.\n\nJoin us for a screening of this compelling film, followed by a discussion with the writer, Giuseppe Mussardo, as he explores the life and legacy of Bruno Pontecorvo.",

As an artistic medium, carrying the weight of exploited bodies, scorched land, and transformed landscapes. Together, participants will construct a mural as a form of visual storytelling: not just aesthetic, but a material testimony to the extractive violence embedded in the global palm oil economy\n",

Drawing from a range of research on Asian honey bees and social wasps, she will highlight how foraging not only sustains the colony but also drives coordination, communication, and even decisions about reproduction. From the buzzing harmony of bee foragers to the role of nutrition in determining which wasps become queens, this talk uncovers the hidden power of food in shaping insect lives. Join us for a fascinating journey into the world of collective behaviour, division of labour, and the surprising social consequences of a simple resource.",
