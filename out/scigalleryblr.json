  "blurb": "Seen the virtual reality exhibit Carbon Nanoverse at CARBON, Science Gallery Bengaluru? Curious to know about the science behind it? Join us for a talk with materials scientist Dr Jacob Martin, who is part of the two-person team behind the exhibit!<br><br>Martin will focus on the science behind the lithium-ion batteries that are revolutionising our transport and are set to transform our electrical grid. But how do they work at the atomic scale? We will experience the atomic structure of a battery using computer visualisations and 3D glasses! Alongside this atom eye view, Jacob will share the materials science that led to the discovery of the battery, and his recent work on manufacturing battery grade graphite.",

How can you translate data from the lab into a sound installation? <br><br>This workshop explores the artistic practices used to create the soundscape for the installation <i>Movement 1: Nanomorphology</i> featured at CARBON. The artist will share digital tools made in Max MSP, and run a session on how to use the tools with text files of two-dimensional scientific, numerical data. <br>",
