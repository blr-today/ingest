    "description": "Can exploring quantum physics through art change the way we experience reality and consciousness? Come join Robert Lisek and Dayita Nereyeth as they delve into the evolving landscape of human consciousness. This visionary performance will explore the intersections of quantum physics, artificial intelligence, human cognition, and artistic expression, merging these fields into a unique experience that is both philosophical inquiry and experiential art. <br>Set in a dynamic space where laser lights, video projections, and dance respond to quantum principles like superposition, entanglement, interference, and decoherence, SUPERPOSITION reflects the fluid interconnectedness of human thought.<br><br>This immersive installation encourages participants to experience multiple states of being and perceive layers of reality beyond ordinary perception.",
