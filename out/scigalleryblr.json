    "description": "Climate change and climate action have entered into the vocabulary of our daily lives. Yet beyond making posters and talking about tokenistic solutions we still know little about it. The \u2018Understanding Climate Change: Questioning Beliefs, Myths and Facts\u2019 workshop is a gamified way for students to question beliefs, myths and facts and develop an enhanced understanding of the topic. The intention of this workshop is to move beyond the buzzwords and cliches and get initiated into understanding not only how climate change affects us but how we can create impact at personal and societal levels.<br><br>This programme is supported by the American Centre Chennai.
