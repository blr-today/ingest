    "description": "What drives the complex lives of social insects like honey bees and wasps? \n\nJoin Sruthi Unnikrishnan as she explores how food, more than just sustenance, shapes the social structure and behaviour of insect societies. Drawing from a range of research on Asian honey bees and social wasps, she will highlight how foraging not only sustains the colony but also drives coordination, communication, and even decisions about reproduction. From the buzzing harmony of bee foragers to the role of nutrition in determining which wasps become queens, this talk uncovers the hidden power of food in shaping insect lives. Join us for a fascinating journey into the world of collective behaviour, division of labour, and the surprising social consequences of a simple resource.",
