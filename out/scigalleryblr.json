    "description": "What stories emerge when we approach science through the lens of language? Could our relationship with science be any better if we approach the language used and its style with more ease and curiosity?<br><br>Come dive into these questions in this interactive walkthrough-cum-workshop of our current exhibition-season, Sci560. We talk about language in the context of electoral politics, astronomy, technology, education, and big-problems of our age like the climate crisis. We will gently flex our lingual muscles with activities around reading, writing, translating, zine-making, and discussions.<br><br>Cut through the noise of rule-making and propriety around language with mediator Vignesh and explore the intersections of language and science.",
