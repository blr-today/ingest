    "description": "What do we know of the lives of logistics workers? What can a life on the seas, aboard a container ship, be like? The body of the logistics worker is the fulcrum upon which global systems of power and trade rest. But it is also a body on which gendered and racialised pressures rest. In this masterclass, Laleh Khalili will draw on her ongoing research and experiences of travelling on cargo ships to explore the life of these labourers. Join us to  investigate an experience riddled with adversities\u2014loneliness, loss, and violence, stolen wages and exploitative logistics businesses\u2014as well as ephemeral moments of joy and solidarity. <br><br>Please note that this is a 2-day masterclass which will take place on Saturday and Sunday, 27 and 28 April.",

    "description": "How do we understand human evolution through archeology? And what role does carbon play in this? Dive into a two-day masterclass with archaeometallurgist Sharada Srinivasan, who will talk about the carbon in both organic and inorganic archaeomaterials. From carbon black used by ancient Egyptians to the famous diamond mines in Golconda, discover how carbon finds its way into a vast array of materials like iron and steel. <br><br>For example, delve into the saga of India\u2019s legendary high carbon wootz steel, made particularly in southern India, known as \u2018ukku\u2019\u2014likely the earliest known high grade steel. Since the role of carbon as a separate alloying element was not well understood, numerous studies were made by 18th and 19th century European scientists (including Faraday) to replicate wootz steel. These spurred several important discoveries leading up to the Industrial Revolution. <br><br>Join Sharada Shrinivasan as she brings together theoretical perspectives with hands-on experiences which explore the role of carbon in the firing of pottery kilns!<br><br>This masterclass is supported by the NIAS - TCS Heritage Initiative.",
