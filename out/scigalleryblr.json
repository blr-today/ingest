    "description": "Why are insects the largest and most diverse group of animals? Is it because they can fly?<br><br>Both in terms of biomass and diversity, insects are the most successful animals from an evolutionary viewpoint. Much of this success owes to the fact that they were the first animals to evolve flight about 350-400 million years ago. This meant that they could access remote habitats and traverse greater distances than other animals. They could also evade predators, chase prey and guard territories. Insect flight occurs at extremely rapid timescales, and their fine movements are often invisible to us because they occur too fast. It is fascinating therefore to understand how the insect body and nervous system cope with the need to be both fast and precise.<br><br>Join Sanjay Sane in a lecture exploring these themes with a focus on the research in his lab.<br><br>This lecture will take place on the NCBS campus and prior registration is required.<br>",

    "description": "Sanjay Sane\u2019s Lab at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) is interested in questions around insects, specifically insect flight and more recently, termite mounds.<br>Their lab combines inputs from physics, engineering, biomechanics, neurobiology, muscle mechanics and behavioural biology to address diverse flight-related phenomena. To study these questions, they use diverse techniques such as high-speed videography, behavioural measurements, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.<br><br>Join us to learn about their process.<br><br>This event will take place on the NCBS campus and prior registration is required.",
