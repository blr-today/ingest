How do we understand these insect societies? Dive into ant-hills, wasp nests, and beehives by joining us for this talk by ecologist Raghavendra Gadagkar, who will share his research around the Indian paper wasp <i>Ropalidia marginata</i>. Learn about the observational and experimental methods used to study insects, discover contemporary research around these bugs, and judge how much we know of this often-forgotten society!",

    "description": "How do we use space while curating exhibitions? How can a spatial layout transform individual artworks to successfully convey large themes around ecology and the environment? Is there anything like an 'unsuitable' space? <br><br>In this workshop, join curator Julia Wintner to explore questions around space and curation\u2014from building relationships with artists to understanding the spatial concerns of an exhibition. With guidance from her, you will also get to conceptualise a speculative art display in a space at Science Gallery Bengaluru. ",
