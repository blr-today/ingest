    "description": "How do we understand human evolution through archaeology? And what role does carbon play in this? Dive into a two-day masterclass with archaeometallurgist Sharada Srinivasan, who will talk about the carbon in both organic and inorganic archaeomaterials. From carbon black used by ancient Egyptians to the famous diamond mines in Golconda, discover how carbon finds its way into a vast array of materials like iron and steel. <br><br>For example, delve into the saga of India\u2019s legendary high carbon wootz steel, made particularly in southern India, known as \u2018ukku\u2019\u2014likely the earliest known high grade steel. Since the role of carbon as a separate alloying element was not well understood, numerous studies were made by 18th and 19th century European scientists (including Faraday) to replicate wootz steel. These spurred several important discoveries leading up to the Industrial Revolution. <br><br>Join Sharada Shrinivasan as she brings together theoretical perspectives with hands-on experiences which explore the role of carbon in the firing of pottery kilns!<br><br>This masterclass is supported by the NIAS - TCS Heritage Initiative.",
