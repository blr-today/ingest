    "description": "What does \u2018material\u2019 or \u2018medium\u2019 mean to an artist? Do materials themselves provide rich narratives and social histories? Visual artist Arunkumar H G certainly thinks so! In this workshop he delves into the origins and historical contexts of materials, while they transform from resources to waste. <br><br>For this workshop, you are encouraged to bring your own accumulation of waste, to examine how we perceive and interpret waste. You will then work with Arunkumar H G to transform these materials into art objects, highlighting the qualities and significance of the seemingly mundane.",

    "description": "What if an artist gives up their brush to play chess, and in doing so, finds deep connections between seemingly opposite worlds? This lecture dives into the fascinating intersections between art and science, inspired by the artist Marcel Duchamp and the Ukrainian-French chess grandmaster Vitaly Halberstadt. Together, they explored the intricate world of chess endgames in their book,<i> Oppositions and Sister Squares are Reconciled</i>. Duchamp, who left his artistic career for chess, saw strategic parallels that connect both fields. This lecture isn't just about chess, though. It's about how art and science, often seen as opposites, share surprising connections and contrasts. <br><br>Presented by Diemut Strebe, Artist in Residence at the MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology this lecture will explore how science perceives colours, smells, and sounds\u2014central to aesthetics\u2014and whether these experiences are devalued as illusory.<br>A highlight of the lecture will be <i>The Redemption of Vanity</i>, an artwork featuring the \"Blackest Black\" on Earth, created with nanotube technology and applied to a $2 million diamond, examined as both an aesthetic and technical marvel. <br><br>",

    "description": "Have you ever dreamed of a world where we could fly without fossil fuels? Join us for India\u2019s first ever Aerocene event, where Art, Science, and Sustainability converge! <br>As a movement for eco-social justice, adrift on air, floating free from fossil fuels, lithium or hydrogen, the Aerocene project created by Tomas Saraceno moves us towards an ethical re-alliance with the Earth and its cosmic web(s) of life. The Aerocene Backpack is a portable floating kit, which enables anyone to launch their own aerosolar sculpture and start sensing the ocean of air, lifted only by the sun,without the use of fossil fuels, helium, hydrogen, solar panels, or batteries.<br>This innovative experience is designed to engage participants in thinking-through-making activity, stimulating imagination and creativity, and imparting information about solar balloon flight, thermodynamic physics, meteorological science, and art practices. Don't miss this chance to see the skies filled with flight sculptures, and to learn more about the possibilities of a fossil-fuel-free world. <br>As we learn to attune to the weather and adapt to new climates, Aerocene flight activities are weather dependent. <br><br><br>",

We will showcase a distinctive collection of cinematic narratives centred on the theme of carbon and bring to life stories that span generations, reflecting both the past and the ever-evolving present.

We are offering a wide array of films spanning different languages, including German, English, French, and Hindi, and genres, from documentary features and narrative features to docufictions and animated shorts.
