They help us observe, experiment, measure, calculate, and model the world around us. These tools sit at the intersection between the history of science and the history of technology, and negotiate between scientific knowledge and processes, innovation and industrial production. They are not only tools of scientific research but also tools of science dissemination and teaching.<br><br>Join Roland Wittje in a talk on historical scientific instruments and experiments, and how they relate to the nature of science and the relationship between science and society.",
