    "description": "What drives the complex lives of social insects like honey bees and wasps? \n\nJoin Sruthi Unnikrishnan as she explores how food, more than just sustenance, shapes the social structure and behaviour of insect societies. Drawing from a range of research on Asian honey bees and social wasps, she will highlight how foraging not only sustains the colony but also drives coordination, communication, and even decisions about reproduction. From the buzzing harmony of bee foragers to the role of nutrition in determining which wasps become queens, this talk uncovers the hidden power of food in shaping insect lives. Join us for a fascinating journey into the world of collective behaviour, division of labour, and the surprising social consequences of a simple resource.",

    "description": "What is the relationship between caste and food?\n\nCome Eat With Me is a performance piece by Sri Vamsi Matta that explores the relationship between caste and food while sharing a meal together. Focusing on Dalit Cuisine, Vamsi begins with personal stories and oral histories around food in his household and community. The performance is peppered with existing literature and academic writing around the multilayered, many-flavoured relationships between caste and food. The piece unpacks questions of oppression and solidarity, grief and joy, and the everyday victories of the human spirit in the face of structural injustices.\nAudiences are invited to eat together and share their own stories around caste and food. Please note that the performance will be for 2 hours, and dinner will be served afterwards. ",

    "description": "How has nutrition research standardised the Indian Diet?\n\nJoin Veena Shatrugna as she explores how nutrition research in India has influenced the nation's eating habits. By the 1970s, scientific studies were guiding farming policy, school meals, wages, and even doctors\u2019 advice. In the push to design the most affordable national diet, calories and proteins from different foods were treated as equal. This put low-cost plant foods at the centre, leaving little room to account for India\u2019s rich food cultures and the needs of children and pregnant women. Alongside this, the importance of animal proteins, from foods eaten regularly by different castes was erased. Veena will further explore the policy choices behind that shift and the lasting mark they have left on everyday diets.",
