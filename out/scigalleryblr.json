    "description": "South Asia and the Institute: Transformational Connections showcases the longstanding connections between MIT and South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal) that go back more than 140 years. <br>The Institute\u2019s past and present has been enriched as much by South Asian students and faculty as their lives have been shaped by the Institute. Perched at the forefront of technological revolutions across the globe, MIT\u2019s South Asians have negotiated a changing world of race and immigration in America, and decolonization and nation-building in South Asia.  South Asia and the Institute makes these transformative connections visible. <br>Join us for a conversation on the influence of science and technology education and the screening of the documentary, \u201cRevolution on the Ganga: The Making of the Technological Indian.\u201d",

They help us observe, experiment, measure, calculate, and model the world around us. These tools sit at the intersection between the history of science and the history of technology, and negotiate between scientific knowledge and processes, innovation and industrial production.
