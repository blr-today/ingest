As rural worlds become disembedded and de-agrarianisation takes hold, what gets left behind? This shift brings with it the loss of symbiotic relationships with land, traditional knowledge systems, cultural life-worlds, and a deep sense of belonging.<br><br>Join A R Vasavi for as she explores how shifting land use is reshaping our environments, identities, and ways of life in the contemporary world.<br><br>This programme is in collaboration with Infosys Science Foundation.<br>",
