    "description": "Wistful Sunday mornings over chai and biscuits listening to the pattering of rain.\nRoasted rotis and sharing fragrant curries around a dining table.\nGoldeny sweet jalebes that capture the rich lights of festivals. Memories of food is more than its taste.\n\nJoin us on a walkthrough of Calorie where we explore food as nostalgia! Through art, stories, and interactive moments, we will explore the meals we once ignored, the flavors we miss the most, and the small rituals that quietly shaped us.\n\nCome for the stories, stay to colour.",

    "description": "How much is a quarter teaspoon? How do you fold in cheese?\n\nRecipes rely heavily on verbal instructions, and following them is often confusing. The Interaction Design Team from the National Institute of Design (NID) is reimagining how recipes are communicated. In this workshop, participants will generate custom recipe templates that are tangible, paper-based visual layouts for the ingredients and steps. They\u2019ll delve into prompt engineering and recipe visualisation and ultimately design an interactive and spatial recipe. So that the next time you\u2019re in the kitchen, following a recipe feels intuitive and fun, not confusing.\n\nThe workshop is designed for anyone interested in cooking from beginners to home cooks.",

    "description": "How does the body count calories, and are all calories truly equal?\n\nIn an age of calorie counters, fitness watches, and food labels, energy seems easy to measure and neatly quantified. Yet what happens inside the body is far more complex. In this talk, Prof. Ullas Kolthur Seetharam from the Advanced Research Unit on Metabolism, Development, and Aging (ARUMDA) looks beyond weight and BMI to examine how nutrition, metabolism, and body composition shape our health.\n\nDrawing on ARUMDA's research, he unpacks how the body processes food, senses energy needs, and adapts to growth, activity, and aging. He explores why calories are not all equal, how energy expenditure is regulated beyond what labels tell us, and what body composition reveals that body weight alone cannot. Bridging molecular biology, technology, and public health, the talk connects scientific insights to everyday questions around diet, growth, obesity, undernutrition, and metabolic disease. Offering a research-based view of how our bodies manage energy in this ever-changing food landscape.\n\nThis workshop explores the themes of \u2018EAT\u2019 & \u2018DIGEST\u2019 in relation to Science Gallery Bengaluru\u2019s Exhibition CALORIE. \n",
