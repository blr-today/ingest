    "description": "Are India\u2019s monkeys adapting to urban life? Can monkeys and humans continue to coexist in rapidly growing cities? <br><br>Nonhuman life has traditionally coexisted rather peacefully with human communities across the Indian subcontinent. However, this coexistence is now under severe threat from rapid urbanisation. This has led to widespread environmental loss, seriously affecting the lives of most primate populations, even within protected forests. Several populations are becoming increasingly synergised, with various urbanising influences forcing individual nonhuman primates to adapt to these novel socioecologies for their survival.<br>Join Anindya Sinha as he shares fascinating stories of how bonnet and rhesus monkeys in southern and northern India are adapting to rapidly changing environments. Discover how urbanisation is reshaping their behaviors, forcing them to navigate human-altered habitats in ways that make them human-like.",
