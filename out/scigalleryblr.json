    "description": "How are specimens collected, preserved, and studied?<br><br>Join us at the Natural History Collections at NCBS and discover the fascinating world of specimens. This visit will be an opportunity to see how scientists collect, preserve, and study specimens that help us understand the story of our planet\u2019s biodiversity. From pressed plants and drawers full of insects to preserved bird specimens, every item offers clues about biodiversity, evolution, and environmental change. Participants will also learn how these collections support research, education, and conservation, and hear the stories behind them.<br><br>",

    "description": "What do the landscape markers of Bangalore reveal about its people and their relationship with nature? <br><br>The territory of Bangalore is a complex composition of rocky outcrops, high grounds, flat lands and valleys. The process of occupation is premised on the idea of effective management of water and its associated infrastructure \u2013 both manmade and natural. The natural capacity of the land finds varied expressions in human use \u2013 from settlements to sacred groves, from seasonal and perennial agriculture to grasslands. Join Dr. Mohan Rao as he unpacks the complex mosaic of Bangalore\u2019s landscape, where markers of culture and belief\u2014both sacred and everyday\u2014are deeply embedded. These layered terrains can be seen as \u2018watermarked\u2019 by human interaction, creating a powerful sense of place, belonging, and identity, and reflecting a longstanding relationship between society and nature.<br><br>This programme is in collaboration with Integrated Design.",

Join Anjali Karol Mohan, Sony Pellissery, Brinda Sastry, Sandhya Naidu, and Mohan Rao in a panel discussion that explores how we might rethink these shared spaces\u2014from blue-green infrastructure and historic water systems to the governance of condominiums and the politics of public space design. Through diverse perspectives, the panel examines how collective stewardship, inclusive planning, and community-led design can help reimagine commons in ways that are ecologically sustainable, socially just, and deeply rooted in local context.<br><br>This programme is in collaboration with Integrated Design.",
