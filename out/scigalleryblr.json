    "description": "How has the desire for self-reliance evolved in Bengaluru? <br>In recent years, slogans to \u2018Make in India\u2019, harnessing a desire to become Self Reliant or Atmanirbhar Bharat have become ubiquitous. As ambitious as they are, they are not new. The early years of newly decolonized India, much like many other nascent nations across Asia and Africa, embraced self-reliance as a way of achieving economic and political independence from imperial powers.<br>A number of these technological and industrial projects were located in the city of Bengaluru, making it a true city of Science and Technology. At different points these projects enrolled key actors, from the model citizen-worker to the \u2018tech entrepreneur\u2019. Join Aditi Dey as she traces these episodes of Bengaluru\u2019s history and the emergence of the celebrated figure of the \u2018tech entrepreneur\u2019. Diving into the history of technopolitics in Bengaluru.",
