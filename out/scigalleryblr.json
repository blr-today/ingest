    "description": "Why are so few of India\u2019s women employed? What does it mean to be counted as employed? What kinds of employment do women predominantly engage in, particularly in our cities?  Come join Rosa Abraham as she explores how labour force surveys measure employment and discuss the implications for the measurement of women\u2019s work. <br><br>Until recently, the proportion of employed women has steadily declined in rural areas and stagnated in urban areas. There have been several explanations for the low and declining rates of participation of women in the workforce. One perspective argues that women's domestic work, care burden and gender-based norms keep women out of the paid workforce. A more recent argument points towards the lack of job creation as a fundamental reason for fewer women in the workforce. Drawing on primary surveys and official secondary data, Rosa will examine each of these explanations to better understand the reasons behind the persistently low and falling rates of women\u2019s employment in India.<br>",
