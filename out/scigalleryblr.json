    "description": "From packaging to clothes and now even in our food; plastics have found a \u2018home\u2019 everywhere. \n\nDespite growing concerns about its disposal starting as early as the 1960s, plastic production and use are only projected to grow. We know today that plastics are not only harmful in their everlasting afterlives but also in use - leaching millions of microplastics into food and water with every use. While reliance on plastics is a marker of living in the 21st century, how do we balance overconsumption and necessity? Join our Experimentor Ayati for this walkthrough as we attempt to look at the life-cycle of plastics and their role in our food systems through the CALORIE exhibition. ",
