    "description": "What does it take to keep AI running?\n\nAI chatbots, self-driving cars, and social media platforms may appear seamless and autonomous, but they depend on vast networks of human labour. A large workforce of people, scattered across the world, provides data for training AI models, and removes harmful content released online, among other kinds of work. They often work in very harsh conditions; with low pay, inadequate support and social security, under uncertain terms, and often at great personal risk.\n\n\u2018In the pipeline\u2019 is a card game that tries to demonstrate the problems workers face in their roles in content moderation and AI labour. Players will navigate these industries while enduring different hazards and bearing related costs. As players navigate shifting industry demands, workplace hazards, and economic uncertainty, they confront the invisible costs behind \u201cintelligent\u201d systems.\n\nThrough play, the workshop opens up conversations around precarity, advocacy, and the structural changes needed to imagine fairer technological futures.\n",

    "description": "Why does sugar feel irresistible? Why does loneliness change what we crave? And how can a single smell instantly transport you home?\n\nOf Minds, Moods, and Meals explores food as a meeting point between biology, emotion, neuroscience, and behaviour. Moving from neural reward pathways and microbial chemistry to inherited histories, we see how appetite is shaped long before it reaches the plate. Cravings are wired by evolution, moods are influenced by the gut, disgust protects and divides, and culture teaches us what is desirable, or forbidden. Food is not only nourishment; it is regulation, identity, attachment, and hierarchy. \n\nJoin our Experimentor Sai, for a walkthrough tracing these connections across body, brain, and society. \n\nCome curious. Leave seeing your plate differently.\n",

    "description": "Every artist has a recipe: a process of gathering ingredients, making creative choices, and shaping how their ideas are shared. Just as our bodies digest food, artists digest their experiences, breaking down observations, narratives, culture, and environments into creative work.\n\nThis walkthrough takes you behind the scenes of CALORIE, exploring how artists transform everyday experiences into art. By looking closely at their \u201cingredients,\u201d flavour profiles, textures, and choice of medium, we trace the journey from idea to finished work and uncover the many modes of expression artists use to make sense of food, culture, and lived experience.\n\nJoin our experimenters, Nirupama and Shreya, for a playful and participatory walkthrough that treats art-making as explorations, creativity as a shared process, and meaning-making as something we all do every day.",
