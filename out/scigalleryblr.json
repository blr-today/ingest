    "description": "Sugar is a material full of contrasts, a sweet delight and a forbidden indulgence. Inspired by artist Jade Armstrong\u2019s original concept, this workshop explores the delicate balance between beauty, sweetness, and the fleeting nature of life.\n\nIn this workshop, Chef Pratyay will guide the participants to learn and to create intricate sugar-blown sculptures, each capturing a single breath and symbolising both the passage of time and the fragility of life. As these sculptures slowly melt into syrupy residue, they reflect sugar\u2019s transformation from a prized luxury to an overconsumed treat.\n\nThis hands-on experience encourages reflection on desire, decay, and consumption.",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what food security looks like in Indian cities?\n\nWhile urban conversations often focus on cutting carbs, counting calories, and following the latest diet trends, a very different story unfolds among the millions of low-skilled migrant workers who keep these cities running. Join Chetan Choithani as he explores the hidden face of urban food insecurity through the experiences of nearly 600 labour migrants in Bengaluru. Many of these workers leave their villages in search of better livelihoods, only to find themselves in precarious informal jobs that force them to compromise on their own nutrition\u2014skipping meals, eating poorly, and sometimes going hungry. Through their stories, this lecture reveals how India\u2019s food insecurity challenge is shifting\u2014from being largely rural to becoming an increasingly urban concern.",

How big can a system get before it stops behaving quantum mechanically and hews to theories of classical physics? Does nature have a quantum-classical boundary?. Explore the prize winners work in showing quantum mechanical tunneling and other quantum effects in macroscopic electrical circuits, suggesting that quantum theory remains applicable as objects get bigger. Anil will discuss the work that won the Nobel Prize, how it pushed the quantum-classical boundary beyond previously known limits, and the implications for technologies such as quantum computers.\n\nThe lecture will be followed by a panel discussion on Quantum Mechanics with Arindam Ghosh and Shobhana Narasimhan.",

And we realise that across the planet, all humans have the same hopes and fears, the same desires and anxieties. More than any other discipline, literature demonstrates and celebrates our common humanity. The number of literary prizes has grown rapidly in the last few decades, especially prizes for a single book. Where have these prizes come from and whom do they go to? This talk looks at some of the political, aesthetic and commercial interests that lie behind literary prizes.",
