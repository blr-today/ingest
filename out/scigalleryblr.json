    "description": "What does \u2018material\u2019 or \u2018medium\u2019 mean to an artist? Do materials themselves provide rich narratives and social histories? Visual artist Arunkumar H G certainly thinks so! In this workshop he delves into the origins and historical contexts of materials, while they transform from resources to waste. <br><br>For this workshop, you are encouraged to bring your own accumulation of waste, to examine how we perceive and interpret waste. You will then work with Arunkumar H G to transform these materials into art objects, highlighting the qualities and significance of the seemingly mundane.",

    "description": "Join political scientist Rohit Chandra, social scientist Radhika Krishnan and physicist Shoibal Chakravarty to dive into the complexities of energy transition in India. This masterclass will be spread over two sessions, exploring the transition from fossil fuels to alternative sources. <br><br>Session 1<br><br>How do we understand energy transition dynamics through the lens of labour and work? What are the working conditions in coal-dependent regions of India? Where do these workers' lives intersect with local institutions? Join Radhika Krishnan and Rohit Chandra to think about some of the labour realities of the energy transition. Rooted in social science methods, this masterclass session will prompt you to consider the perspective of India's millions of energy-sector workers when thinking about energy transitions.<br><br><br>Session 2<br><br>How do we decide what energy technologies to use for the next half-century? What kinds of social, economic, and environmental factors need consideration when making such decisions? In this session, Shoibal Chakravarty and political scientist Rohit Chandra will unpack some of the pressing trade-offs in India's energy transition. This masterclass will explore trade-offs as varied as energy poverty, employment, public health and regional equity. By evaluating some of these trade-offs using economic and techno-economic methods, you can learn how to assess these trade-offs at different levels of magnification (individual, firm, state, country).
