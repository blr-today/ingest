    "description": "Have you ever wondered how the Sun influences life on Earth beyond just providing light and warmth? The Sun's magnetic activities, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, can cause space weather events that disrupt satellites, power grids, and communication systems. Understanding the science behind space weather and its effects on modern technology is key to grasping Earth\u2019s relationship with the Sun. India has made significant contributions to solar research\u2014from over a century of observations at the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory to the Aditya-L1 mission and the proposed National Large Solar Telescope\u2014highlighting the need for continued solar exploration. Join Jayant Joshi to explore the Sun, space weather, and India\u2019s efforts to understand our nearest star.",
