    "description": "Set in the once thriving colonial gold mining township of Kolar Gold Fields (KGF), In Search of Gold attempts to weave together the different lived and remembered histories of people who built this highly profitable enterprise. Against the background of the grim imagery of the now defunct mining operations, the film brings together narratives of collective socio-political struggles of the past, nostalgia for lost privileges and communities, and the anxiety of an uncertain future, of a fragmented society.<br><br>Join filmmaker Basav Biradar and physicists Nirmal Raj and Palahalli Vishwanath as they explore the legacy of Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) from both historical and scientific perspectives.",

How can monitoring pollution levels help address urban challenges?<br><br>Join Priyanka Jamwal and her team at the Water and Soil laboratory at the Ashoka Trust For Research In Ecology And The Environment (ATREE). We will explore the scientific methods used to monitor and analyse water and soil pollution. Participants will tour the lab and learn how data on pollution is collected, processed, and used to tackle environmental problems. The visit will also demonstrate how this data is applied to plan, design, and evaluate solutions aimed at improving water and soil quality.",
