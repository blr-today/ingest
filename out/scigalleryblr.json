    "description": "Over the past 12 months, our Mediators have engaged with Sci560 in ways perhaps no one else has had the opportunity to, and have donned many hats in the gallery. Out of this close relationship, comes rich experience that touches every nook and cranny of life. So much to say, our mediator showcase for the Sci560 exhibition-season is to delve into some of that experience, through the thoughtful and engaging segments curated by our mediators.",
