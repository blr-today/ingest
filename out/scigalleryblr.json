    "description": "For the past few decades, human activity has left an indelible mark on the Earth, leading to the proposed geological epoch called the Anthropocene. Though there is still debate on when the Anthropocene has started, in the midst of the climate crisis, there is an urgent call to acknowledge our lasting influence on the planet.<br>Join mediators Fathima Aslaha and Gaayatri Chandrasekharan as they explore the Anthropocene through the lens of Bengaluru\u2014a city where nature perseveres amidst the pressures of rapid urbanisation. Using the Sci560 exhibition season as an anchor, they ask what a sustainable future in the city looks like.",
