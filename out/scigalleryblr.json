Sharing insights from his research into how a rich diversity of frogs and toads helps sustain our ecosystems and agricultural landscapes. He will explore their vital role as natural pest controllers and how they could be a powerful antidote to the excessive spraying of pesticides. The talk will also have an interactive component where he will show how a healthy frog population is directly linked to the food we eat through a short game.",

    "description": "Have you ever instantly recognised a face or completely missed one?\n\nFaces are the foundation of human connection, yet our understanding of face perception has been shaped almost entirely by studies on Western populations. India, home to one-sixth of the world\u2019s population, has remained absent from this research despite its immense diversity. Join SP Arun and Vaishnavi Mohite as they introduce the first large-scale project on face perception in India, focused on individuals with extraordinary recognition abilities (super recognisers) and those with severe impairments (prosopagnosia). \n\nThey will discuss the development of the Indian Face Memory Test (IFMT), a tool tailored to the unique features of Indian faces, and standardising clinical protocols for prosopagnosia research in the country. This project not only replicates classic findings such as the face inversion effect across cultures but also asks new questions, such as how contextual cues like clothing, voice, and hairstyle aid recognition when face perception fails. By combining behavioural measures with computational modelling, they aim to uncover both universal and culturally specific principles of face perception.\n",
