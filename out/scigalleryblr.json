    "description": "Ever wondered how to analyse galaxy features from deep imaging surveys? Join us in the exciting \"OMG: One Million Galaxies\" workshop, where you'll work with real data from the 8-meter Subaru telescope! This citizen science project, developed by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) in collaboration with the Pune Knowledge Cluster and led by Prof. Sudhanshu Barway, invites you to dive into the cosmos.<br>With telescopes worldwide generating terabytes to petabytes of data every night, astronomy is more accessible than ever. Citizen science empowers anyone with a passion for space to explore multi-wavelength data, contributing to groundbreaking discoveries. OMG, one of India's key initiatives, engages volunteers in understanding the science behind galaxy pattern recognition. <br><br>Participants are required to bring their personal laptops for this programme.",

    "description": "Curious about the fascinating history of modern astronomy in India? From a private observatory in Chennai in 1786 to the establishment of the Madras Observatory by the East India Company in 1792 and its century of achievements, India\u2019s astronomical journey is captivating. The founding of the Kodaikanal Observatory in 1899 to study the Sun led to the formation of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) in 1971, now located in Koramangala, Bengaluru.<br>Join facilitators from IIA  as they explore its rich and diverse roots, shaped by colonial endeavours, European scientific advancements, indigenous knowledge, and the global spread of scientific practices. They will take you on a journey through key milestones in this history, focusing on IIA\u2019s role, from the Madras Observatory\u2019s discoveries to the two 1800s instruments loaned to Sci560. Along the way, you'll uncover the discovery of Helium, the intersection of traditional and modern astronomical calculations, and the longest continuous solar observations. Don\u2019t miss this opportunity to delve into India's astronomical legacy!",
