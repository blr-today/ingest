    "description": "Science is often envisioned as a pursuit carried out by individuals with extensive formal education and in controlled environments equipped with complex instruments. While this is one way science is practiced, there are many other ways it takes shape, ways that are often unnoticed.<br><br>This walkthrough is an attempt to highlight how science is often practiced in spaces far removed from sophisticated laboratories, driven by collaboration among individuals with diverse skills, perspectives, and knowledge. We will also explore how science reaches beyond these spaces to engage with the general public, fostering understanding and curiosity through science communication, and demonstrating how scientific discoveries translate into tangible benefits for society.<br><br>Through exhibits in the Gallery, you\u2019ll discover stories of science emerging in unexpected ways and through unique approaches. Join mediator Gokul as he invites you to reflect on the dynamic, collaborative, and applied nature of science, thriving in various forms and spaces, and ultimately shaping the world around us.",

    "description": "The River Landscapes workshop was an invitation to students, artists, creative practitioners and early career researchers in the age group 18-30 to think about and contribute to a glossary on fluvial landscapes in the form of writing, graphic/art, photographs or other media. The workshop aimed to pay particular attention to the story of the river Kaveri and its profound influence on the ecological, political and socio-cultural landscape of the region. Through the workshop, participants attempted to situate the historical and contemporary realities of Kaveri in the larger technocratic and socio-cultural imagination of river landscapes. <br><br>The outcomes of this workshop, including writings, artworks, photographs, and other media, will be on display. We invite you to come and explore these creative contributions that reflect on the Kaveri River and its evolving landscape.",
