    "description": "The River Landscapes workshop was an invitation to students, artists, creative practitioners and early career researchers in the age group 18-30 to think about and contribute to a glossary on fluvial landscapes in the form of writing, graphic/art, photographs or other media. The workshop aimed to pay particular attention to the story of the river Kaveri and its profound influence on the ecological, political and socio-cultural landscape of the region. Through the workshop, participants attempted to situate the historical and contemporary realities of Kaveri in the larger technocratic and socio-cultural imagination of river landscapes. <br><br>The outcomes of this workshop, including writings, artworks, photographs, and other media, will be on display. We invite you to come and explore these creative contributions that reflect on the Kaveri River and its evolving landscape.",
