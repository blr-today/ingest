    "description": "How have grasses shaped human civilisation and the ecosystem? <br><br>Grasses are an ancient, diverse and extraordinary group of plants, but most of us rarely give them a second thought.  Join Mahesh Sankaran as he explores how their evolution has transformed Earth in unprecedented ways, and how these amazing life forms impact our lives in ways we don\u2019t realise.  The discussion will conclude by outlining the various dangers that grassland ecosystems are currently experiencing and stressing how vital it is that they be preserved.<br><br>This programme is organised in collaboration with the Infosys Science Foundation.",

    "description": "Have we rewritten the history of the Iron Age? <br><br>Recent Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dates from coastal urn burial sites of Sivagalai and Adichnallur in Tamil Nadu have pushed back the timeline for the early finds of iron. Evidence indicates the use of iron emerged as early as about 3000 BCE, suggesting people and technology could have moved between Tamil Nadu and Harappan sites. In this lecture, archaeometallurgist Sharada Srinivasan will share ongoing research which enables us to rethink the first use of iron from an archaeometallurgical perspective. Using burial urns as a central motif, she will share contemporary theories and evidence to show how these discoveries of iron in Tamil Nadu might reshape our understanding of the emergence of iron and technologies around smelting.",
