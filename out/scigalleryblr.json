    "description": "How much labour goes into your food?\n\nJoin Dayananda Nagaraju for an interactive workshop exploring the physical energy in traditional methods of food preparation. Before machines, tasks like paddy pounding and rice preparation demanded both skill and strength\u2014labour often carried by women who worked as both homemakers and farmers. In this workshop, the artist\u2019s mother will demonstrate these practices and their physical intensity. The workshop bridges culture, science, and health, presenting calories not only as measures of food, but as movements of the body and testimonies of women\u2019s invisible work in sustaining both families and fields.",

    "description": "From planetary diets to vegan diets, various advocates call for a move towards plant-based food as a way to address climate change.  \n\nHowever, a number of questions remain. How does food production relate with climate change? Is going Vegan or Vegetarian the best way ahead? Should we eat locally? Is this a feasible strategy for India? What factors shape our food choices (locally, nationally, and globally) and why do they matter for climate change? \n\nThis workshop will help participants figure out the idea of food choices and climate change by breaking down the various environmental, socio-economic, and climate related factors affecting such choices.",

Sharing insights from his research into how a rich diversity of frogs and toads helps sustain our ecosystems and agricultural landscapes. He will explore their vital role as natural pest controllers and how they could be a powerful antidote to the excessive spraying of pesticides. The talk will also have an interactive component where he will show how a healthy frog population is directly linked to the food we eat through a short game.",

    "description": "Have you ever instantly recognised a face or completely missed one?\n\nFaces are the foundation of human connection, yet our understanding of face perception has been shaped almost entirely by studies on Western populations. India, home to one-sixth of the world\u2019s population, has remained absent from this research despite its immense diversity. Join SP Arun and Vaishnavi Mohite as they introduce the first large-scale project on face perception in India, focused on individuals with extraordinary recognition abilities (super recognisers) and those with severe impairments (prosopagnosia). \n\nThey will discuss the development of the Indian Face Memory Test (IFMT), a tool tailored to the unique features of Indian faces, and standardising clinical protocols for prosopagnosia research in the country. This project not only replicates classic findings such as the face inversion effect across cultures but also asks new questions, such as how contextual cues like clothing, voice, and hairstyle aid recognition when face perception fails. By combining behavioural measures with computational modelling, they aim to uncover both universal and culturally specific principles of face perception.\n",
