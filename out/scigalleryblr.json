    "description": "Can we teach a machine to understand food?\n\nJoin Ganesh Bagler as he explains how the rapid growth of food-related data and advances in artificial intelligence are transforming how we understand the science of gastronomy. Learn about the emerging discipline of computational gastronomy, a field that applies data science and AI to investigate culinary patterns, nutritional structures, and flavour principles. Explore how making food computable is allowing us to decode long-standing culinary mysteries, uncover the links between diet and health, and design innovative food solutions. Discover the implications this holds for public health, personalised nutrition, and sustainable food systems.",

The film journeys through a vintage radio museum curated by a passionate restorer in Bengaluru, revisits the historic 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing commentary from the Voice of America (Tamil Service), and highlights the crucial role of Ham Radio during disasters such as tsunamis. It also traces how a childhood fascination with radio inspired individuals to become popular announcers, celebrates beloved programmes like Binaca Geetmala and cricket commentary, and follows the determined efforts of a retired librarian repairing his cherished radio.\n\nThe film further showcases the exciting revival of School Radio, where students are reimagining the magic of radio in new and innovative ways.\n\n\u201cMy Radio My Life\u201d has been screened at over 80 film festivals across 36 countries, earning multiple awards and nominations for its heartfelt storytelling and cultural significance.\n\nJoin filmmaker Makarand Waikar and Creative Producer Simantinee Bhagwat as they explore the film\u2019s concept, creative journey, and the enduring themes it explores.",
