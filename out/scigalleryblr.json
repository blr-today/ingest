    "description": "Carbon: one word with many hues, shapes, forms and features. Carbon is an essential building block of life. From invisible molecules to giant whales and thousand-year old trees\u2014all life is carbon. In this two-day masterclass, join ecologist Meghna Krishnadas to explore all things carbon and ecology! From the fundamentals of carbon to nature walks, this masterclass will use  interactive, hands-on sessions to understand the ecology of carbon in living beings, and what that means for humans. Come prepared to exercise your [C]reativity!<br><br>Please note that this is a 2-day masterclass which will take place on Saturday and Sunday, 20 and 21 April.",

The body of the logistics worker is the fulcrum upon which global systems of power and trade rest. But it is also a body on which gendered and racialised pressures rest. In this masterclass, Laleh Khalili will draw on her ongoing research and experiences of travelling on cargo ships to explore the life of these labourers. Join us to  investigate an experience riddled with adversities\u2014loneliness, loss, and violence, stolen wages and exploitative logistics businesses\u2014as well as ephemeral moments of joy and solidarity. <br><br>Please note that this is a 2-day masterclass which will take place on Saturday and Sunday, 27 and 28 April.",

What can this kind of practice tell us about public art, which can shape our experiences of the world? Outi Turpeinen and Riikka M\u00e4kikoskela will discuss the fundamentals of these two concepts. Taking examples from Bangalore and other parts of the world, they will show how radical creativity is seen through and in public art.",
