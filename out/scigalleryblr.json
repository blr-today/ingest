    "description": "The River Landscapes workshop was an invitation to students, artists, creative practitioners and early career researchers in the age group 18-30 to think about and contribute to a glossary on fluvial landscapes in the form of writing, graphic/art, photographs or other media. The workshop aimed to pay particular attention to the story of the river Kaveri and its profound influence on the ecological, political and socio-cultural landscape of the region. Through the workshop, participants attempted to situate the historical and contemporary realities of Kaveri in the larger technocratic and socio-cultural imagination of river landscapes. <br><br>The outcomes of this workshop, including writings, artworks, photographs, and other media, will be on display. We invite you to come and explore these creative contributions that reflect on the Kaveri River and its evolving landscape.",

    "description": "How does the transition to parenthood reshape the brain? What do these neurological changes mean for both birthing and non-birthing parents?<br><br>The transition to parenthood, particularly motherhood, involves significant neurological changes throughout pregnancy and into the postpartum period. Recent research has begun to uncover the profound alterations in the maternal brain during this time of matrescence, why they occur and what they mean. Furthermore, these changes are not exclusive to birthing parents\u2014fathers and adoptive parents experience similar brain adaptations. Join Jodi Pawluski as she explores the key transformations in the brain during the transition to parenthood.",
