Visual artist Arunkumar H G certainly thinks so! In this workshop he delves into the origins and historical contexts of materials, while they transform from resources to waste. <br><br>For this workshop, you are encouraged to bring your own accumulation of waste, to examine how we perceive and interpret waste. You will then work with Arunkumar H G to transform these materials into art objects, highlighting the qualities and significance of the seemingly mundane.",
