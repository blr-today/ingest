    "description": "In today\u2019s world, the truth is defined by facts, and facts are strengthened by data. Nowadays, storytelling has moved on from just its fictional form to data-based narratives. Not only verbal or written ones but visual stories weave a more compelling picture for people. Tangible proof holds an even higher value in the viewer\u2019s eyes.<br><br>In this workshop, the Information Design students from the National Institute of Design (NID) Bangalore will guide participants through the process of making physical data visualizations that tell stories and make a true statement. They will take a deep dive into the UN Sustainable Development Goals and their significance in the present day.<br><br>This session will take you through their work revolving around the SDGs and give you an insight into their process of data physicalization, coupled with a hands-on exercise to learn and try the same for yourself.<br><br>",
