    "description": "Join Suhas Ganesh and Rakshathi Basavaraju from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in two short talks followed by an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on mental health.<br><br>1) When something is wrong with the body, the mind recognises the change and motivates us to action. When things start going wrong with the mind itself, what happens? In this public lecture, Suhas Ganesh will explore the myriad maladies of the mind and how our mind detects or fails to detect, a change within itself. He also looks at mental health through the lens of genetics. He explores the interplay between genes, experiences and the environment and their effect on the mind.<br><br>2) Mental health conditions can be of a multitude of types. The way each individual experiences mental health conditions is also diverse. It is no surprise then that there exist a plethora of treatments in psychiatry. One such treatment is the electric and magnetic stimulation of the brain. In this lecture, Rakshathi Basavaraju offers a glimpse into the types of electromagnetic stimulation in psychiatry, the conditions they treat and their safety.",
