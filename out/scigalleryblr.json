    "description": "How is novel research in medicine redefining our process of diagnosing and treating diseases? Join biologist Kshitish K Acharya as he takes us through current research which attempts to quantify and characterise biological molecules. Taking the example of specific diseases, Acharya will describe and contextualise the process of biological research in identifying 'biomarkers.' Biomarkers are molecules which are strongly associated with a specific biological event. These biomarkers help predict onset of disease (diagnostics), its progress (prognostics) and monitoring, as well as drug development (therapeutics)\u2014including \u2018personalized medicine\u2019. Cutting-edge technologies today have enabled screening an entire set of molecules in a single experiment. Join us to discover the research processes and technological advancements that are shaping modern medicine today.  <br><br>This lecture will be conducted in Kannada.",
