An adivasi woman’s concern over the disappearance of medicinal plants from the forest, a local farmer’s commitment to growing traditional varieties of rice organically and a cash crop cultivator’s struggle to survive amidst farmers’ suicides, offer fresh insights into shifting relations between people, their knowledge systems and environment. Interwoven into these contemporary narratives is an ancient tribal creation myth that traces the passage of their ancestors across this land, recalling past ways of reading and mapping the terrain. As hills flatten, forests disappear and traditional knowledge systems are forgotten, the film reminds us that this diversity could disappear forever, to be replaced by monotonous and unsustainable alternatives.<br><br>Join us for a discussion between ecologist Samira Agnihotri and filmmaker Sunanda Bhat as they discuss the film and delve into the profound effects of a rapidly changing landscape on people's lives and livelihoods.",

In this talk, ecologist Jayashree Ratnam will first unpack the historical and geographical reasons for this misperception. She will then present evidence, to the contrary, that these ecosystems are ancient, biodiverse, culturally rich and highly productive. While they have historically been diverted for agriculture and industry, today, ironically, they are threatened by climate change mitigation initiatives such as green energy and tree planting. They are urgently in need of conservation and restoration action that explicitly values them for their uniqueness and distinct functional ecologies.",

    "blurb": "One of humanity’s oldest connections with nature is centred around food. This relationship has shaped identities and cultures across time and space. For India’s small-scale fishing communities, their relationship with coastal and marine ecosystems is critical to their lives, livelihoods, and overall well being. However, while coexistence was the norm, today they are faced with mounting challenges and multiple insecurities. How do we safeguard coexistence in such land and seascapes? This talk will explore the ways in which coexistence was and is woven into fisher communities, the challenges of today and a shared conservation philosophy that should guide our path forward. ",

Today, it allows people to directly contribute primary biodiversity data while also encouraging citizen science engagement. <br><br>The Coexistence Project is a significant endeavour that reflects the portal's dedication to not only addressing the issues of conservation in a human-dominated landscape but also responding to the need for more complex information that reveals patterns and relationships within an ecosystem. This talk will explore the portal and the project in tandem, to think about the coexistence dynamics between biodiversity and human activities by capturing intricate aspects of species attributes, habitat characteristics, and ecological interactions. <br><br>As cities such as Bengaluru undergo rapid urbanisation, the resulting habitat and biodiversity loss pose challenges for coexistence. Documenting incidents of this interaction in a structured manner becomes imperative for effective conservation strategies and urban planning that foster harmonious cohabitation.",
