    "description": "How can knowledge be passed down through a seed?\n\nJoin Arunkumar HG and Dayananda Nagaraju, exhibiting artists of CALORIE, as they explore their exhibits in detail.\n\nLearn about the Akshatha Seedbank with Arunkumar as he shares how it became the foundation of the exhibit Vulnerable Guardians. Discover how this collection of seeds is a living archive of resilience, biodiversity, and cultural memory. Arunkumar will further dive into the ties between farmers, landscapes and seeds, while reflecting on how a seedbank can be a container of knowledge and wisdom from those who came before.\n\nDayananda will reflect on the artistic process behind his exhibit, Atantraru & The Golden Seed. He reflects on how a thought begins like a seed\u2014small, invisible, and full of potential\u2014and how it finds its way into expression through his artistic practice. Dayananda explores the ecology of creativity, the conditions that allow ideas to germinate, the fragility and resilience of expression, and the collective fields in which thoughts grow. Come and learn how an artwork - just like a seed - can carry memory and possibility!",

    "description": "Sugar is a material full of contrasts, a sweet delight and a forbidden indulgence. Inspired by artist Jade Armstrong\u2019s original concept, this workshop explores the delicate balance between beauty, sweetness, and the fleeting nature of life.\n\nIn this workshop, Chef Pratyay will guide the participants to learn and to create intricate sugar-blown sculptures, each capturing a single breath and symbolising both the passage of time and the fragility of life. As these sculptures slowly melt into syrupy residue, they reflect sugar\u2019s transformation from a prized luxury to an overconsumed treat.\n\nThis hands-on experience encourages reflection on desire, decay, and consumption.",
