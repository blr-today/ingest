    "description": "How do we examine pollution of water and soil through a scientific lens? How can monitoring pollution levels help address urban challenges?<br><br>Join Priyanka Jamwal and her team at the Water and Soil laboratory at the Ashoka Trust For Research In Ecology And The Environment (ATREE). We will explore the scientific methods used to monitor and analyse water and soil pollution. Participants will tour the lab and learn how data on pollution is collected, processed, and used to tackle environmental problems. The visit will also demonstrate how this data is applied to plan, design, and evaluate solutions aimed at improving water and soil quality.",

Join biologist Kshitish K Acharya as he takes us through current research which attempts to quantify and characterise biological molecules. Taking the example of specific diseases, Acharya will describe and contextualise the process of biological research in identifying 'biomarkers.' Biomarkers are molecules which are strongly associated with a specific biological event. These biomarkers help predict onset of disease (diagnostics), its progress (prognostics) and monitoring, as well as drug development (therapeutics)\u2014including \u2018personalized medicine\u2019. Cutting-edge technologies today have enabled screening an entire set of molecules in a single experiment.
