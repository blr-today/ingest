    "description": "How might we democratise tools to represent and have conversations about data? How can we welcome personal data stories and why are they important? In this hands-on workshop, participants will explore the concept of data through the lens of everyday household objects. By encoding personal stories and experiences into these items, we aim to highlight how individual narratives reflect broader societal realities. Participants will learn simple techniques to transform familiar objects into data carriers, fostering a deeper understanding of personal and collective data stories. Join us to engage in meaningful conversations about data's role in our lives and how we can make it more accessible and relatable.",

    "description": "In today\u2019s world, the truth is defined by facts, and facts are strengthened by data. Nowadays, storytelling has moved on from just its fictional form to data-based narratives. Not only verbal or written ones but visual stories weave a more compelling picture for people. Tangible proof holds an even higher value in the viewer\u2019s eyes.<br><br>In this workshop, the Information Design students from the National Institute of Design (NID) Bangalore will guide participants through the process of making physical data visualizations that tell stories and make a true statement. They will take a deep dive into the UN Sustainable Development Goals and their significance in the present day.<br><br>This session will take you through their work revolving around the SDGs and give you an insight into their process of data physicalization, coupled with a hands-on exercise to learn and try the same for yourself.<br>",
