    "description": "Wistful Sunday mornings over chai and biscuits listening to the pattering of rain.\nRoasted rotis and sharing fragrant curries around a dining table.\nGoldeny sweet jalebes that capture the rich lights of festivals. Memories of food is more than its taste.\n\nJoin us on a walkthrough of Calorie where we explore food as nostalgia! Through art, stories, and interactive moments, we will explore the meals we once ignored, the flavors we miss the most, and the small rituals that quietly shaped us.\n\nCome for the stories, stay to colour.",

    "description": "Have you ever been to a leftovers potluck? \n\nLed by Ritaban Ghosh, this potluck examines whether hygiene and edibility are shaped by our beliefs and habits that we inherit, choose, or find difficult to leave behind. Is disgust a property of things, or an emotion that shapes moral codes? Is food (or waste) often a matter of attitude?\n\nWhether it\u2019s pasta from a sunday brunch or rasam from the time you caught a cold. The older, the better. Plates will be exchanged and passed around after every bite. Eating in relay, we\u2019ll pause at different stages of the food\u2019s life, before it becomes waste, or perhaps doesn\u2019t at all.\n\nLearn how to turn leftovers into consumable capsules and create a mind map on where edibility is withdrawn, how habits are reciprocal, and when refusal becomes aesthetic.\n\nParticipants are invited to bring leftovers. \n",

    "description": "Sunday mornings often begin with a peek into the fridge with wilted greens, sprouting spuds and a questionable stench, followed by the question: to eat or not to eat? Deciding what to consume and what to discard is a perennial struggle. In doing so, we enter uneasy intimacies shaped by affordance, access and surplus. \n\nIn this talk, Ritaban Ghosh examines food and waste, asking: where does the boundary between purity and contamination lie? What truly determines edibility? He traces the processes through which food comes to be classified as waste, while moving across the globe, where repurposed food becomes sustenance. From Mexico\u2019s *Huitlacoche*, a regional corn fungus delicacy, to Indonesia\u2019s *Kopi luwak*, coffee beans collected from Civet excrement, food is far more complex than we often assume.",
