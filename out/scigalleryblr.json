    "description": "As humans, we have an intrinsic need to understand the world around us. We have evolved from crafting simple tools to mastering technologies with the potential to reshape the planet. We invented language, deconstructed planetary motion and split the atom. Through the ages, we have built better and sophisticated tools that let us expand the range of what we can perceive, letting us \u2018sense\u2019 beyond the limits of biology.<br>In this walkthrough, mediators Jagrut Amuri and Vignesh K use the current exhibition season Sci560 as an anchor to explore how we use senses to understand our world and the role that science plays in deepening this understanding.<br>",
