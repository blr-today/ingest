    "description": "This workshop, a sequel to the one on 'Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth: Planning for Bengaluru', is about 'mechanism design', towards accomplishing shared-desirable outcomes for the city. How can urban planning processes negotiate and reconcile competing demands of an amplified set of stakeholders who are often mis-aligned in their values and goals? In this workshop, Champaka Rajagopal will explore mechanism design which incorporates incentives and penalties for stakeholders to partner, behave and transact in ways that contribute to the accomplishment of shared outcomes. Drawing on existing practices and models, we will creatively craft multiple partnership arrangements among stakeholders with competing interests at different scales of decisions, in our endeavor for meeting shared desirable outcomes for Bengaluru.",

As ambitious as they are, they are not new. The early years of newly decolonized India, much like many other nascent nations across Asia and Africa, embraced self-reliance as a way of achieving economic and political independence from imperial powers.<br>A number of these technological and industrial projects were located in the city of Bengaluru, making it a true city of Science and Technology. At different points these projects enrolled key actors, from the model citizen-worker to the \u2018tech entrepreneur\u2019.
