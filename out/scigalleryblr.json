    "description": "For the past few decades, human activity has left an indelible mark on the Earth, leading to the proposed geological epoch called the Anthropocene. Though there is still debate on when the Anthropocene has started, in the midst of the climate crisis, there is an urgent call to acknowledge our lasting influence on the planet.<br>Join mediators Fathima Aslaha and Gaayatri Chandrasekharan as they explore the Anthropocene through the lens of Bengaluru\u2014a city where nature perseveres amidst the pressures of rapid urbanisation. Using the Sci560 exhibition season as an anchor, they ask what a sustainable future in the city looks like.",

    "description": "Have we rewritten the history of the Iron Age? <br><br>Recent Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dates from coastal urn burial sites of Sivagalai and Adichnallur in Tamil Nadu have pushed back the timeline for the early finds of iron. Evidence indicates the use of iron emerged as early as about 3000 BCE, suggesting people and technology could have moved between Tamil Nadu and Harappan sites. In this lecture, archaeometallurgist Sharada Srinivasan will share ongoing research which enables us to rethink the first use of iron from an archaeometallurgical perspective. Using burial urns as a central motif, she will share contemporary theories and evidence to show how these discoveries of iron in Tamil Nadu might reshape our understanding of the emergence of iron and technologies around smelting.",
