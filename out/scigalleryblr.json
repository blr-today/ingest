    "description": "How have grasses shaped human civilisation and the ecosystem? <br><br>Grasses are an ancient, diverse and extraordinary group of plants, but most of us rarely give them a second thought.  Join Mahesh Sankaran as he explores how their evolution has transformed Earth in unprecedented ways, and how these amazing life forms impact our lives in ways we don\u2019t realise.  The discussion will conclude by outlining the various dangers that grassland ecosystems are currently experiencing and stressing how vital it is that they be preserved.<br><br>This programme is organised in collaboration with the Infosys Science Foundation.",

The title takes its name from two intertwined ideas, the \u2018rehearsal\u2019 and \u2018duality\u2019 or that which is shaped by the quality of \u2018two\u2019. Building on projects centered on chronology and observation, they will explore the format of a staging to frame working methodologies created by the intersections, collisions and amplification of individual thinking.",

As rural worlds become disembedded and de-agrarianisation takes hold, what gets left behind?

Today, there is a lot of  speculation around technology, especially data science. <br>However, is data science still festering older biases? How much can we trust the solutions provided? How dependent are we becoming on data science? <br><br>While it is true that data science can solve challenging problems, concerns remain that it is equally vulnerable to arriving at erroneous conclusions and can be subjected to methodological abuse. <br><br>Join Jayant Harista for a thought provoking lecture pushing the conversation around data science in the contemporary world.<br><br>This programme is in collaboration with Infosys Science Foundation.",
