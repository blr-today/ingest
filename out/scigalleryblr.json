    "description": "How has living through a pandemic reshaped our understanding of the history of contagion and the broader discipline of the history of medicine? Join Flurin Condrau as he examines the profound impact of the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Condrau will explore how the experience of living through a pandemic shifts historical perspectives on infection. <br><br>The pandemic has not only created new avenues for public engagement but also inspired profound reconsideration of the purpose and scope of medical history.<br> Come be a part of this thought-provoking lecture and gain fresh insights into the ways global health crises reshape our understanding of disease, society, and the role of history in public health.",

But, at first sight, black holes seem to defy<br>this principle. It appears that quantum fluctuations could cause a black<br>hole to 'shred' whatever information falls into it.

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what mathematicians really do? How their work uncovers hidden patterns, solves intricate puzzles, and drives advancements in fields like computer science and materials research? Join Disha Kuzhively to explore answers to these questions through the art of tiling. <br><br>Tiling is the fascinating art of covering a surface with geometric shapes that fit together seamlessly, leaving no gaps or overlaps. Most tiles we encounter\u2014like those in kitchens or bathrooms\u2014form periodic, repeating patterns. But what happens when we break away from repetition? Can a surface be tiled aperiodically? How many unique tile shapes are needed for this? Discover the answers and the beauty of mathematics with Disha Kuzhively!",

    "description": "There is growing recognition of the need to teach about artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) at the school level in light of the meteoric growth in the range and diversity of application of machine learning (ML) in all industries and everyday consumer products, with Large Language Models (LLMs) being only the latest and most compelling example yet. Efforts to bring AI, especially ML education to school learners are being propelled by substantial industry interest as well as technological developments that make AI tools readily available to learners of all ages. These efforts span a variety of learning goals including developing a foundational AI literacy as well as AI concepts as a part of computer science curricula, aimed at developing students' understanding of AI and machine learning as well as AI ethics.<br><br>Join Shuchi Grover in a talk where she shares insights from research on helping students develop competencies to navigate the future in the age of AI.
