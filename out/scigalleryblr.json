    "description": "Over the past 12 months, our Mediators have engaged with Sci560 in ways perhaps no one else has had the opportunity to, and have donned many hats in the gallery. Out of this close relationship, comes rich experience that touches every nook and cranny of life. So much to say, our mediator showcase for the Sci560 exhibition-season is to delve into some of that experience, through the thoughtful and engaging segments curated by our mediators.",

    "description": "In this workshop, we will explore the Sci560 Exhibition and talk about language in the background of electoral politics, astronomy, technology, education, and big-problems of the age like climate change. And like nachos goes with salsa, we will gently flex our lingual muscles with activities around reading, writing, translating, zine-making, and discussions. What stories can emerge when we see as enthusiasts of language may? Can our relationship with science be any better if we softly inch towards comfort with language itself? Let us cut through the noisy rule-making and propriety around language, and gently explore the intersections of language and science.<br>Join mediator Vignesh for this exhibition walkthrough-cum-workshop to explore new possibilities with science on the avenue of language.",
