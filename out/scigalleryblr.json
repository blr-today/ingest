    "description": "How does a city influence its own climate and, how can we see it happen in real time? As Indian cities like Bengaluru expand, climate challenges like the heat island effect, flooding, and stresses on infrastructure are becoming impossible to ignore. Join CSTEP in a Masterclass that explores the fast-evolving field of urban climate research, using geospatial technologies to track and understand how cities interact with their environments. With Bengaluru as a case study, come examine how remote sensing and open-source tools like Google Earth Engine help map, measure, and respond to climate variability. From satellite data to street-level insights, join to learn how cities shape weather\u2014and how we can shape better cities.",
