    "description": "How has parenting teens changed in the digital age?\n\nJoin us for the launch of the Penguin-published book \u2018Resilience Decoded: What every parent should know about teen mental health\u2019 by Sujata Kelkar Shetty. Learn how in a digital age, teens are now growing up in a storm of stimulation \u2013 endless notifications, academic pressure, curated perfection, and connection that often feels more isolating than real. Understand why teens seem impulsive or unreachable and how to manage digital overwhelm, burnout, and the long-reaching effects of pandemic-era isolation. Drawing from her experience in neuroscience and years of stress research at the National Institutes of Health, Dr Shetty provides a compassionate guide to understanding the adolescent brain without reducing adolescence to simply a problem that needs to be solved.",
