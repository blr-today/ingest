    "description": "Public engagement plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between academia, science, and society, transforming specialised knowledge into accessible narratives that inspire and inform. This discussion brings together Marcus du Sautoy and Jahnavi Phalkey, to explore the transformative power of public engagement. Together, they will unpack  fundamental questions: What problems does public engagement address? Why do we pursue it? How can we measure its success? And most importantly, how can we do it better? By reflecting on their own experiences and examining innovative strategies, they aim to spark a dialogue about making knowledge more inclusive and impactful.",
