    "description": "Sugar is a material full of contrasts, a sweet delight and a forbidden indulgence. Inspired by artist Jade Armstrong\u2019s original concept, this workshop explores the delicate balance between beauty, sweetness, and the fleeting nature of life.\n\nIn this workshop, Chef Pratyay will guide the participants to learn and to create intricate sugar-blown sculptures, each capturing a single breath and symbolising both the passage of time and the fragility of life. As these sculptures slowly melt into syrupy residue, they reflect sugar\u2019s transformation from a prized luxury to an overconsumed treat.\n\nThis hands-on experience encourages reflection on desire, decay, and consumption.",

    "description": "Ever wonder what predatory birds feed on? \n\nJoin Arjun Kannan, as he unravels the dietary secrets of Harriers - a migratory bird of prey. Harriers are long distance migrants that come to the dry grasslands of India during the months of August to March. They travel thousands of kilometres from their breeding grounds in Central Asia to spend the winter in India, catching diverse kinds of prey. Through long term research, Arjun has tried to decode what they eat and whether their diet shifts between the regions and seasons within India. Learn how Harriers contribute to ecosystem services by forming vital links in the fragmented grassland habitats of India.",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what food security looks like in Indian cities?\n\nWhile urban conversations often focus on cutting carbs, counting calories, and following the latest diet trends, a very different story unfolds among the millions of low-skilled migrant workers who keep these cities running. Join Chetan Choithani as he explores the hidden face of urban food insecurity through the experiences of nearly 600 labour migrants in Bengaluru. Many of these workers leave their villages in search of better livelihoods, only to find themselves in precarious informal jobs that force them to compromise on their own nutrition\u2014skipping meals, eating poorly, and sometimes going hungry. Through their stories, this lecture reveals how India\u2019s food insecurity challenge is shifting\u2014from being largely rural to becoming an increasingly urban concern.",

How big can a system get before it stops behaving quantum mechanically and hews to theories of classical physics? Does nature have a quantum-classical boundary?. Explore the prize winners work in showing quantum mechanical tunneling and other quantum effects in macroscopic electrical circuits, suggesting that quantum theory remains applicable as objects get bigger. Anil will discuss the work that won the Nobel Prize, how it pushed the quantum-classical boundary beyond previously known limits, and the implications for technologies such as quantum computers.\n\nThe lecture will be followed by a panel discussion on Quantum Mechanics with Arindam Ghosh and Shobhana Narasimhan.",

Built from the coordination driven assembly of metal ions or clusters with organic linkers, MOFs embody the concept of reticular chemistry. Join Tapas K. Maji as he traces the journey of MOFs\u2014from the pioneering discoveries by Professors Robson, Kitagawa, and Yaghi, to their roles in addressing global challenges such as CO 2 capture and conversion, green hydrogen production, water harvesting and purification, and targeted drug delivery. Having had the privilege of working as a postdoctoral researcher with one of the laureates -Prof. Susumu Kitagawa (Kyoto University, Japan) - during the formative years of MOF research (2002\u20132005) Tapas will share insights from his work in the laureates laboratory. The talk will highlight how the MOF community\u2019s collective efforts have shaped a new paradigm in porous materials chemistry, integrating functionality, adaptability, and aesthetics at the molecular level and beyond.\n",

And we realise that across the planet, all humans have the same hopes and fears, the same desires and anxieties. More than any other discipline, literature demonstrates and celebrates our common humanity. The number of literary prizes has grown rapidly in the last few decades, especially prizes for a single book. Where have these prizes come from and whom do they go to? How do they impact books sales and impact the publishing industry? Literary prizes have political, aesthetic and commercial dimensions \u2013 how do these factors determine the literary landscape for readers like you and me?",
