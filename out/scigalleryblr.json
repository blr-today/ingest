    "description": "What do the landscape markers of Bangalore reveal about its people and their relationship with nature? <br><br>The territory of Bangalore is a complex composition of rocky outcrops, high grounds, flat lands and valleys. The process of occupation is premised on the idea of effective management of water and its associated infrastructure \u2013 both manmade and natural. The natural capacity of the land finds varied expressions in human use \u2013 from settlements to sacred groves, from seasonal and perennial agriculture to grasslands. Join Dr. Mohan Rao as he unpacks the complex mosaic of Bangalore\u2019s landscape, where markers of culture and belief\u2014both sacred and everyday\u2014are deeply embedded. These layered terrains can be seen as \u2018watermarked\u2019 by human interaction, creating a powerful sense of place, belonging, and identity, and reflecting a longstanding relationship between society and nature.<br><br>This programme is in collaboration with Integrated Design.",

They transcend the urban and the rural and have become integral in today's environmental discourse. Join Amit Kurien and Rahul Paul as they unpack idea of the commons through engagement with private and state property, open access resources and the process of \u201ccommoning\u201d. Explore why in this day and age why thinking about land, water, air - rural and urban - and even digital spaces such as the internet commons from the perspective of commons is integral if citizens are to take back control over resources that rightfully belong to them and to prevent exploitation in the current neoliberal world order.<br><br>This programme is in collaboration with Integrated Design.",
