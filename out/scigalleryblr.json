    "description": "What does \u2018material\u2019 or \u2018medium\u2019 mean to an artist? Do materials themselves provide rich narratives and social histories? Visual artist Arunkumar H G certainly thinks so! In this workshop he delves into the origins and historical contexts of materials, while they transform from resources to waste. <br><br>For this workshop, you are encouraged to bring your own accumulation of waste, to examine how we perceive and interpret waste. You will then work with Arunkumar H G to transform these materials into art objects, highlighting the qualities and significance of the seemingly mundane.",

    "description": "How do we make sense of \u2018invasive\u2019 species? What are the complexities they bring to different ecosystems? And do <i>Homo sapiens </i>also act as an invasive species?<br><br><i>Lantana camara </i>was introduced into India by the British in the early 1800s and was subsequently discovered to be one of the world\u2019s most invasive species. <i>Lantana camara</i> lurks in the background as a character in this play, set in the forests of South India. The behaviour of floral invasive species has parallels with that of human invaders and <i>The Clearing</i> is a play about invasions, intended or otherwise. <br><br>Join us to witness the reading of the play, presented by the production company of Jagriti Theatre. <br><br><i>The Clearing</i> is based on scientific input from Dr Suhel Qader of the Nature Conservation Foundation, on information from the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) and on the invaluable stories from the Soliga people of B.R. Hills, Karnataka, India.<br><br><i>The Clearing </i>was produced by Mallya Aditi International School as part of their 25th Anniversary celebrations and as part of the Theatrescience India project, originally supported by the Wellcome Trust, UK and NCBS, in particular Dr Mukund Thattai.",
