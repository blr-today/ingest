This visit will be an opportunity to see how scientists collect, preserve, and study specimens that help us understand the story of our planet\u2019s biodiversity. From pressed plants and drawers full of insects to preserved bird specimens, every item offers clues about biodiversity, evolution, and environmental change. Participants will also learn how these collections support research, education, and conservation, and hear the stories behind them.<br><br>",

From its origins in Bengaluru all the way to the heights of the Himalayas. The talk will touch upon some of the most famous surveyors in the GTS including William Lambton and George Everest. Exploring why exactly these surveyors had to tramp across the country, braving wild beasts, monsoons, and disease in their quest for inch-perfect maps? It will also speak about some of the forgotten Indians who were a part of this extraordinary work. <br>",

    "description": "This workshop, a sequel to the one on 'Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth: Planning for Bengaluru', is about 'mechanism design', towards accomplishing shared-desirable outcomes for the city. How can urban planning processes negotiate and reconcile competing demands of an amplified set of stakeholders who are often mis-aligned in their values and goals? In this workshop, Champaka Rajagopal will explore mechanism design which incorporates incentives and penalties for stakeholders to partner, behave and transact in ways that contribute to the accomplishment of shared outcomes. Drawing on existing practices and models, we will creatively craft multiple partnership arrangements among stakeholders with competing interests at different scales of decisions, in our endeavor for meeting shared desirable outcomes for Bengaluru.",
