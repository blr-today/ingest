    "description": "On September 1, 1950, at the dawn of the Cold War, Italian physicist Bruno Pontecorvo and his family mysteriously disappeared, creating a political earthquake in Europe and the USA. Pontecorvo was globally known for his expertise in the sensitive field of nuclear research. His disappearance became one of the most fascinating mysteries of the atomic era, especially after it was revealed he had crossed the Iron Curtain to the Soviet Union. Closely tied to 20th-century history and particle physics, he made exceptional contributions to our understanding of the neutrino.\n\nJoin us for a screening of this compelling film, followed by a discussion with the writer, Giuseppe Mussardo, as he explores the life and legacy of Bruno Pontecorvo.",

Through a collective and experimental approach, the workshop seeks to make participants reflect on the ecological, political, and social traces left by the palm oil industry\u2014traces that often remain invisible in our daily lives.\n\nPalm oil\u2014usually hidden within consumer goods\u2014is made visible in its raw, viscous form. As an artistic medium, carrying the weight of exploited bodies, scorched land, and transformed landscapes. Together, participants will construct a mural as a form of visual storytelling: not just aesthetic, but a material testimony to the extractive violence embedded in the global palm oil economy\n",
