    "description": "Have you ever thought of our lives being bound by cycles? From the grand loop of the food chain to the economic flow, everything follows a cycle. But what about the cycles we don\u2019t talk about? Isn\u2019t it soul-stirring to pause and notice these cycles that have influenced us today?<br><br>Join our mediator, Manjuvarshini, who will tell us tales from political to academic cycles in the past. Come along and explore the cycle of success and failure in experimentation, conservation, and administration through the Sci560 exhibition season.",

    "description": "How do astronauts stay fit, nourished, and safe during months in space?<br><br>Join Dr. Brigitte Godard as she takes us behind the scenes of astronaut care. Drawing on nearly two decades of experience, including her current work at the European Astronaut Centre, Dr. Godard unpacks the physiological and nutritional challenges of long-duration spaceflight from bone loss and disrupted sleep cycles to changes in gut microbiota, radiation exposure, and appetite shifts. Through ground-based studies like bed rest experiments and in-flight monitoring, she offers a compelling glimpse into the science that keeps humans healthy beyond Earth.",
