    "description": "How are people\u2019s online and offline lives connected? How do people navigate the space between the digital and the analogue, especially in the context of oppression? \n\nJoin Claire Crawford in a public lecture as she examines these questions from her forthcoming book, \u2018Tethered\u2019. The book combines ethnographic engagement with social movements and postcolonial ideas to understand why history and place matter. In the book she introduces \u2018tethering\u2019 as a simple way to recognise how digital change depends on context. The project addresses a \u2018blind spot\u2019 where many theories about digital change ignore differences between people and individual choice.",

    "description": "What are the fundamental ideas of quantum theory?\n\nJoin Kasia Rejzner for a talk on the basic ideas of quantum theory, starting with quantum mechanics and touching upon concepts in quantum gravity. Taking seriously the idea that our world is fundamentally quantum, rethink concepts like space and time. Understanding them as quantum objects. Learn what it means to measure distance with a quantum ruler and time with a quantum clock. Which leads to the idea of a quantum reference frame,\" which is currently at the centre of a very active area of research.",

    "description": "Eat, Read, Think is a reading circle run by Science Gallery Bengaluru, bringing together curious minds to explore ideas through literature and conversation. Readings will be themed around the current exhibition season, CALORIE, exploring humanity's fraught and intimate relationship with food through readings inspired by the many exhibits present throughout the gallery. Eat, Read, Think welcomes young people from all walks of life to gather for conversations that connect science, culture and society.\n\nFor the fourth session of the reading circle, we will be reading excerpts from the book 'Palm Oil: The Grease of Empire' by Max Haiven",

    "description": "Science and play aren\u2019t supposed to mix, apparently, like oil and water. What if our gallery proves otherwise?\n\nUsing Science Gallery\u2019s CALORIE exhibition as our playground, we\u2019ll turn spaces, objects, and information into rules, challenges, and stories for site-based games. Swapnesh Samaiya, Game Designer and Researcher at the National Institute of Design, invites participants to engage with exhibits through play. Together, we'll explore how play can transform the way we experience public spaces.\n\nThis workshop requires no prior experience in games or design. ",

    "description": "Wistful Sunday mornings over chai and biscuits listening to the pattering of rain.\nRoasted rotis and sharing fragrant curries around a dining table.\nGoldeny sweet jalebes that capture the rich lights of festivals. Memories of food is more than its taste.\n\nJoin us on a walkthrough of Calorie where we explore food as nostalgia! Through art, stories, and interactive moments, we will explore the meals we once ignored, the flavors we miss the most, and the small rituals that quietly shaped us.\n\nCome for the stories, stay to colour.",
