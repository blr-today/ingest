      "description": "(Yasujirō Ozu, 1969, 94min)\n\nA lighthearted take on director Yasujiro Ozu’s perennial theme of the\nchallenges of inter­generational relationships, Good Morning tells the story\nof two young boys who stop speaking in protest after their parents refuse to\nbuy a television set. Ozu weaves a wealth of subtle gags through a family\nportrait as rich as those of his dramatic films, mocking the foibles of the\nadult world through the eyes of his child protagonists. Shot in stunning color\nand set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new\nwashing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door\nsalesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I Was Born,\nBut . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan.\n\n",
