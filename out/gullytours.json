    "description": "In this walk, we will explore how the British sahibs, memsahibs, and royalty left their mark on the garden city.What makes this tour specialWe will start at Cubbon Park, soaking in the freshness in the avenue of trees. Inside the park, we will explore parts that house statues, offices of importance, and landmarks that put Bangalore on the world map. Not to forget, the role of Mark Cubbon in shaping the city, and why the park was named after him.\n\nOnce we\u2019re done with this, we will visit a secret garden as well as stroll along St. Mark\u2019s Road to discover Winston Churchill\u2019s life in the area, and end it with breakfast at an iconic eatery.\n\nBangalore mornings are arguably the best, and we promise to make the walk a memorable one for you with all the area has to offer. All you have to do is join us on the crawl.You can add your images, videos and itinerary route in lightbox for each itinerary as shown below, simply by changing the src path of each media.The Colonial Crawl is a taste of history hidden right under your noses. In this walk, we will explore how the British sahibs, memsahibs, and royalty left their mark on the garden city.\n\nThe English influence on the sprawling Cubbon park, the origins of the Cantonment area, and the surrounding architecture are testimony to a lot of events in history. For example, the American War of Independence, the Battle of Waterloo, and the French Revolution had a connection to this region. We will spill more of this tea when you walk with us.\n Whether you are visiting or you are a local, we promise you will see the city in a different light once you learn about the colonial influence on its churches, clubs, parks, and its people.\n\nCubbon mornings are a sight to sore eyes, and the perfect time to discover the Colonial Hangover in one of the older parts of the city.",

This South Bangalore trail also takes you on a nostalgia tour of Bangalore in the 60s and 70s, which was the land of playwrights, artists, and authors.\n\nThe eateries where these greats hung out still exist and serve their humble fare to crowds even today, some of whom still serve the same dishes since their inception. But this trail is not just about food. It lets you explore and understand what city planning, local bazaars, and vintage charms feels like.",

It\u2019s a melting pot of cultures built together by the locals, immigrants, and the British. In Cantt by night, we will be exploring the lesser-known side of Commercial street, which goes beyond the regular street shopping fare. There are houses, shops, institutions and more that carry the legacy of leaders and prominent names in Bangalore\u2019s history. And of course, no legacy is complete without the presence of food. From a family-run dosa joint to a 48-year-old sweet shop and a legacy bakery, there\u2019s a brilliant food mix on the menu as you explore the ruins and reigns of one of Bangalore\u2019s most popular shopping districts.",
