The Malleswaram Hogona (Eng: Let\u2019s go to Malleswaram) street art project wants to make streets safer for women. Conceived by the Bengaluru moving project, this street art walk is an initiative to make neighbourhoods safe, friendly, and full of character.\n Apart from being one of the oldest planned neighbourhoods in the city, it houses a flower market, many institutions and lanes adorned with trees. Each work of art tells you the artist\u2019s inspiration and their connection to the landscape, and we\u2019d love to host you here.\n Let\u2019s go to Malleswaram to witness modern day murals painted on old world lanes, starting with a legendary breakfast at CTR.",
