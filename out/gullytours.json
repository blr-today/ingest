There are houses, shops, institutions and more that carry the legacy of leaders and prominent names in Bangalore\u2019s history. And of course, no legacy is complete without the presence of food. From a family-run dosa joint to a 48-year-old sweet shop and a legacy bakery, there\u2019s a brilliant food mix on the menu as you explore the ruins and reigns of one of Bangalore\u2019s most popular shopping districts.",
