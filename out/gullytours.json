We\u2019ll then venture into different streets and explore old houses in the neighbourhood, visit hotels and cafes that are always ready to serve hot fare in windy, cold evenings of Bangalore.\n\nWe will discover why the menu at these places hasn\u2019t changed in decades, what are some of their best-selling dishes, and uncover some of the lesser-known secrets of the city\u2019s history\n\nThis is a walk for anyone who loves to explore the sleepy, yet vibrant side of Bangalore.You can add your images, videos and itinerary route in lightbox for each itinerary as shown below, simply by changing the src path of each media.The trend of tiffins is unique to Bangalore. A local snack soiree that began in the bylanes of Basavanagudi is now quintessential to the Bangalore lifestyle.\n\nIn the tiffin trail, we explore how this story began, people who brought in the tiffin concept and what makes these eateries so special. This South Bangalore trail also takes you on a nostalgia tour of Bangalore in the 60s and 70s, which was the land of playwrights, artists, and authors.\n\nThe eateries where these greats hung out still exist and serve their humble fare to crowds even today, some of whom still serve the same dishes since their inception. But this trail is not just about food. It lets you explore and understand what city planning, local bazaars, and vintage charms feels like.",
