In this walk, we will explore how the British sahibs, memsahibs, and royalty left their mark on the garden city.\n\nThe English influence on the sprawling Cubbon park, the origins of the Cantonment area, and the surrounding architecture are testimony to a lot of events in history. For example, the American War of Independence, the Battle of Waterloo, and the French Revolution had a connection to this region. We will spill more of this tea when you walk with us.\n Whether you are visiting or you are a local, we promise you will see the city in a different light once you learn about the colonial influence on its churches, clubs, parks, and its people.\n\nCubbon mornings are a sight to sore eyes, and the perfect time to discover the Colonial Hangover in one of the older parts of the city.",
