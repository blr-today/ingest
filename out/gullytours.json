    "description": "It's a fun walk exploring the night life - history, hertiage, food of CantonmentYou can add your images, videos and itinerary route in lightbox for each itinerary as shown below, simply by changing the src path of each media.Bangalore is a cradle of the coffee culture in India. Locals and tourists both swear by it because no day is complete without a cuppa. But how did this African drink become a local favourite? What role did the British play for coffee in Bangalore? What led to the cafe culture in Bangalore? You'll find answers to all these questions on this tour.\n We will explore the history of the Cantonment, how it evolved to support the British establishment in erstwhile India, and how Bangalore went on to become a melting pot of cultures. As we do this, we will look at the evolution of coffee in the city from traditional coffee houses to new age micro-roasters catering to the needs of the ever changing city, and explore neighbourhoods that still hold stories of the British Raj.\n This tour is the perfect coffee date with the city and a must-do if you're in Bangalore or visiting.

In this walk, we will explore how the British sahibs, memsahibs, and royalty left their mark on the garden city.\n The English influence on the sprawling Cubbon park, the origins of the Cantonment area, and the surrounding architecture are testimony to a lot of events in history. For example, the American War of Independence, the Battle of Waterloo, and the French Revolution had a connection to this region. We will spill more of this tea when you walk with us.\n Whether you are visiting or you are a local, we promise you will see the city in a different light once you learn about the colonial influence on its churches, clubs, parks, and its people.\n Cubbon mornings are a sight to sore eyes, and the perfect time to discover the Colonial Hangover in one of the older parts of the city.",
