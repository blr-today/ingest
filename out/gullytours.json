A local snack soiree that began in the bylanes of Basavanagudi is now quintessential to the Bangalore lifestyle.\n\nIn the tiffin trail, we explore how this story began, people who brought in the tiffin concept and what makes these eateries so special. This South Bangalore trail also takes you on a nostalgia tour of Bangalore in the 60s and 70s, which was the land of playwrights, artists, and authors.\n\nThe eateries where these greats hung out still exist and serve their humble fare to crowds even today, some of whom still serve the same dishes since their inception. But this trail is not just about food. It lets you explore and understand what city planning, local bazaars, and vintage charms feels like.",
