Locals and tourists both swear by it because no day is complete without a cuppa. But how did this African drink become a local favourite? What role did the British play for coffee in Bangalore? What led to the cafe culture in Bangalore? You'll find answers to all these questions on this tour.\n We will explore the history of the Cantonment, how it evolved to support the British establishment in erstwhile India, and how Bangalore went on to become a melting pot of cultures. As we do this, we will look at the evolution of coffee in the city from traditional coffee houses to new age micro-roasters catering to the needs of the ever changing city, and explore neighbourhoods that still hold stories of the British Raj.\n This tour is the perfect coffee date with the city and a must-do if you're in Bangalore or visiting.
