    "description": "This street art walk featuring 13 Indian artists and 12 artworks is an initiative to make neighbourhoods safe, friendly, and full of character in Malleswaram.What makes this tour specialWe\u2019ll start this walk by relishing some legendary dosa at Shri Sagar CTR. From there we\u2019ll visit the conservancy lanes that are adorned with art. We\u2019ll explore the Malleshwaram market, seva sadan, sampige road, and end it at the BMTC bus stand.\n\nMalleswaram is like a warm hug from a handmade shawl on a cold winter day. It\u2019s a modern-day Malgudi with the goodness of history and the excitement of new-age quirks.\n\nStreet art captures the stories of people, their lives, and their neighbourhoods. Show some love to your local artists and let us go to Malleswaram.You can add your images, videos and itinerary route in lightbox for each itinerary as shown below, simply by changing the src path of each media.13 Indian artists came together to create 12 walls filled with art through the secret lanes of Malleswaram to reclaim spaces for pedestrians and women. The Malleswaram Hogona (Eng: Let\u2019s go to Malleswaram) street art project wants to make streets safer for women. Conceived by the Bengaluru moving project, this street art walk is an initiative to make neighbourhoods safe, friendly, and full of character.\n\nApart from being one of the oldest planned neighbourhoods in the city, it houses a flower market, many institutions and lanes adorned with trees. Each work of art tells you the artist\u2019s inspiration and their connection to the landscape, and we\u2019d love to host you here.\n\nLet\u2019s go to Malleswaram to witness modern day murals painted on old world lanes, starting with a legendary breakfast at CTR.",
