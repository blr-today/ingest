In this walk, we will explore how the British sahibs, memsahibs, and royalty left their mark on the garden city.\n\nThe English influence on the sprawling Cubbon park, the origins of the Cantonment area, and the surrounding architecture are testimony to a lot of events in history. For example, the American War of Independence, the Battle of Waterloo, and the French Revolution had a connection to this region. We will spill more of this tea when you walk with us.\n Whether you are visiting or you are a local, we promise you will see the city in a different light once you learn about the colonial influence on its churches, clubs, parks, and its people.\n\nCubbon mornings are a sight to sore eyes, and the perfect time to discover the Colonial Hangover in one of the older parts of the city.",

    "description": "This walk is about different communities that built modern Bangalore. Before the bazaars became popular, Cantonment saw activists, entrepreneurs, and social reformers in the erstwhile British India.What makes this tour specialWe will start the tour at a heritage bungalow and wade through the residential lanes of Shivajinagar, ending it closer to Commercial Street.\n\nWe will explore 100 year old structures, visit different small businesses, and learn about the various historical figures that contributed to education, jobs, and opportunities for the people as well as savour the local favourite snacks and food that are distinct to this part of the city.\n\nThis walk has been specially curated by a local resident, who grew up in the Commercial Street neighbourhood and has lived its rich history.You can add your images, videos and itinerary route in lightbox for each itinerary as shown below, simply by changing the src path of each media.Bangalore\u2019s Cantonment areas are extra special. It\u2019s a melting pot of cultures built together by the locals, immigrants, and the British. In Cantt by night, we will be exploring the lesser-known side of Commercial street, which goes beyond the regular street shopping fare. There are houses, shops, institutions and more that carry the legacy of leaders and prominent names in Bangalore\u2019s history. And of course, no legacy is complete without the presence of food. From a family-run dosa joint to a 48-year-old sweet shop and a legacy bakery, there\u2019s a brilliant food mix on the menu as you explore the ruins and reigns of one of Bangalore\u2019s most popular shopping districts.",
