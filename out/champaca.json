    "description": "\u00a0Join us at the bookstore to tune into this conversation between V. Geetha and Thejaswi Shivanand as they discuss the books in the MAKERS series, by Tara Books. The books being discussed are A POTTER'S TALE, BOAT BUILDERS OF THE COROMANDEL and WEAVING WITH COMPASSION.\u00a0 Read on to know more about these books. A POTTER'S TALE, the first book in the series in which Ramu Velar tells us how he views his craft, vocation and life. Just as his fingers deftly mould a lump of clay to create sturdy pots and beautifully carved bowls, his memory creates sharp as well as dreamy vignettes of his journey from a village potter to a resident craftsman in a museum. Richly textured photographs and evocative illustrations bring alive the world of an unusual and introspective artisan. BOAT BUILDERS OF THE COROMANDEL tells the story of a group of craftsmen who build large wooden cargo boats with their bare hands and simple tools. Stunning on-site photographs bring alive the doing of an unusual craft that requires physical strength as well as dexterity, learnt skills as well as improvisation. A compact narrative, interspersed with the builders\u2019 views on their work, guides the reader through a startling history of making. WEAVING WITH COMPASSION\u00a0offers insight into the life and work of the Meghwal weavers of Kutch. It calls attention to the source of their creativity and the spiritual wisdom that moors them to their craft. Drawing on interviews with weavers, their reflections on their craft and labour, and onsite photographs, the book documents a century of historical change. Equally it celebrates the imagination that has sustained the weavers\u2019 craft and their social lives and relationships. The conversation will cover the stories behind each of the books, and the ones that link them together. The details of the event are as follows:\u00a0 DATE- 11 AUGUST TIME- 5:30 PM VENUE- CHAMPACA BOOKSTORE You can RSVP here to confirm your presence. About the speakers\u00a0 V.
