    "description": "We're ending the Seagull week at Champaca bookstore with a book launch and discussion of 'To Break and to Branch' by Ranjit Hoskote with Mani Rao. \u00a0The details of the event are as follows: Date- 29 June Time- 5 PM Venue- Champaca Bookstore You can  RSVP  on this link.\u00a0 \u00a0 About the\u00a0book:\u00a0 \n \n To Break and to Branch \u00a0is a collection of six essays on the artist Gieve Patel (1940\u20132023), written by poet, cultural theorist, and curator Ranjit Hoskote over nearly two decades, gathered together for the first time and accompanied by over fifty illustrations of Patel\u2019s paintings. In an introductory essay written especially for this edition, Hoskote looks back over the long friendship he shared with Patel, contextualizing it within the vibrant artistic milieu that was once special to Bombay, their home city: a milieu premised on a mutual curiosity that brought the arts together, hospitable to poetry, painting, theater, cinema, music, and architecture. \u00a0 Hoskote\u2019s writings trace both the constant preoccupations and the changing interests that gave Patel\u2019s art its distinctive character and reflect on the aesthetic, philosophical, and political dimensions of Patel\u2019s gradual movement from a human-centric understanding of the world to a more holistic view as generated and sustained by interrelationships across orders of being. \n \n",
