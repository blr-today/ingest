About the book: It has always been Mira, Ma and Ashu. The three of them\u2014as they sing Simon & Garfunkel in Ma\u2019s sun-yellow car, watch TV on the sofa and holiday on the mango farm\u2014are bound firmly together. Yet, beneath this tale of proximity, lurks another story\u2014that of a family in hot water. Nine-year-old Mira, fourteen-year-old Ashu and Ma harbour secrets. All of them confront questions that have no neat answers. Where is Ma\u2019s husband, for instance? Who does Ashu pine for? Why is Mira on the alert? One long, hot summer, the secrets come tumbling out. And the world Ma, Mira and Ashu have cobbled together threatens to give way.
