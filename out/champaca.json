    "description": "Tune in on 8 August for an exciting and illuminating discussion around Sanjena Sathian\u2019s  GODDESS COMPLEX \u2014a thrilling, bitingly satirical novel about the complexities of femininity, parenthood and social norms in the modern age. Sanjena will be in conversation with Nirica Srinivasan on Champaca\u2019s YouTube channel, and the video will also be available on YouTube after the session.\u00a0 Here are the details of the event:\u00a0 Date :  8 August 2025, Friday Time : 7 :30PM YouTube Live Link :  https://www.youtube.com/live/gy30cyhfFcw?si=pZJTD6MpdF-RrE22 About the book:\u00a0 Sanjana Satyananda is trying to recover her life. It\u2019s been a year since she walked out on her husband, a struggling actor named Killian, at a commune in India, after a disagreement about whether to have children. Now, Sanjana is struggling to resurrect her busted anthropology dissertation and crashing at her annoyingly perfect sister\u2019s while her similarly well-adjusted peers obsess over marriages, mortgages, and motherhood. Sanjana needs to move forward-and finalize her divorce, ASAP. There\u2019s just one problem: Killian is missing. As Sanjana tries to track him down, she\u2019s bombarded with unnerving calls from women seeking her advice on pregnancy and fertility. Soon, Sanjana comes face to face-literally-with what her life might have been if she\u2019d chosen parenthood. And the road not taken turns out to be wilder, stranger, and more tempting than she imagined. A darkly funny, genre-bending novel about the dilemmas of procreation, pregnancy, and parenting, Goddess Complex is both a twist-filled psychological thriller and a feminist satire of our age of GirlBosses turned Self Care influencers, optimization cults, social media mommy gurus, egg-freezing crazes, procreative peer pressure, and general uterine madness.\u00a0 About the speakers:\u00a0 Sanjena Sathian  is a writer and essayist who lives in Hong Kong. She is the author of the critically acclaimed novels  GODDESS COMPLEX  and  GOLD DIGGERS . Her short fiction appears in The Best American Short Stories, The Atlantic, Conjunctions, One Story, and more.

She\u2019s an alumna of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and has taught fiction at Emory University, Mercer University, the University of Iowa, and Victoria University.\u00a0 Moderating the session is  Nirica Srinivasan ,  a writer, editor, and illustrator. She is the curator of Champaca Bookstore, interviews editor at Write or Die Magazine, and contributing editor of fiction at Interlocutor Interviews. She is passionate about all forms of storytelling, from literature to cinema to music. At any point in time, she can be found reading at least six books, and excited to talk about all of them.",

It traces the journey of her spiritual awakening and birth into a voice of dissent for the oppressed and dispossessed. Sabari\u2019s is a narrative entwined with the forest along the Pampa river \u2013 one she comes to dwell in and is at one with.

    "description": "What if you could  taste  a book before reading it? Not just skim the blurb, but truly sample its mood, voice, and texture? Welcome to\u00a0Book Tasting  - a one-of-a-kind collaboration between  Champaca  and  Broth Noodle Bar , where food and literature come together in a multi-sensory journey. In this special edition, we travel to\u00a0 Japan  through a thoughtfully paired menu and a curated selection of books. With each course - a steaming bowl of ramen and a matcha-inspired dessert - you\u2019ll be served not only a meal, but also a \u201ctaste\u201d of a story from the region: a short reading, a guided discussion, and space to reflect. Japan\u2019s literary landscape pays attention to its locals - in either describing in vivid detail their domestic lives which sometimes serves as a meta-commentary on political issues, or in taking us to its more surreal corners. Thus one moment, you\u2019re living with pages full of charming stories that feel both tender and comforting ; the next ; you\u2019re confronted with strange metaphors that require you to vigorously exercise your imagination. In a way, literature from Japan is both energetic, gritty and enigmatic as its cities,\u00a0 where neon skywalks co-exist with century old temples. We are delighted to be able to present a selection that offers a portrait of the same. What\u2019s on the menu? Books selected by Radhika Timbadia (Champaca), to match each course Curated dishes prepared by BrothNoodlebar team\u00a0 Kara Tonkotsu (Non-Veg Ramen) A 48-hour simmered pork bone broth served with thin-cut handmade noodles, chashu, soy egg, pickled radish, scallions, and shiitake mushrooms. The standout: Karadare, a house-made sauce crafted from slow-roasted local Byadgi chillies. Tan Tan Veggie Ramen A light vegetable stock enriched with soy milk and sesame paste, topped with spicy tofu crumble, pickled mustard greens, scallions, sesame seeds, and thin alkaline noodles. Dessert \u2013 Matcha White Chocolate Panna Cotta With a sesame-sea salt crumble, this panna cotta combines grassy matcha and smooth white chocolate with a crackle of texture and a touch of salt. Date : 01 August 2025 Time : 7:30 PM Location :  Kale- A Salad Symphony, Indiranagar Ticket : INR 1999 (INR1000 for food, INR 999 fully redeemable on books) PLEASE NOTE:   Our kitchen does not have the capacity to accommodate food allergies.
