    "description": "We\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019ll be hosting acclaimed author Sonali Prasad\u2019s workshop on uncovering stories in reportage, archives and articles and turning them into compelling character sketches and ecological narratives. Join us on 24th August at our Indiranagar bookstore to slow down and really look at the world and the stories that always surround us. Here are the details of the workshop:\u00a0 Date : 24th August 2025, Sunday Time : 11AM - 1:00PM Venue : Champaca Bookstore, Indiranagar Fees : INR 1200 (including Sonali Prasad\u2019s book, Glass Bottom) Since there are limited slots available, we encourage you to  sign up here! ABOUT THE EVENT: Where do stories come from? In the beginning, they were songs. Passed down, from generation to generation, they morphed and changed. Those with boundless imagination drew upon these stories, inventing new characters and situations, changing details and making retellings. Millennials passed, and five thousand years ago, we started writing our stories down. Tablets with engraved stories travelled across seas and mountains, reaching the hands of cultures so distant, stories felt alien and impossible. Perhaps they were even more valuable in foreign lands than in native ones, for in distant cultures, they inspired others to write stories that were new, weird and unique. That tradition has continued; in pre-civil war America, Margaret Garner, an African-American woman killed her daughter to save her from slavery. More than a century later, Toni Morrison came across a clipping from 1856, about Garner\u2019s infanticide. Inspired by Garner\u2019s story, she wrote her award winning masterpiece, Beloved. Many writers have drawn inspiration from other stories;  Carrie  was inspired  by an article  Stephen King read  about the possibility of telekinesis in young girls during puberty,  Susan Orlean's  The Orchid Thief  started with an article about the arrest of John Laroche, a plant dealer in Florida. In this workshop, Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship winner Sonali Prasad will teach attendees how to spot stories in the world around us through magazines, reports and testimonies and how to use them as launching pads for rich character studies and narrative structures. Using clips from her book,  Glass Bottom,  she will discuss working around the central questions in a story and how narrative journeys can help answer them. She will focus on ecological stories, and the interactions of humans with nature. About The Book : Glass Bottom : \u00a0 Gul, Arth, Luni and Himmo live by the sea that bestows as much waste as wonder upon the shores. When a storm passes through their small town, the two mother-daughter pairs are pulled into a whirlwind of deep entanglements and hidden desires.Each of them is forced to confront the turbulence within and around themselves: Gul, tethered to the earth\u2019s seismic murmurs, finds herself unravelling with the weather. Her daughter Arth grapples with the territories of personal and collective memory. Luni, threading her hopes and fears into her embroidery, tries to find solace amidst the chaos, while her daughter Himmo, drawn to the forbidden ocean, explores where her search and longing might take her. Set against the intractable Arabian Sea,  Glass Bottom  offers a profound and lyrical meditation on the ordinary and strange places we occupy, and the ties binding us to our planet and to each other. About the Author: Sonali Prasad  was born and raised in New Delhi, India. Her journalism has appeared in publications such as The Guardian, The Washington Post, Hakai Magazine, Quartz, and Esquire Singapore. She has been awarded a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship, Global TED Fellowship, MIT Knight Science Journalism Fellowship, Logan Science Journalism Fellowship and a Jan Michalski Writing Residency, among other grants and honours. Her debut novel, Glass Bottom, was published by Picador India (2024), who called it their 'literary debut of the year'. It was listed in Telegraph India's 'The page turners of 2024: Fiction' and was shortlisted for the Kalinga Literary Festival Book Award in the category 'Debut (English)'.",

    "description": "In a world increasingly populated by and filtered through screens, the book is a source of unending comfort and joy: a physical, enduring presence that holds stories, art, and memories within its pages, and takes on a life of its own.

    "description": "What if you could  taste  a book before reading it? Not just skim the blurb, but truly sample its mood, voice, and texture? Welcome to\u00a0Book Tasting  - a one-of-a-kind collaboration between  Champaca  and  Broth Noodle Bar , where food and literature come together in a multi-sensory journey. In this special edition, we travel to\u00a0 Japan  through a thoughtfully paired menu and a curated selection of books. With each course - a steaming bowl of ramen and a matcha-inspired dessert - you\u2019ll be served not only a meal, but also a \u201ctaste\u201d of a story from the region: a short reading, a guided discussion, and space to reflect. Japan\u2019s literary landscape pays attention to its locals - in either describing in vivid detail their domestic lives which sometimes serves as a meta-commentary on political issues, or in taking us to its more surreal corners. Thus one moment, you\u2019re living with pages full of charming stories that feel both tender and comforting ; the next ; you\u2019re confronted with strange metaphors that require you to vigorously exercise your imagination. In a way, literature from Japan is both energetic, gritty and enigmatic as its cities,\u00a0 where neon skywalks co-exist with century old temples. We are delighted to be able to present a selection that offers a portrait of the same. What\u2019s on the menu? Books selected by Radhika Timbadia (Champaca), to match each course Curated dishes prepared by BrothNoodlebar team\u00a0 Kara Tonkotsu (Non-Veg Ramen) A 48-hour simmered pork bone broth served with thin-cut handmade noodles, chashu, soy egg, pickled radish, scallions, and shiitake mushrooms. The standout: Karadare, a house-made sauce crafted from slow-roasted local Byadgi chillies. Tan Tan Veggie Ramen A light vegetable stock enriched with soy milk and sesame paste, topped with spicy tofu crumble, pickled mustard greens, scallions, sesame seeds, and thin alkaline noodles. Dessert \u2013 Matcha White Chocolate Panna Cotta With a sesame-sea salt crumble, this panna cotta combines grassy matcha and smooth white chocolate with a crackle of texture and a touch of salt. Date : 01 August 2025 Time : 7:30 PM Location :  Kale- A Salad Symphony, Indiranagar Ticket : INR 1999 (INR1000 for food, INR 999 fully redeemable on books) PLEASE NOTE:   Our kitchen does not have the capacity to accommodate food allergies. Please review the ingredients carefully before registering. Spots are limited \u2013 reserve your seat soon!\u00a0 RSVP now Let us know your food preferences here",
