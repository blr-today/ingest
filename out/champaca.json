    "description": "We are thrilled to be screening  Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin , a documentary by Arwen Curry, at our bookstore this November! Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin  is a feature documentary exploring the remarkable life and legacy of the late feminist author  Ursula K. Le Guin.  Best known for groundbreaking science fiction and fantasy works such as  A Wizard of Earthsea, The Left Hand of Darkness, and The Dispossessed , Le Guin held her ground on the margin of \u201crespectable\u201d literature until the sheer excellence of her work, at long last, forced the mainstream to embrace fantastic literature. Her fascinating story has never before been captured on film.\u00a0 Watch the trailer. Produced with Le Guin\u2019s participation over the course of a decade,  Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin  is a journey through the writer\u2019s career and her worlds, both real and fantastic. Viewers will join the writer on an intimate journey of self-discovery as she comes into her own as a major feminist author, opening new doors for the imagination and inspiring generations of women and other marginalized writers along the way.\u00a0 The film features stunning animation and reflections by literary luminaries including Margaret Atwood, David Mitchell, Michael Chabon, and more.\u00a0 Filmmaker\u00a0Arwen Curry with the author during the production of  Worlds of Ursula K.Le Guin.
