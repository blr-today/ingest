    "description": "\u200bJoin Santanu Bhattacharya and Anuja Chauhan as they discuss DEVIANTS, Santanu's latest book.\u00a0 The details of the\u00a0event are as follows-\u00a0 DAY- Saturday DATE- 8th February 2025 TIME- 5 PM Please  RSVP here  since the seating for this event will be limited.\u00a0 About the book \n Vivaan, a teenager in India\u2019s silicon plateau, has discovered love on his smartphone. Intoxicating, boundary-breaking love. His parents know he is gay, and their support is something Vivaan can count on, but they don\u2019t know what exactly their son gets up to in the online world. For his uncle, born thirty years earlier, things were very different. Mambro\u2019s life changed forever when he fell for a male classmate at a time, and in a country, where the persecution of gay people was rife under a colonial-era law criminalising homosexuality. And before that was Mambro\u2019s uncle Sukumar, a young man hopelessly in love with another young man, but forced by social taboos to keep their relationship a secret at all costs. Sukumar would never live the life he yearned for, but his story would ignite and inspire his nephew and grand-nephew after him. Bold and bracing, intimate and heartbreaking,\u00a0 DEVIANTS \u00a0examines the histories we inherit and the legacies we leave behind. \n \n \n About the speakers\u00a0 Santanu Bhattacharya\u00a0 grew up in India, and studied at the University of Oxford and the National University of Singapore. He won the Desmond Elliott Prize Residency in 2023, and the Mo Siewcharran and Life Writing Prizes in 2021. His first novel, \u00a0One Small Voic e, was an Observer best debut novel of 2023, and was shortlisted for the Authors' Club Best First Novel Award and the Society of Authors\u2019 Gordon Bowker Volcano Prize. He now lives in London. \n \n Anuja Chauhan  worked in advertising for over seventeen years and is credited with many popular campaigns, including PepsiCo's Nothing Official About It, Yeh Dil Maange More, Mera Number Kab Aayega, Oye Bubbly and Darr ke Aage Jeet Hai.
