On this trek \u2013 rapturous, dangerous, and life-changing \u2013 Akshaya will discover what human existence really means.

Kuvempu's multi-centred text, with its organic weave of varied narrative strands, much like the Mahabharata, is epic in substance and style. The novel, which is rooted in the regional realities of Malnad, is yet another example of the diversity of modern Indian literature. This epic novel with the sweep of a Tolstoy classic enacts its mission statement: 'Here, nobody is important; nobody is unimportant; nothing is insignificant!' with brilliance, energy and imaginative power.

    "description": "\u200bJoin Shahnaz Habib in conversation with Rohini Mohan as they discuss\u00a0AIRPLANE MODE: A PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE HISTORY OF TRAVEL.\u00a0 The details of the\u00a0event are as follows-\u00a0 DAY- Thursday DATE- 30TH January 2025 TIME- 6 PM The seating will be limited. We request you to  RSVP here  to confirm your presence.\u00a0 About the book This witty personal and cultural history of travel from the perspective of a Third World\u2013raised woman of colour asks: What does it mean to be a joyous traveller when we live in the ruins of colonialism, capitalism and climate change? The conditions of travel have long been dictated by the colours of passports and the colour of skin. This insightful debut by Shahnaz Habib parses who gets to travel, and who gets to write about the experience. All the while, she threads the historic but ever-evolving dynamics of travel into her personal story as a child on family vacations in India, an adult curious about the world, and an immigrant for whom round trips are an annual fact of life.\u00a0 Woven throughout the book are inviting and playful analyses of obvious and not-so-obvious travel artefacts: passports, carousels, bougainvilleas, guidebooks, trains, the idea of wanderlust itself. Together, they tell a subversive history of travel as a Euro-American mode of consumerism\u2014but as any traveller knows, travel is more than that.\u00a0 About the speakers\u00a0 \n Shahnaz Habib  is the author of the nonfiction book AIRPLANE MODE, and the translator of the novel JASMINE DAYS, for which she and the author Benyamin won the JCB Prize, India's most valuable prize for literature. Her short stories and nonfiction have appeared in The New Yorker online, Creative Nonfiction, Agni, Brevity, The Guardian, and Afar. She has been awarded a New York Foundation for the Arts Artists' Fellowship in Nonfiction Literature, and her work has been cited in the Best American Essays series. She holds a BA from Mahatma Gandhi University, an MA in English Literature from the University of Delhi, and an MA in Media Studies from the New School. \n Rohini Mohan  is a prize-winning political journalist based in Bangalore, India.
