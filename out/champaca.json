Good Arguments  follows Delphi, a young woman in Bangalore who discovers theatre and is drawn into rehearsals, friendships and a fragile arts scene. As a new venue, Navarasa, is about to open and the 2012 Delhi gangrape and protests shake the country, the questions she explores on stage about voice and power spill into her everyday life. It is a coming-of-age novel about making art with limited resources, and about who gets to tell which stories. Deepika Arwind  is an award-winning writer and playwright whose work has been produced on many continents.  Good Argumnets  is her debut novel. She divides her time between Berlin and Bangalore. she always wanted to say that but now that she actually does, she realises it\u2019s a far more exhausting predicament that she thought it would be. She thinks that in general bios should be funnier and finds Sharanya\u2019s preferable to her own.\u00a0 Sharanya tells  people she's a theatre maker but she's not. She's a theatre breaker. She's a bored housewife in Basavanagudi drinking single malt whiskey in steel tumblers. She has fascinating insights on idli dose and monogamy. She made a show with Deepika in 2018 called \u2018I am not here: an 8-step guide on how to censor women\u2019s writing\u2019. And here she is in conversation about writing and theatre with her.",

    "description": "This January, join us at our Indiranagar store for a sensory storytelling session inspired by  Rain Perfume  by Niveditha Reddy, illustrated by Shubshree Mathur. Children will step into Boondi\u2019s world of rain, Thatha, and that familiar wet-earth smell many of us love. As they listen to the story of how Boondi finds a way to share the joy of the first rain with her grandfather, they\u2019ll move like rain-loving creatures, solve small puzzles, play with the sounds of thunder and raindrops, and respond to the monsoon through simple art activities. Date:  Saturday, 10 January 2026   Time:  11:00 AM onwards   Venue:  Champaca Bookstore, Indiranagar   Age group:  4\u20138 years Rain Perfume , published by Kalpavriksh, follows Boondi, a little girl who adores the smell of rain and wants to share it with her bedridden Thatha. It\u2019s a gentle story about love, intergenerational bonds, and noticing the quiet but powerful changes nature brings with the monsoon. The book captures the scent of wet soil, small family rituals around rain, and the way children often notice what adults overlook. At the event, children will hear the story read aloud and then explore its ideas through play, art, and conversation. Niveditha is an engineer-turned-writer who discovered her love for storytelling while spinning tales for her young son. Inspired by her travels and everyday encounters, she writes regularly for children\u2019s magazines across genres, with stories that help young readers connect with themselves and the world around them.
