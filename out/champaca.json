About the book:\u00a0 HOW TO CLIMB A TREE , Aparna's deeply lyrical photobook, is a personal, intuitive image series that episodically documents a timespan when her 10-year-old son was living in a boarding school in Madanapalle, India. What emerges is a collaborative project between mother and son drawn over five years of communication, wherein the images become meditative, introspective traces of places and moments that felt like home for both of them. Interspersed with handwritten letters and illustrations, the book examines how a physical absence or distance can be expressively redrafted through emotional awareness. In this photobook, Aparna creates a safe space - one in which she allows her own vulnerability of the experience of motherhood to slip through while also trying to root her son, giving him a way to return to this time and space again and again.\u00a0 About the speakers:\u00a0 Author: \u00a0 Aparna Nori \u00a0is a photographer and visual artist based between Singapore and Bangalore, India.
