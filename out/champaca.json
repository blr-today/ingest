    "description": "What if you could  taste  a book before reading it? Not just skim the blurb, but truly sample its mood, voice, and texture? Welcome to\u00a0Book Tasting  - a one-of-a-kind collaboration between  Champaca  and  Broth Noodle Bar , where food and literature come together in a multi-sensory journey. In this special edition, we travel to\u00a0 Japan  through a thoughtfully paired menu and a curated selection of books. With each course - a steaming bowl of ramen and a matcha-inspired dessert - you\u2019ll be served not only a meal, but also a \u201ctaste\u201d of a story from the region: a short reading, a guided discussion, and space to reflect. Japan\u2019s literary landscape pays attention to its locals - in either describing in vivid detail their domestic lives which sometimes serves as a meta-commentary on political issues, or in taking us to its more surreal corners. Thus one moment, you\u2019re living with pages full of charming stories that feel both tender and comforting ; the next ; you\u2019re confronted with strange metaphors that require you to vigorously exercise your imagination. In a way, literature from Japan is both energetic, gritty and enigmatic as its cities,\u00a0 where neon skywalks co-exist with century old temples. We are delighted to be able to present a selection that offers a portrait of the same. What\u2019s on the menu? Books selected by Radhika Timbadia (Champaca), to match each course Curated dishes prepared by BrothNoodlebar team\u00a0 Kara Tonkotsu (Non-Veg Ramen) A 48-hour simmered pork bone broth served with thin-cut handmade noodles, chashu, soy egg, pickled radish, scallions, and shiitake mushrooms. The standout: Karadare, a house-made sauce crafted from slow-roasted local Byadgi chillies. Tan Tan Veggie Ramen A light vegetable stock enriched with soy milk and sesame paste, topped with spicy tofu crumble, pickled mustard greens, scallions, sesame seeds, and thin alkaline noodles. Dessert \u2013 Matcha White Chocolate Panna Cotta With a sesame-sea salt crumble, this panna cotta combines grassy matcha and smooth white chocolate with a crackle of texture and a touch of salt. Date : 01 August 2025 Time : 7:30 PM Location :  Kale- A Salad Symphony, Indiranagar Ticket : INR 1999 (INR1000 for food, INR 999 fully redeemable on books) PLEASE NOTE:   Our kitchen does not have the capacity to accommodate food allergies.
