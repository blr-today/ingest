    "description": "Join us for an exciting evening with Gautam Bhatia and Aakar Patel as they discuss Gautam Bhatia's latest book THE SENTENCE. The SENTENCE tells the story of Jagat, an anarchist politician who goes down in history for becoming a martyr and preventing civil war.\u00a0 A little more about the book:\u00a0 An impoverished young man, Jagat, is found guilty of murder. For his crime, he is sentenced to the highest form of punishment\u2014the sleep of death for a century, with the promise of revival should his innocence ever be proven. But his act sparks violence in the great city of Peruma, with the Commune, an anarchist collective of workers, revolting against the Council, which has ruled Peruma for four hundred years. Drained by endless conflict, Council and Commune negotiate a hundred-year treaty that is to be enforced by an impartial body: the guardians of the Confederation. And now, a century later, the Charter is a week away from lapsing. Tensions run high in Peruma. As an uncertain future looms, Nila, a young guardian, is approached by a mysterious woman who insists that Jagat\u2019s case be reopened before it\u2019s too late. Drawn by the prospect of undoing a possible historical injustice, Nila agrees. But as she begins to unearth the past, forces, known and unknown, thwart her at every turn. What secrets does the city hold? Who is working in the shadows against her\u2014and why? What is the price of resurrecting a martyr?\u00a0 The Sentence \u00a0raises questions about justice, rights and ethics that will echo in your mind long after you\u2019ve turned the last page. \u2018There may be a time, Guardian, when it doesn\u2019t matter whether our peace is founded on the truth or a lie. All that matters is that there is peace.\u2019 Do  RSVP here  to confirm your presence since the seating would be limited.\u00a0 The event details are as follows:\u00a0 DATE- 22 DECEMBER, SUNDAY\u00a0 TIME- 6 PM VENUE- CHAMPACA BOOKSTORE \n \n About the speakers:\u00a0 \n Gautam Bhatia is an Indian SF writer, reviewer and editor, based in New Delhi.
