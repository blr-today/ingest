When he later lived in Delhi and Bathinda, he reluctantly learned to bend the rules. That was the beginning of his interest in the Constitution. He then moved back to Bangalore where he now lives with his wife, Amarinder, sons Geet and Neil, and dog Norah. On weekdays, he runs. On weekends, he naps. He more or less follows the rules always. Vinay Kumar Vinay Kumar is an Aerospace Engineer & founder of\u00a0 #ReclaimConstitution , a project aimed at fostering a constitutional culture.
