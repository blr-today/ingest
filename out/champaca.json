    "description": "This January, join us at our Indiranagar store for a sensory storytelling session inspired by  Rain Perfume  by Niveditha Reddy, illustrated by Shubshree Mathur. Children will step into Boondi\u2019s world of rain, Thatha, and that familiar wet-earth smell many of us love. As they listen to the story of how Boondi finds a way to share the joy of the first rain with her grandfather, they\u2019ll move like rain-loving creatures, solve small puzzles, play with the sounds of thunder and raindrops, and respond to the monsoon through simple art activities. Date:  Saturday, 10 January 2026   Time:  11:00 AM onwards   Venue:  Champaca Bookstore, Indiranagar   Age group:  4\u20138 years Rain Perfume , published by Kalpavriksh, follows Boondi, a little girl who adores the smell of rain and wants to share it with her bedridden Thatha. It\u2019s a gentle story about love, intergenerational bonds, and noticing the quiet but powerful changes nature brings with the monsoon. The book captures the scent of wet soil, small family rituals around rain, and the way children often notice what adults overlook. At the event, children will hear the story read aloud and then explore its ideas through play, art, and conversation. Niveditha is an engineer-turned-writer who discovered her love for storytelling while spinning tales for her young son. Inspired by her travels and everyday encounters, she writes regularly for children\u2019s magazines across genres, with stories that help young readers connect with themselves and the world around them. As seating is limited, please  RSVP here  to book your spot. \u00a0",
