    "startDate": "2024-08-24T17:00:00+05:30",

    "description": "Join Rohan Chakravarty and Menaka Raman as they discuss Rohan's latest novel SEA ICE? NOW YOU DON'T! This is the third anthology of the multi-award winning series Green humour comics. From penguins balancing their nests on thin ice to tigers basking in their own glamour whilst worrying about their future, from ghazal-loving bats to whales dumping marine plastic waste right back at us, in SEA ICE? NOW YOU DON'T! you meet an array of wild animals with their own list of concerns, and their own brand of humour. The comics will take you from the high skies to geothermal mines in the very bottom of the ocean, and from sweltering tropical mangroves to the icy poles, engaging you in discussions about ecology, biology, nature conservation, and the politics of governing nature. This is a wild ride for sure, but NOT one which needs you to leave your brains at home! SEA ICE? NOW YOU DON'T!  is the third in the series of Green Humour collections, after \u2018Green Humour for a Greying Planet\u2019 and \u2018Pugmarks and Carbon Footprints\u2019, and includes comics published in periodic columns with platforms like \u00a0 DW News , \u00a0 The Hindu , \u00a0 Roundglass Sustain , and \u00a0 Gocomics. About the speakers Rohan Chakravarty is the creator of Green Humour, a series of comics and illustrations on wildlife and nature conservation. He lives in Nagpur where he goes on nature trails every day, led by his pet dogs Srishti and Sakshi.\u00a0 Rohan has authored seven other books, including Green Humour for a Greying Planet, Naturalist Ruddy, and Pugmarks and Carbon Footprints. Although he has won awards by UNDP, Sanctuary Asia, WWF International, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Green and Bangalore Literature Festivals for his work, a fig that once dropped out of a hornbill\u2019s mouth straight into his palm remains his most cherished prize. His worst nightmare is that the wildlife featured in his comics will read them and gang up on him for revenge some day. Menaka Raman is the author of a number of books for children including HOW TO WIN AN ELECTION (A MOST UNRELIABLE GUIDE), WHAT DO WE NAME THIS DOG and THE FREEDOM SISTERS. Her novel LOKI TAKES GUARD won the Valley of Words Award for Writing for Young Adults. She is a regular contributor to The Hindu Sunday Magazine. Kindly\u00a0 RSVP here \u00a0as there is limited seating.\u00a0 The details of the events are as follows: DATE- 24 AUGUST 2024 DAY- SATURDAY TIME- 5 PM VENUE- CHAMPACA BOOKSTORE",
