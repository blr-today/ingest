    "description": "Join us on Sunday, 15th June, for a presentation of  How to Climb a Tree,  Aparna Nori\u2019s beautiful and deeply personal photobook. Aparna will be in conversation with Gayatri Ganju and Kaamna Patel. Come to marvel over the stunning photographs and intricate illustrations; stay for a meditation on art, time, belonging, and growing up.\u00a0 Here are the event details:\u00a0 Date : 15 June 2025, Sunday Time:   5:30PM Venue:   Champaca Bookstore, Vasanth Nagar Since there is limited seating, we recommend that you confirm your spot soon\u2014 RSVP here! About the book:\u00a0 HOW TO CLIMB A TREE , Aparna's deeply lyrical photobook, is a personal, intuitive image series that episodically documents a timespan when her 10-year-old son was living in a boarding school in Madanapalle, India. What emerges is a collaborative project between mother and son drawn over five years of communication, wherein the images become meditative, introspective traces of places and moments that felt like home for both of them. Interspersed with handwritten letters and illustrations, the book examines how a physical absence or distance can be expressively redrafted through emotional awareness. In this photobook, Aparna creates a safe space - one in which she allows her own vulnerability of the experience of motherhood to slip through while also trying to root her son, giving him a way to return to this time and space again and again.\u00a0 About the speakers:\u00a0 Author: \u00a0 Aparna Nori \u00a0is a photographer and visual artist based between Singapore and Bangalore, India. Aparna draws upon personal memory to have a dialogue with the quotidian. Her response is articulated through a range of mediums including alternative photographic processes, installations, video, digital photography and the book form. Aparna is a member of Women Photograph. Moderators:\u00a0 Gayatri Ganju  (b. 1989) is an artist and documentary photographer from Bangalore.

    "description": "Join us at Champaca with Pankaj Singh and Athulya Pillai   for the launch of their new book Eldo, and a conversation around their bestselling title Yangdol. The session will be moderated by Ramya Reddy. These are stories that invite you to slow down and notice- whether it\u2019s the Himalayan landscape, or the unfamiliar comfort of darkness. Told through words and illustrations, both Eldo and  Yangdol  open up quiet, intimate worlds. We\u2019re delighted to bring you this evening of storytelling and reflection, surrounded by books and conversation. About the Books: Eldo  is two things at once- an evocative visual essay on darkness and a story about a walk into a storm, in the dead of night. It asks: what does it mean to step out into the dark? Who do we become in the absence of light? What do we notice when our eyes and our senses adjust? This poetic inquiry explores our fading relationship with the night, and how our bodies, once intuitive instruments of perception, are growing distant from it. Eldo is a meditation on stillness, silence, and shadow- an invitation to reimagine darkness not as fearsome, but as full. Their earlier book,  Yangdol , is set in a remote Himalayan village in Ladakh, and follows a young girl\u2019s lifelong yearning to see the elusive snow leopard- the \u2018Grey Ghost\u2019. Woven with memory and wonder, Yangdol is a tender reflection on patience, kinship, and growing up close to the wild. More than just a tale of pursuit, it speaks to the values passed down in rural Ladakh- of gentleness, kindness, and the quiet dignity of coexistence. Written for readers aged 7 and above, it has captivated readers of all ages. Here are the Event Details: Date: \u00a0 May 31, 2025, Saturday Time: \u00a0  5:30 PM Location:   Champaca Bookstore, Vasanth Nagar Since there is limited seating, we recommend you confirm your spot  here . About the Speakers: Pankaj Singh  is a writer and filmmaker whose work reflects his deep curiosity for the natural world. Through Faraway Originals, a collective he co-founded, he tells stories that lie at the intersection of nature, science, and human connection. His narratives are quiet, immersive, and rooted in simplicity. Athulya Pillai  is an illustrator and storyteller based in Bangalore. Her work is grounded in observation\u2014of creatures, places, and people\u2014and often leans into themes of wildlife conservation and ecological memory. With her delicate lines and thoughtful visual language, Athulya brings the emotional texture of landscapes and lives to the page. Moderating the conversation is Ramya Reddy, visual storyteller, photographer and author of  Soul of the Nilgiris: A Journey through the Mountains . Ramya\u2019s work intimately explores the Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve and its indigenous communities, blending narrative, image, and design. She collaborates closely with Toda women artisans and is deeply committed to cultural and ecological preservation.",
