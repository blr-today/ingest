    "startDate": "2024-04-21T10:00:00+05:30",
    "description": "Join us on 21 April at 10:00 AM for a workshop on painting with botanical inks! An introduction to botanical colours, this workshop brings together elements of everyday science of pigments in nature, towards creating art. It also hopes to bring focus to what we call or consider \u2018waste\u2019 in our everyday lives and what we do with it. The workshop is designed in two parts. First half will involve making the botanical inks from kitchen and garden scraps. The second part will give participants the time and space to paint with the inks, on paper. In groups, participants will learn to extract inks from the botanical sources using simple techniques. Using these inks, each participant will get to make individual artworks for them to take home. Best suited for adults (18 years+) No prior experience required. All materials will be provided. RSVP  here Sudha Palepu  is a natural colour artist and exhibition designer. A graduate of NID, Ahmedabad and SOAS, University of London, she works in the culture interpretation sector. In 2020, she started her art practice in creating inks and pigments from natural sources, using which she makes ephemeral art. Sudha conducts natural colour workshops as a way to publicly engage with cultural perceptions around colour and its occurrence in nature as well as in human-made environments",
