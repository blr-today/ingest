    "description": "Some stories are timeless, returning to us with new meanings each time they are retold.

At this special discussion, poet and translator  Sharmistha Mohanty  will be in conversation with writer and scholar  Mani Rao , exploring how translation can revive, reframe, and reimagine Tagore\u2019s narratives for new generations. Together, they will reflect on the enduring power of Tagore\u2019s explorations of love, alienation, memory, and the fragile strength of women\u2019s lives. Here are the details: Date: 4 October 2025 Time: 6:00 PM Venue: Champaca Bookstore, Vasanth Nagar Since seats are limited, we recommend you  sign up here. About the Book:\u00a0 This selection of Tagore\u2019s stories exemplifies his remarkable ability to enter the complexities of human relationships. Within seemingly simple plots, Tagore portrays with unusual compassion and lyricism the predicament of Bengali women in traditional contexts\u2014moving from the loneliness of an intelligent, beautiful woman neglected by her husband in his acclaimed novella  Broken Nest  to the powerlessness of a young girl whose prized possession is taken away in  Notebook , from the casual abandonment of an orphan in  Postmaster  to a girl robbed of her childhood in  The Ghat\u2019s Tale . Powerful in their simplicity, brilliant in their astuteness, the novella and three short stories included in this collection\u2014translated by acclaimed poet and fiction writer  Sharmistha Mohanty \u2014are some of the Nobel Laureate\u2019s finest prose works. About the Speakers:\u00a0 Sharmistha Mohanty  is a celebrated Indian poet and fiction writer.
