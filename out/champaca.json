    "description": "Join us on 13 April at 11:30 for a hands-on session with Ashwin Prabhu on his new book, \" Sculpted Stones - Mysteries of Mamallapuram \".\u00a0 \n RSVP  here \u00a0 Thanks to formulaic ways of teaching, children often mistake history to be nothing but a bundle of facts - \u00a0 years, names, dynasties and battles . Some children who have a flair for memory respond well to this approach, while most others are quite put off by the singular focus on 'knowledge'. In similar fashion, art in school is usually treated as something meant for those who are able to master a particular technique - again ending up being only for the 'talented' few. What if there is a way to introduce children to history and art through a process of learning which uses first-hand observation, description and even a little imagination! What if this means that children can be freed from the fear of being wrong! In a hands-on session, using his book \" Sculpted Stones - Mysteries of Mamallapuram \", \u00a0 Ashwin \u00a0 will work with children on a set of exercises which exposes them to this exciting new way of engaging with historical art. Expect stunning visuals projected onto a screen, a few simple worksheets, and lots of dialogue to deepen learning.",

    "duration": "PT2H",
    "description": "Join us on 21 April at 10:00 AM for a workshop on painting with botanical inks! An introduction to botanical colours, this workshop brings together elements of everyday science of pigments in nature, towards creating art. It also hopes to bring focus to what we call or consider \u2018waste\u2019 in our everyday lives and what we do with it. The workshop is designed in two parts. First half will involve making the botanical inks from kitchen and garden scraps. The second part will give participants the time and space to paint with the inks, on paper. In groups, participants will learn to extract inks from the botanical sources using simple techniques. Using these inks, each participant will get to make individual artworks for them to take home. Best suited for adults (18 years+) No prior experience required. All materials will be provided. RSVP  here Sudha Palepu  is a natural colour artist and exhibition designer. A graduate of NID, Ahmedabad and SOAS, University of London, she works in the culture interpretation sector. In 2020, she started her art practice in creating inks and pigments from natural sources, using which she makes ephemeral art. Sudha conducts natural colour workshops as a way to publicly engage with cultural perceptions around colour and its occurrence in nature as well as in human-made environments",
