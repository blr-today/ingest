    "description": "Join us on Sunday, 29 June, for the launch of Meera Ganapathi\u2019s new book  HOW TO FORGET: A BOOK OF SHORT STEPS AND LONG WALKS , a gentle, lyrical exploration of the act of walking, and how it helps us lose and find ourselves. Meera will be in conversation with Joshua Muyiwa, and the discussion promises to be profound and insightful\u2014perhaps in unexpected ways. Here are the details of the event:\u00a0 Date:  29 June 2025, Sunday Time:   6:00PM Venue:   Champaca Bookstore, Vasanth Nagar Since there is limited seating, we recommend that you  confirm your spot  soon. About the book:\u00a0 In spare and lucid lines of poetry and prose,  How to Forget  takes the reader on a walk through childhood, love, loss and longing. Told through memory and impressions both personal and communal, the book chronicles lifetimes through the act of walking. These journeys often follow the same paths but end in unexpected conclusions. An elephant wanders through tea estates in the Nilgiris, a woman confronts the night, prawns are tossed in chilli oil, a childhood is lost and solitude is found in fifty-five walks across cities and timelines. With gentle and insightful observations, Ganapathi offers soothing respite from the chaos of our cities and the clamour of our thoughts. About the speakers: Meera Ganapathi  is a former advertising professional, and the founder and editor of the literary and arts publication, The Soup. She has written various books for children, like  THE GIRL WHO COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING, UMA VS UPMA, A FRIEND FOR POOCHI  and  PAATI VS UNCLE .  Her poems and short stories have appeared in several anthologies, including,  CAT PEOPLE  and  A CASE OF INDIAN MARVELS: DAZZLING SHORT STORIES BY INDIA'S FINEST WRITERS . Meera lives in Goa with her baby, her partner and her misunderstood cat, Apple. Moderating the session is  Joshua Muyiwa , a Bangalore-based poet and freelance writer, editor and columnist. He has written for publications like The Week, Tehelka, Bangalore Mirror, Firstpost, Mint Lounge, Conde Nast Traveller, and the Hindu Business Line amongst others. His poems have appeared in  POETRY WITH PRAKRITI, THE WORLD THAT BELONGS TO US: AN ANTHOLOGY OF QUEER POETRY FROM SOUTH ASIA  and  elsewhere.

    "description": "Join us on Sunday, 15th June, for a presentation of  How to Climb a Tree,  Aparna Nori\u2019s beautiful and deeply personal photobook. Aparna will be in conversation with Gayatri Ganju and Kaamna Patel. Come to marvel over the stunning photographs and intricate illustrations; stay for a meditation on art, time, belonging, and growing up.\u00a0 Here are the event details:\u00a0 Date : 15 June 2025, Sunday Time:   5:30PM Venue:   Champaca Bookstore, Vasanth Nagar Since there is limited seating, we recommend that you confirm your spot soon\u2014 RSVP here! About the book:\u00a0 HOW TO CLIMB A TREE , Aparna's deeply lyrical photobook, is a personal, intuitive image series that episodically documents a timespan when her 10-year-old son was living in a boarding school in Madanapalle, India. What emerges is a collaborative project between mother and son drawn over five years of communication, wherein the images become meditative, introspective traces of places and moments that felt like home for both of them. Interspersed with handwritten letters and illustrations, the book examines how a physical absence or distance can be expressively redrafted through emotional awareness. In this photobook, Aparna creates a safe space - one in which she allows her own vulnerability of the experience of motherhood to slip through while also trying to root her son, giving him a way to return to this time and space again and again.\u00a0 About the speakers:\u00a0 Author: \u00a0 Aparna Nori \u00a0is a photographer and visual artist based between Singapore and Bangalore, India. Aparna draws upon personal memory to have a dialogue with the quotidian.
