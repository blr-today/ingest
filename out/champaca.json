    "description": "When children step into a story, they don\u2019t just meet characters, they meet ideas that shape how they think. This November, Champaca is partnering with SkilLit Readers, a story-led skills lab, to launch the Emerging Readers Programme for children aged 6\u20139. This programme transforms books into springboards for reflection, expression, and connection, nurturing confidence, critical thinking, and creativity. In this first edition, children will explore the theme of inclusivity, engaging with books that open conversations about belonging, empathy, and courage. Our November\u2013December batch will explore this theme through two wonderful books: Left-Out Paru  by Bijal Vachharajani Manya Learns to Roar  by Shruthi Rao Here are the details: Dates:  Every Saturday from 1 November to 13 December 2025 ( except 6 December) Time:  11:00 AM \u2013 12:30 PM Venue:  Champaca Bookstore, Indiranagar Age Group:  6\u20139 years Fee  : INR 7000 Since seating is limited,  sign up here!
