    "description": "Join us on Sunday, 29 June, for the launch of Meera Ganapathi\u2019s new book  HOW TO FORGET: A BOOK OF SHORT STEPS AND LONG WALKS , a gentle, lyrical exploration of the act of walking, and how it helps us lose and find ourselves. Meera will be in conversation with Joshua Muyiwa, and the discussion promises to be profound and insightful\u2014perhaps in unexpected ways. Here are the details of the event:\u00a0 Date:  29 June 2025, Sunday Time:   6:00PM Venue:   Champaca Bookstore, Vasanth Nagar Since there is limited seating, we recommend that you  confirm your spot  soon. About the book:\u00a0 In spare and lucid lines of poetry and prose,  How to Forget  takes the reader on a walk through childhood, love, loss and longing. Told through memory and impressions both personal and communal, the book chronicles lifetimes through the act of walking. These journeys often follow the same paths but end in unexpected conclusions. An elephant wanders through tea estates in the Nilgiris, a woman confronts the night, prawns are tossed in chilli oil, a childhood is lost and solitude is found in fifty-five walks across cities and timelines. With gentle and insightful observations, Ganapathi offers soothing respite from the chaos of our cities and the clamour of our thoughts. About the speakers: Meera Ganapathi  is a former advertising professional, and the founder and editor of the literary and arts publication, The Soup. She has written various books for children, like  THE GIRL WHO COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING, UMA VS UPMA, A FRIEND FOR POOCHI  and  PAATI VS UNCLE .  Her poems and short stories have appeared in several anthologies, including,  CAT PEOPLE  and  A CASE OF INDIAN MARVELS: DAZZLING SHORT STORIES BY INDIA'S FINEST WRITERS . Meera lives in Goa with her baby, her partner and her misunderstood cat, Apple. Moderating the session is  Joshua Muyiwa , a Bangalore-based poet and freelance writer, editor and columnist. He has written for publications like The Week, Tehelka, Bangalore Mirror, Firstpost, Mint Lounge, Conde Nast Traveller, and the Hindu Business Line amongst others. His poems have appeared in  POETRY WITH PRAKRITI, THE WORLD THAT BELONGS TO US: AN ANTHOLOGY OF QUEER POETRY FROM SOUTH ASIA  and  elsewhere. He is always looking for different ways to present, perform, and play with his poems.\u00a0",
