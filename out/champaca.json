    "description": "Join us at the bookstore to tune into this conversation between Vanamala Viswanatha and Anjum Hasan as they discuss Kuvempu's Epic Novel (Penguin's Modern Classics Series, 2024)  BRIDE IN THE HILLS.\u00a0 Here are the details of the event-\u00a0 DAY- Saturday DATE- 15th February\u00a0 TIME- 5:30 PM Please  RSVP here  to confirm your presence.\u00a0 BRIDE IN THE HILLS   tells the love stories of young men and women aspiring for a life of freedom, dignity and fulfilment in marriage within a caste-ridden social order. Kuvempu's multi-centred text, with its organic weave of varied narrative strands, much like the Mahabharata, is epic in substance and style. The novel, which is rooted in the regional realities of Malnad, is yet another example of the diversity of modern Indian literature. This epic novel with the sweep of a Tolstoy classic enacts its mission statement: 'Here, nobody is important; nobody is unimportant; nothing is insignificant!' with brilliance, energy and imaginative power.
