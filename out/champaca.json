A mentee at the Asian Women Writers programme, her poetry, short fiction and essays have been published in numerous literary journals and an anthology at Oxford University. Deepthi Talwar is the executive editor at @penguinrandomhouseindia\u00a0 About the book: A scholarly loner and a musical prodigy come to India for answers, over twenty years apart\u2026 In 1995, thirty-six-year-old Will arrives in newly liberalized India. Smarting from the collapse of his academic dreams, he finds little fulfilment in his well-paying telecommunications job or the social confines of New Delhi\u2019s expat community. One monsoon night, he encounters young, enigmatic Leela, who blazes into his world and unleashes a storm of passion and devastation that will alter it forever. Twenty-three years later, Aria lands in the city on a quest to find the mother whom she believed to be dead. Estranged from her convalescing father, her journey leads her to unravel the mysteries of her parents\u2019 story and her mother\u2019s life\u2014from her childhood in an orphanage to a doomed love affair and finally, the remote shores of asceticism. As she searches for answers and a sense of belonging, Aria stumbles upon lost worlds, haunting memories, and the explosive secret that torpedoed her father\u2019s life, the reverberations of which will be cataclysmic for her own. You can  RSVP  here.\u00a0 The details of the event are as follows:\u00a0 Date and time: 28 July, 6 PM\u00a0 Venue: Champaca Bookstore \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
