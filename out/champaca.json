Inviting you to experience our take on Secret Santa, where Champaca\u2019s shelves, Love Me Twice\u2019s one of a kind finds and Copper + Cloves\u2019 plant based food turn a simple festive gifting tradition into slow conversations, careful gifting and time spent in a lived bungalow with people who love books, thrift and good food as much as you do, and where you might just meet a buddy for many seasons to come.\u00a0 How it works We open with a few light icebreakers led by Radhika Timbadia from Champaca and Mridula Pai from Love Me Twice to help everyone settle in and ease into conversation. Once everyone is comfortable, the Secret Santa begins. You pick a chit, find your buddy and talk for a few minutes to get a sense of what they enjoy. Then follows the fascinating task of choosing a present for your new friend from Champaca\u2019s collection of books and an array of thrifted pieces at Love Me Twice. There is something joyful about picking a present for someone you have just met. You get to make a small, thoughtful choice for them and you also leave with a gift chosen for you.
