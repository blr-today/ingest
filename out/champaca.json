    "description": "Join Rohan Chakravarty and Menaka Raman as they discuss Rohan's latest novel SEA ICE? NOW YOU DON'T! This is the third anthology of the multi-award winning series Green humour comics. From penguins balancing their nests on thin ice to tigers basking in their own glamour whilst worrying about their future, from ghazal-loving bats to whales dumping marine plastic waste right back at us, in SEA ICE? NOW YOU DON'T! you meet an array of wild animals with their own list of concerns, and their own brand of humour. The comics will take you from the high skies to geothermal mines in the very bottom of the ocean, and from sweltering tropical mangroves to the icy poles, engaging you in discussions about ecology, biology, nature conservation, and the politics of governing nature. This is a wild ride for sure, but NOT one which needs you to leave your brains at home! SEA ICE? NOW YOU DON'T!  is the third in the series of Green Humour collections, after \u2018Green Humour for a Greying Planet\u2019 and \u2018Pugmarks and Carbon Footprints\u2019, and includes comics published in periodic columns with platforms like \u00a0 DW News , \u00a0 The Hindu , \u00a0 Roundglass Sustain , and \u00a0 Gocomics. About the speakers Rohan Chakravarty is the creator of Green Humour, a series of comics and illustrations on wildlife and nature conservation. He lives in Nagpur where he goes on nature trails every day, led by his pet dogs Srishti and Sakshi.\u00a0 Rohan has authored seven other books, including Green Humour for a Greying Planet, Naturalist Ruddy, and Pugmarks and Carbon Footprints. Although he has won awards by UNDP, Sanctuary Asia, WWF International, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Green and Bangalore Literature Festivals for his work, a fig that once dropped out of a hornbill\u2019s mouth straight into his palm remains his most cherished prize. His worst nightmare is that the wildlife featured in his comics will read them and gang up on him for revenge some day. Menaka Raman is the author of a number of books for children including HOW TO WIN AN ELECTION (A MOST UNRELIABLE GUIDE), WHAT DO WE NAME THIS DOG and THE FREEDOM SISTERS. Her novel LOKI TAKES GUARD won the Valley of Words Award for Writing for Young Adults. She is a regular contributor to The Hindu Sunday Magazine.

    "description": "\u00a0Join us at the bookstore to tune into this conversation between V. Geetha and Thejaswi Shivanand as they discuss the books in the MAKERS series, by Tara Books. The books being discussed are A POTTER'S TALE, BOAT BUILDERS OF THE COROMANDEL and WEAVING WITH COMPASSION.\u00a0 Read on to know more about these books. A POTTER'S TALE, the first book in the series in which Ramu Velar tells us how he views his craft, vocation and life. Just as his fingers deftly mould a lump of clay to create sturdy pots and beautifully carved bowls, his memory creates sharp as well as dreamy vignettes of his journey from a village potter to a resident craftsman in a museum. Richly textured photographs and evocative illustrations bring alive the world of an unusual and introspective artisan. BOAT BUILDERS OF THE COROMANDEL tells the story of a group of craftsmen who build large wooden cargo boats with their bare hands and simple tools. Stunning on-site photographs bring alive the doing of an unusual craft that requires physical strength as well as dexterity, learnt skills as well as improvisation. A compact narrative, interspersed with the builders\u2019 views on their work, guides the reader through a startling history of making. WEAVING WITH COMPASSION\u00a0offers insight into the life and work of the Meghwal weavers of Kutch. It calls attention to the source of their creativity and the spiritual wisdom that moors them to their craft. Drawing on interviews with weavers, their reflections on their craft and labour, and onsite photographs, the book documents a century of historical change. Equally it celebrates the imagination that has sustained the weavers\u2019 craft and their social lives and relationships. The conversation will cover the stories behind each of the books, and the ones that link them together. The details of the event are as follows:\u00a0 DATE- 11 AUGUST TIME- 5:30 PM VENUE- CHAMPACA BOOKSTORE You can RSVP here to confirm your presence. About the speakers\u00a0 V.
