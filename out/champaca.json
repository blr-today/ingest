About the Book: Half Light  is set in the misty mountains of Darjeeling, a landslide entraps the guests and staff of a dilapidated hotel. Cooped up inside, two men exchange lingering glances. Four years later, their paths cross again amidst the towering skyscrapers and ghostly smog of Mumbai. Pavan has fled the hills, burying all memories of their encounter, while Neville is now a flailing graduate, craving something more than the naked torsos blowing up his phone. When he glimpses Pavan working behind the reception of a luxurious hotel, he demands a meeting, pursuing him with mischief and menace as the secrets of their time together threaten to tumble into the light. Set on the brink of India\u2019s ruling to decriminalise homosexuality,  Half Light  captures the tender, richly atmospheric and elegantly wry story of outlawed desire and the hope of a life beyond concealment.
