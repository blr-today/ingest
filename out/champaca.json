    "description": "This January, join us at our Indiranagar store for a sensory storytelling session inspired by  Rain Perfume  by Niveditha Reddy, illustrated by Shubshree Mathur. Children will step into Boondi\u2019s world of rain, Thatha, and that familiar wet-earth smell many of us love. As they listen to the story of how Boondi finds a way to share the joy of the first rain with her grandfather, they\u2019ll move like rain-loving creatures, solve small puzzles, play with the sounds of thunder and raindrops, and respond to the monsoon through simple art activities. Date:  Saturday, 10 January 2026   Time:  11:00 AM onwards   Venue:  Champaca Bookstore, Indiranagar   Age group:  4\u20138 years Rain Perfum , published by Kalpavriksh, follows Boondi, a little girl who adores the smell of rain and wants to share it with her bedridden Thatha. It\u2019s a gentle story about love, intergenerational bonds, and noticing the quiet but powerful changes nature brings with the monsoon. The book captures the scent of wet soil, small family rituals around rain, and the way children often notice what adults overlook. At the event, children will hear the story read aloud and then explore its ideas through play, art, and conversation. Niveditha is an engineer-turned-writer who discovered her love for storytelling while spinning tales for her young son. Inspired by her travels and everyday encounters, she writes regularly for children\u2019s magazines across genres, with stories that help young readers connect with themselves and the world around them.

    "description": "We are delighted to host the launch of \u00a0 India Street Lettering: A Journey Through Typographic Craft & Culture \u00a0 by typeface designer and lettering artist \u00a0 Pooja Saxena , in conversation with design historian and graphic designer \u00a0 Nia Thandapani ,   at Champaca Vasanthnagar. Drawing from over a decade of documentation and research, \u00a0 India Street Lettering \u00a0 is a 200-page hardcover, full-colour book that showcases striking public lettering from across Indian cities in paint, relief, mosaic, neon, wood and more. It brings together photographs, essays and interviews that trace how shopfronts, hand-painted signs and vernacular letterforms tell stories about language, labour, design and everyday life in India\u2019s streets. At Champaca, Pooja and Nia will talk about building this archive of signs, the collaborations and fieldwork that shaped the book, and what it means to argue for street lettering as part of the design canon. The evening will also explore the politics of the urban visual landscape, questions of preservation in the age of vinyl and digital printing, and how designers might learn from the ingenuity of sign painters and local lettering traditions. Date: \u00a0 January 17, 2026, Saturday Time: \u00a0 6:00 PM onwards Venue: \u00a0 Champaca Bookstore, Vasanth Nagar Champaca is only accessible through stairs. Pooja Saxena \u00a0 is a typeface designer, lettering artist and typographer whose work often focuses on Indic scripts and locally rooted typographic cultures.

Nia Thandapani \u00a0 is an independent design historian and practising graphic designer and book maker based in Bangalore. Her work spans colonial and post-independence design history in India and the United Kingdom, with a focus on how questions of power, coloniality and public memory play out in museums, heritage spaces and design practice today.

    "description": "Champaca is excited to host\u00a0 Book Screenings , a workshop that brings together books and films to think about how stories build the places we inhabit. Three cities, one afternoon of watching, reading and talking about how medium shapes meaning. Book Screenings pairs three books with three films to explore the same place through different lenses. Over the course of the session, we will move between page and screen to ask how writers and filmmakers choose to show a city, a neighbourhood, a life. We will screen clips, read short excerpts and discuss how narrative choices, framing, sound and silence work alongside (or against) what the text is doing. The workshop will also touch on questions of whose stories get told, and how form itself can be political. The three pairings for this edition are: Strange Weather in Tokyo \u00a0 by Hiromi Kawakami and \u00a0 Lost in Translation \u00a0 (Japan) Roman Stories \u00a0 by Jhumpa Lahiri and \u00a0 The Bicycle Thief \u00a0 (Italy) Hour of the Star \u00a0 by Clarice Lispector and \u00a0 Hour of the Star \u00a0 (Brazil) Book Screenings is for readers, film lovers and anyone curious about how stories shape the worlds we think we know. You do not need to have read all the books or watched all the films in advance; the facilitators will guide you through key scenes and passages. Come prepared to watch closely, listen carefully and join in a relaxed, participatory conversation about medium, place and storytelling. The workshop is facilitated by \u00a0 Rahul Gautam , a director, cinematographer and acting coach with over 15 years of experience working with moving images, and \u00a0 Pallavi Prasad , a journalist, writer and editor who has spent more than a decade working with words. Together, they bring their perspectives from film and publishing into the room, opening up questions about craft, collaboration and how different mediums invite us to see the same story in new ways. Date:  Sunday, 11 January 2026 Time:  11\u201312:30 PM Venue:  Champaca Bookstore, Indiranagar Seats are limited. Please  RSVP here  to save your spot!",
