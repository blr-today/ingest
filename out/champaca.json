    "description": "We're ending the Seagull week at Champaca bookstore with a book launch and discussion of 'To Break and to Branch' by Ranjit Hoskote with Mani Rao. \u00a0The details of the event are as follows: Date- 29 June Time- 5 PM Venue- Champaca Bookstore You can  RSVP  on this link.\u00a0 \u00a0 About the\u00a0book:\u00a0 \n \n To Break and to Branch \u00a0is a collection of six essays on the artist Gieve Patel (1940\u20132023), written by poet, cultural theorist, and curator Ranjit Hoskote over nearly two decades, gathered together for the first time and accompanied by over fifty illustrations of Patel\u2019s paintings. In an introductory essay written especially for this edition, Hoskote looks back over the long friendship he shared with Patel, contextualizing it within the vibrant artistic milieu that was once special to Bombay, their home city: a milieu premised on a mutual curiosity that brought the arts together, hospitable to poetry, painting, theater, cinema, music, and architecture. \u00a0 Hoskote\u2019s writings trace both the constant preoccupations and the changing interests that gave Patel\u2019s art its distinctive character and reflect on the aesthetic, philosophical, and political dimensions of Patel\u2019s gradual movement from a human-centric understanding of the world to a more holistic view as generated and sustained by interrelationships across orders of being. \n \n",

    "description": "The second event of our Seagull week is a\u00a0 book launch and discussion of Chitvan Gill's 'Dreaming a Paradise: The Story of Buland Masjid' with Sushmita Pati. \n \u00a0 \n About the book: \n \n In\u00a0 Dreaming a Paradise , Chitvan Gill draws on years of research and photographic reportage to unveil the tales of individuals driven to escape poverty, violence, and despair in search of happiness and a place to call home. At the heart of this book lies Buland Masjid, an unauthorized colony on the Yamuna riverbank in Delhi, India, which thrives with restless industry even under the unyielding grip of poverty. The women and men of this colony recycle scrap, repair machines, manufacture clothes, run schools, and sell delicious food, breathing new energy into a once-desolate economy. However, beneath the surface lies a tale of urban planning gone awry, reflecting the comprehensive failure of those in power. Delving into the lives of those cast aside and walled off from India\u2019s vast wealth, this book highlights the huge divide between modern India\u2019s haves and have-nots, and the inherent contradictions in a nation grappling with its identity. From the eternal cycles of loss and discovery, we witness the formation of civilizations and the timeless yearning that defines the human condition. \n \n \n The details of the events are as follows: Date- 28 June Time- 5 PM Venue- Champaca Bookstore Here is the  RSVP  link.\u00a0 You can drop by at our store between 21 June - 29 June to browse through a special curation of Seagull books that include their latest launches.",
