Intoxicating, boundary-breaking love. His parents know he is gay, and their support is something Vivaan can count on, but they don\u2019t know what exactly their son gets up to in the online world. For his uncle, born thirty years earlier, things were very different. Mambro\u2019s life changed forever when he fell for a male classmate at a time, and in a country, where the persecution of gay people was rife under a colonial-era law criminalising homosexuality. And before that was Mambro\u2019s uncle Sukumar, a young man hopelessly in love with another young man, but forced by social taboos to keep their relationship a secret at all costs. Sukumar would never live the life he yearned for, but his story would ignite and inspire his nephew and grand-nephew after him. Bold and bracing, intimate and heartbreaking,\u00a0 DEVIANTS \u00a0examines the histories we inherit and the legacies we leave behind. \n \n \n About the speakers\u00a0 Santanu Bhattacharya\u00a0 grew up in India, and studied at the University of Oxford and the National University of Singapore.
