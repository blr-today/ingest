    "description": "Join us at the bookstore to tune into this conversation between Nusrat Jafri and Thejaswi Shivanand as they discuss THIS LAND WE CALL HOME.\u00a0 THIS LAND WE CALL HOME  is Nusrat F. Jafri's debut non fiction book. It traces her maternal family history, through the lens of caste and conversions and the making of modern India. Here are the details of the event-\u00a0 DATE- 9 NOVEMBER\u00a0 TIME- 6 PM\u00a0 VENUE- CHAMPACA BOOKSTORE Please  RSVP \u00a0here since there is limited seating for the event.\u00a0 Read on to know more about the book and the speakers.\u00a0 About the book\u00a0 In this book Nusrat F. Jafri traces the roots of her nomadic forebears through the lens of caste and religious conversions over the last century. This affecting memoir explores religious and multicultural identities and delves into the profound concepts of nation-building and belonging. Nusrat\u2019s family\u2019s conversion to Christianity as a response to Brahmanical gatekeeping highlights their struggle for acceptance. The family found acceptance in the church, alongside a sense of community, theology, songs and carnivals, and quality education for the children in missionary schools. Parallelly, we see the family\u2019s experiences during Gandhi\u2019s return in 1915, the Partition, the two World Wars, the Emergency and the prime ministers\u2019 assassinations. In a way, this is a story like and unlike the stories all of us carry within us; the inherited weight of who we are and where we come from, our tiny little freedoms and our everyday struggles and, mostly, the intricate jumble of our collective ancestry. Nusrat pays homages to her foremothers, the first feminists, and her forefathers, the ones who tried hard to fit into a caste society only to be spat out, and eventually chose alternative faiths in pursuit of acceptance. About the speakers\u00a0 Nusrat F Jafri , is a Mumbai based cinematographer, with twenty years of experience in filmmaking.
