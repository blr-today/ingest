About the Book: About the Friend in My Heart  gently introduces children to the idea of kindness as something that already lives within them. Through simple questions and a tender narrative, the book invites young readers to notice their feelings, nurture empathy, and listen to their inner world. It encourages children to open their hearts, stay curious, and recognise kindness in themselves and others. About the Author: Dipna is a Mumbai-based movement artist, early years educator, yoga practitioner, and founder of Move with Joy - a creative movement program for young children that celebrates the body, imagination, and joy of expression. She is also the co-founder of Love the World Today, a sustainable clothing brand that creates thoughtful clothing for children. With over 17 years of experience in early childhood education and more than a decade in contemporary dance and dance-theatre, Dipna's work is grounded in the belief that kindness, curiosity, and imagination are essential to learning, creating, and growing. Whether in classrooms, studios, or on stage, her approach centers on keeping the inner child alive - through presence, play, and listening deeply to the body and the world around it.",

Deepika Arwind  is an award-winning writer and playwright whose work has been produced on many continents.  Good Argumnets  is her debut novel. She divides her time between Berlin and Bangalore. she always wanted to say that but now that she actually does, she realises it\u2019s a far more exhausting predicament that she thought it would be. She thinks that in general bios should be funnier and finds Sharanya\u2019s preferable to her own.\u00a0 Sharanya tells  people she's a theatre maker but she's not. She's a theatre breaker. She's a bored housewife in Basavanagudi drinking single malt whiskey in steel tumblers. She has fascinating insights on idli dose and monogamy. She made a show with Deepika in 2018 called \u2018I am not here: an 8-step guide on how to censor women\u2019s writing\u2019. And here she is in conversation about writing and theatre with her.",
