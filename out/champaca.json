    "description": "Join us at Champaca Bookstore, Indiranagar for\u00a0 Stories at Play , a hands-on Story-Building workshop in collaboration with  Project DEFY . This session invites readers of all ages to spend a slow morning with stories, reading together, thinking aloud, and creating something new. It\u2019s designed for anyone curious about how stories shape learning, imagination, and connection, without needing any prior writing or teaching experience. What to expect Participants will work in small mixed-age groups, reading a curated children\u2019s book together and using it as a starting point to imagine new characters, worlds, and stories. Through simple prompts, each group will build a short, handmade children\u2019s book. The session ends with a shared reflection on reading, learning, and what it feels like to build stories together. Stories at Play: Champaca x Project DEFY Date:  Saturday, 14 February Time:  11 AM onwards Venue:  Champaca Bookstore, Indiranagar Open to adults, children, families, educators, and anyone interested in stories and learning. For over a decade, Project DEFY has been working with communities to run learning spaces called Nooks, challenging conventional ideas of education and placing curiosity, agency, and collaboration at the centre of learning, for children and adults alike. The workshop is facilitated by  Radhika Ravikumar , who manages partnerships at Project DEFY. With close to seven years of experience in the social impact space, her work focuses on reimagining learning as creative, relational, and deeply human. A lifelong reader, she brings her love for stories and conversation into the way she facilitates learning. Seats are limited. We request you to  REGISTER HERE  to confirm your spot.
