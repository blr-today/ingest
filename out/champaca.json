    "description": "Join us at the bookstore to tune into this conversation between Lavanya Lakshminarayan and\u00a0Shrabonti Bagchi as they discuss Lavanya's latest science-fiction novel,  INTERSTELLAR MEGACHEF.\u00a0 The event details are as follows:\u00a0 DATE: 23 NOVEMBER, SATURDAY TIME: 5 PM VENUE: CHAMPACA BOOKSTORE\u00a0 Since there is limited seating, we recommend you to\u00a0\u00a0 RSVP \u00a0here to confirm your presence!\u00a0 About the book Stepping off a long-haul star freighter from Earth, Saras Kaveri has one bag of clothes, her little flying robot Kili... and an invitation to compete in the galaxy's most watched, most prestigious cooking show.\u00a0 Interstellar MegaChef \u00a0is the showcase of the planet Primus's austere, carefully synthesised cuisine. No one from Earth where they're so incredibly primitive they still cook with\u00a0 fire \u00a0 has ever graced its flowmetal cookstations before, or smiled awkwardly for its buzzing drone-cams. Until now. Corporate prodigy Serenity Ko, inventor of the smash-hit sim SoundSpace, has just got messily drunk at a floating bar, narrowly escaped an angry mob and been put on two weeks' mandatory leave to rest and get her work-life balance back. Perfect time to start a new project! And she's got just the idea: a sim for\u00a0 food. \u00a0Now she just needs someone to teach her how to cook. A chance meeting in the back of a flying cab has Saras and Serenity Ko working together on a new technology that could change the future of food--and both their lives forever!
