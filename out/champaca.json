    "description": "Join us at Champaca Bookstore in Vasanth Nagar for a conversation on\u00a0 FOR NO REASON AT ALL , the latest book by  Ramjee Chandran , in conversation with writer and editor Shinie Anthony. An evening of storytelling and behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the making of a book that blends satire, suspense, and political drama. Event Details: Date:   Saturday, 24 May 2025 Time: \u00a0 5:30 PM Venue:   Champaca Bookstore, Vasanth Nagar Since there is limited seating, we recommend you  book your spot soon . About the book: Set in New Delhi in the 1980s,  FOR NO REASON AT ALL  is based on true events. When a young Prime Minister is faced with a decision that could shape the future of Indian innovation, a storm brews around the local production of silicon metal. As corporate lobbying, foreign interference, and government ambition collide, a web of espionage, deception, and unexpected humour emerges. At the centre of it all is Solly Nilla, a sharp and adroit lobbyist, navigating diplomatic pressure, political power plays, and the chaos of a fast-changing world. With its blend of suspense and sharp social commentary, the novel offers both a thrilling plot and a wry reflection on bureaucracy, ambition, and absurdity.
