    "description": "How do images of divinity, democracy, and authority circulate, collide, and enact symbolic violence?\n\n\nIn Pain Corporation of India, Bharathesh G D examines these questions through a series of ideas/works that function as meaning-making machines\u2014only to turn against themselves. The works expose how belief is engineered, pain normalised, and dissent absorbed, deferred, and managed within visual culture.\n\n\nThis project does not operate in the register of nostalgia. It begins with a refusal. Rather than offering solace or resolution, the works mimic the visual systems they seek to\ndismantle\u2014borrowing their scale, materials, and repetitive logic to generate friction instead of\naffirmation. Images fracture rather than reassure. Meaning is not delivered; it is interrupted.\nWhat emerges is a visual grammar of interruption, where symbols refuse to settle, and\nperception is kept deliberately unstable.\n\n\nShaped by decades of accumulated pain\u2014socially produced, politically administered, and\ncollectively endured under the promise of democracy\u2014this body of work reflects a condition of\nmass anguish and helplessness. Here, dissent survives only through indirect speech: metaphor,\nsign, code. Multiple voices echo, trapped within the factory of images\u2014an apparatus of visual\nproduction that endlessly manufactures meaning, flattens complexity, and converts plural\nrealities into singular opinions.\n\n\nPain Corporation of India reveals democracy not as an absence, but as an infrastructure:\noperational, procedural, and capable of sustaining suffering while appearing functional. The\nworks insist on looking at pain not as an exception, but as a product\u2014systematically generated,\ncirculated, and consumed."
