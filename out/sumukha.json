    "description": "Cop Shiva (Shivaraju BS) has always been fascinated by the characters roaming around our world. He has an alert eye that knows who among us produces, performs and plays on the daily. He delights in presenting these characters in the process of becoming but also patiently waits for their final form to emerge. He shifts between doubling-down by fixing them within their context or freeing them from it. He doesn\u2019t always get his results with a velvet glove \u2013 but he has always earned that intimacy with his subjects.\n\nIn his latest work \u2013 No Longer A Memory, a photo-performance series with his mother Gowramma, Cop Shiva becomes a character too. \n\nOn recently returning to his village to live with her \u2013 in a new house Cop Shiva has built for her, he realised they don\u2019t have \u201ca single photograph of us together\u201d. No Longer A Memory, a photo-performance series, honours his childhood days spent playing with his mother Gowramma. Slipping between the roles of gods and goddesses, film heroes and heroines, cops and robbers or a benevolent royal couple \u2013 costumes and props fashioned from humble household objects or their colourful imaginations. No Longer A Memory makes real those fantasies from their past.",
