    "description": "Can you imagine the courage of a young woman in early 20th century India travelling across the country, just to explore and study traditional arts and craft methods and communities? That\u2019s exactly what Meera Mukherjee, one of the most prolific sculptors of late 20th century India, did.\n\nJoin Tapati Guha-Thakurta for a talk on her recently published centenary volume on Meera Mukherjee \u2014 From the Depth of the Mould.\nUsing a translated phrase from the artist's own writings, From the Depth of the Mould, it will use the metaphor of Meera Mukherjee\u2019s elaborate mould-making and metal casting process, and look closely at the themes of material and technique, labour and work, struggle and resilience in her life story.",

    "description": "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, a Sanskrit phrase meaning \u201cthe world is family\u201d, is a universalist idea that competes with dominant, exclusivist Hindu notions of caste. The director of the film, Anand Patwardhan, grew up in a milieu that questioned the latter. The family\u2019s elders had fought for India\u2019s Independence, but had rarely spoken about it. \u2018Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\u2019, words enshrined in India\u2019s Constitution, were subconsciously internalised.\n\nAs his parents aged, Anand began to film with whatever equipment was at hand. Soon, birthdays and family gatherings gave way to oral history. Revisiting home movie footage a decade after his parents had passed, was a revelation. Today, supremacist ideology has plagued and altered notions of democracy. As they rewrite India\u2019s history, memories of the past and the lessons they present us with have become more precious than mere personal nostalgia.\n\nJoin us for a screening of this award-winning documentary followed by a Q&amp;A with the filmmaker.\n\nCredits:\n\n- Production, Direction, Editing: Anand Patwardhan\n- Camera and Sound: Anand Patwardhan, Simantini Dhuru\n- Production Assistance: Simantini Dhuru, Mohosin Shaikh",
