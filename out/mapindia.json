    "description": "Do you want to explore the duality of newness that comes from going back to something old?\n\nReplaced largely by technology, paper has become as if something from times past. In this drop in, live performance session, you can walk in and participate with artist Smitha Cariappa to create an experience for yourself.\u00a0\n\nThe artist will be seated partially blindfolded at the gallery, waiting for visitors to come and relay a message. She will then write it down on a postcard or paper which she will then hand over to you. Through her performance, the artist in tandem with visitors will attempt to reflect on socio-cultural gaps and misconceptions.\n\n",
