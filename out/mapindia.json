    "description": "Photo credits: Manu Rewal\nMAP presents two documentaries by filmmaker Manu Rewal that explore how architecture, landscape, and cultural histories come together in shaping two iconic Indian cities.\n\nMandu, the City of Joy (1996) offers a portrait of the 15th-century hilltop capital where water systems, terrain, and architecture merge in inventive ways. Through miniature paintings and architectural reflections, the film reveals Mandu\u2019s distinctive synthesis of Hindu and Muslim artistic traditions.\n\nUdaipur, a Romance with Nature (1997) traces how the city\u2019s palaces, lakes, and urban form evolved in response to climate and geography. Set in the 16th and 17th centuries, the film highlights Udaipur\u2019s enduring dialogue between architecture and nature, and its influence on later aesthetic visions.\n\nFollowing the screening, join us for a Q&amp;A with writer and director Manu Rewal, offering deeper insights into his research, process, and the making of these films.",
