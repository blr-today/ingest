    "description": "Join us for an artist talk by Labani Jangi, the recipient of the T.M. Krishna-PARI prize that honours individuals who bridge the worlds of art and journalism. Labani is a research scholar and cultural practitioner from Nadia in West Bengal who explores a layered tapestry of inquiry through her practice\u2013observing the currents of resistance and identity formation beyond protected ignorance as they unfold in the world around her.\u00a0\n\nDrawing from her daily realities as a Muslim woman in India, Labani\u2019s works are deeply rooted in lived experiences, reflecting the fractures and solidarities of a world where subaltern voices are systematically invisibilised or romanticised. Her practice draws inspiration from forms like the Jari Gaan\u2013a centuries-old song tradition from the Bengal region based on the legends of Karbala. The thematic concerns of her work strive to fight cultural homogenisation and erase threats to pluralism by focusing on sites that expose us to historical and ongoing oppressions in relation to each other\u2013acting as a vital bridge that exposes a lineage of survival and expression for minority communities in the region.\n\nIn this session, the artist will explore three series of works inspired by different sources: a poem by Palestinian poet Tawfiq Ziad, the poem Chambal Ek Nadi by poet and filmmaker Naresh Saxena, and the legend of Hijrat.\u00a0Labani will be in conversation with Soumydeep Dasgupta from MAP\u2019s Education team.\n\nThis talk will mostly be in Hindi with occasional switches to Bangla which will be translated by the interlocutor.\n\nThis event is part of VISIBLE/INVISIBLE:Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection exhibition programming.",

    "description": "In this workshop, Mara Oscar Cassiani invites participants to engage in a collective experience that merges digital and physical realms, exploring how algorithms typically used to shape online content and interactions can be repurposed as prompts for rituals to create moments of shared reflection and connection.\n\nAt the heart of the workshop is a series of gifs and memes created by the artist herself, and presented as tarot cards inspired by ritual female archetypes\u2014universal symbols that evoke shared narratives and collective identities. These digital elements act as catalysts for group rituals that move fluidly between augmented reality and real-life interactions.\u00a0\n\nThe workshop draws on Mara Oscar Cassiani\u2019s research into 'expanded rituals'\u2014rituals that emerge from the algorithmic bubbles shaping our online experiences. These bubbles generate personalised digital environments through suggested content. The artist explores how traditional rituals, often linked to specific cultural and social practices, are being reshaped and influenced by these algorithmic currents on the internet.\n\nThis workshop offers a participatory experience where digital art and ritual converge, revealing how technology shapes our shared human stories. Participants will explore how algorithmic influences extend beyond the screen, evolving into tangible and communal practices.\n\nNotes for the participants: The workshop involves light physical activity. Please wear comfortable sneakers and sportswear, and bring a mat to sit on if desired.",

    "description": "Are your devices listening to you? This question, while often dismissed as an urban myth, has deeply influenced how we perceive and interact with algorithmic systems. The artist uses this ambiguity as a starting point for a collective experiment in which participants are encouraged to disrupt their phones\u2019 usual flow of suggested content, rewriting their algorithmic realities to explore new narratives and potential futures.\n\nIn this workshop, artist and social designer Ginevra Petrozzi invites participants to explore the intersection of magical thinking and surveillance technologies. She draws inspiration from Italy\u2019s folkloric traditions and heritage, reviving knowledge that was preserved in secret and passed down clandestinely through generations of women.\u00a0\n\nCentral to the workshop is the collaborative creation of a \"Perfect Futures\" script\u2014an exercise in crafting counter-narratives that stand in contrast to the prepackaged stories curated by our devices. Participants will work with Petrozzi to transform these scripts into a form of digital enchantment, playfully subverting the predictive logic of algorithms through whispered incantations. The workshop will culminate in a collective performance, where the \"Perfect Futures\" are recited as a \u201cspell\u201d into participants\u2019 devices, mirroring a popular TikTok trend that involves whispering keywords and phrases into an unguarded phone to influence its algorithm.\n\nIn this participatory experience, the artist encourages participants to rethink their relationship with technology, experimenting with the idea that language and intention might hold the power to enchant not only the digital sphere but also our collective futures.\n\nRegistrations for this event are closed.",
