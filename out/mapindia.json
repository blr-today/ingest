    "description": "From dancing elephants and beloved deities, to the surprising sight of steamships, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery.\n\nTextile labels arrived in Indian markets in the thousands, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India), and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire, memory, and meaning into the act of purchase.\u00a0\n\nOur latest exhibition, Ticket Tika Chaap, explores these textile labels, and their art-historical and commercial significance, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement, in India. Join us for an exciting walkthrough of Ticket, Tika, Chaap with artist and printmaker Jayasimha Chandrasekhar where he shares his unique insights as a printmaker. This will be followed by an in-depth presentation on the same.",

It brings together a deaf performer with non-sign language artists from various fields, including filmmaking, painting, and design, to craft a language beyond speech.\n\nIt blends personal, playful pop culture elements, examining the diverse ways we communicate our stories. At a time where words are excessively used as rhetoric by authoritarian figures, this show asks if we can find a more humane, collective voice.\n\nCredits:\n\nConceived and directed by: Anuja Ghosalkar\nCreated and performed by: Amaldev PR, Bhavana Rajendran, Gavati Wad, Nidhi Mariam Jacob\nAssistant Direction: Gavati Wad\nTechnical Design: Aliasger Dhariwala\nLight Design: Vikrant Thakar\nLight Execution: Akshay Khaire\n\nThis performance is part of the Beyond Theory: Continuing the Work conference happening on 25th and 26th April.",

Join us for a performance by Dominique Savitri Bonarjee as she presents \"How to Dream a Rasa Machine,\" a sensuous journey into sound, movement, and the subtle energies of our world. Structured as an electrifying jam session, blending electronic and acoustic textures with embodied dance, this performance is deeply inspired by the intricacies of Indian rasa. At its heart lies a handcrafted copper sound suit, a revolutionary instrument that translates the performer\u2019s every motion and environmental nuances \u2013 gravity, air, humidity \u2013 into a rich sonic landscape.\n\nIn Indian aesthetics, rasa refers to the spiritual pleasure of deep immersion in experience. Here, the audience encounters rasa through the sensuous materiality of the instrument, and a spectral soundscape that induces a collective dream-space.\u00a0\n\nThis is followed by \u2018Butoh, as Heard by a Dancer\u2019, book presentation.",

Here, employing a feminist lens means that their practices expose power hierarchies framed by factors including but not limited to gender\u2013 like caste, race, sex, sexuality and more.\n\nThe first iteration of the conference looked at practice and the second at the infrastructure that enabled those practices. Each panel in both the conferences could stand alone, but was bound by a common way of seeing and understanding\u2013how can feminist practices help carve out a less precarious, sustainable and just sector for us? How has it done it before in pockets and niches? How does it continue to do it and how could we scale or replicate it in meaningful ways?\n\nFor the concluding conference, we want to take stock of where we are. Reflecting on the three years of work and conversations we have had under the conference and the permanent exhibition, this year\u2019s iteration will be a sweep\u2013its aim, not to mark success but to be honest about the lay of the land. Since speaking of various concerns\u2013of representation, of precarity, of a crisis of care, of lack of funding, of impunity, of inaccessibility, and exclusion\u2013on a micro level, at this conference, and on a macro level, at many more forums\u2013what have been the shifts and silences that have gotten us here \u2013for better or for worse?\n\nAs we mark the last year of the exhibition, we want to gather artists, art workers, writers, academics and institutions to reflect on the evolution of their work in the sector, speak to each other regarding doubt, success and failure and look back at the blueprints of our work.\n\nFor any queries, please reach out to visible@map-india.org\n\nPlease note: This conference is free to attend.
