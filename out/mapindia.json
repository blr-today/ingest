    "description": "Join us for a walkthrough of our permanent exhibition with Senior Archivist from the Archives at NCBS, Anjali Ramachandran.\n\nWhen we encounter artworks at a museum, we make meaning either through the work itself, its setting, or through labels that accompany them. Another way to read an artwork is to look for what's not in the 'frame'\u2014to explore the circumstances of its creation and the use of the artwork, rather than just the artwork itself.\n\nIn this guided walk, you will get to explore our permanent exhibition, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women through the MAP Collection, through the lens of an archivist. We will discuss the maker, the purpose, a specific object's relation to others, and the broader social and historical environment in which the artworks were created. In archival sciences, this is called contextualisation, where archivists understand records through the varied ways in which memories (remembered or in recorded acts) have been transmitted over time and space with numerous inscriptions, transmissions, and omissions.\n\nAlthough it sounds technical, the process itself can be disruptive and playful. It involves gossip, peeking behind the curtain, and an understanding of the complex process of making art!",
