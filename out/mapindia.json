    "description": "If you've wandered through our vibrant Ticket Tika Chaap\u00a0exhibition, you'll know that colour and design aren't just pretty additions, they're at the very heart of the experience. But what role does design really play in bringing an exhibition to life? Is it a factor to be considered from the start or an afterthought once the exhibition is up?\n\nFind out the answers to these questions and more, at the upcoming Tuesday Tidbits led by Cibal Prems from the MAP Design team.\n\nTuesday Tidbits is a series that explores different aspects of working in a museum through the lens of our team members. Join us for these free, insightful, and short sessions on life in a museum.\n\nThis is part of our series that seeks to support youth in career research/building and acts as a space for networking for young people.",
