    "description": "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, a Sanskrit phrase meaning \u201cthe world is family\u201d, is a universalist idea that competes with dominant, exclusivist Hindu notions of caste. The director of the film, Anand Patwardhan, grew up in a milieu that questioned the latter. The family\u2019s elders had fought for India\u2019s Independence, but had rarely spoken about it. \u2018Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\u2019, words enshrined in India\u2019s Constitution, were subconsciously internalised.\n\nAs his parents aged, Anand began to film with whatever equipment was at hand. Soon, birthdays and family gatherings gave way to oral history. Revisiting home movie footage a decade after his parents had passed, was a revelation. Today, supremacist ideology has plagued and altered notions of democracy. As they rewrite India\u2019s history, memories of the past and the lessons they present us with have become more precious than mere personal nostalgia.\n\nJoin us for a screening of this award-winning documentary followed by a Q&amp;A with the filmmaker.\n\nCredits:\n\n- Production, Direction, Editing: Anand Patwardhan\n- Camera and Sound: Anand Patwardhan, Simantini Dhuru\n- Production Assistance: Simantini Dhuru, Mohosin Shaikh",

    "description": "Do you ever feel alone, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection, even when it cracks a little? This is a performance piece that explores loneliness.\n\nThe Earthquake tells the story of two people. In their story, the meaning of human connection, loneliness, and unspoken words hang heavy in the air.\n\nMathew and Sameer meet every week, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. Yet, the unspoken words scream louder than their spoken conversations. This story of cycles, of coming together, drifting apart, and all the spaces in between, is an adaptation of \u201cBh\u016bmikampa \u2013 Das Erdbeben\u201d which received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt M\u00fcnchen Kulturreferat (City of Munich).",
