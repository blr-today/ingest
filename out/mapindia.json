    "description": "Image Credits: Tram Theatre Trust\n\nDig your hands into clay, and craft your own clay dolls! Come over to MAP, spend time exchanging stories and experiences with professional clay doll artists from the Sunderbans, and learn more about this indigenous craft form.\n\nHandmade dolls, particularly clay doll-making, have a deep relevance in human life. They strengthen connections with the natural and social environment, reinforce relationships, impart values and skills, fire the creative gene, and build a kinship between the mundane, the mythical and the spiritual. This practice is a deeply relaxing and therapeutic process.\n\nExplore this historic craft form in this guided clay-doll making workshop with Dinesh Mondal and Ranajeet Sarkar from Manmathanagar. Generational and first-generation artists here create dolls that depict everything from fierce man-eating creatures of the Sunderbans, everyday lives of their people, to episodes from local folk-legends like Bonbibi and DokkhinRai. Become a part of this rich world, and take home your own Sunderbans clay doll!\n\nPlease note: There are two sessions of this workshop. Please choose the session you want to attend on the registration link at the top of the page. Here are the dates and timings of the sessions:\n\n- Saturday, July 5 (10:00 am - 1:00pm)\n\n- Sunday, July 6 (10:00 am - 1:00pm)",

While the display mainly highlights one-of-a-kind hand-pressed clay dolls and some other variations, the region has had a rich history of dolls being made from almost every natural material \u2014from seeds, leaves and wood, to metal, glass, fabric, and more. The makers\u2019 of these artefacts were not just limited to individual artists, but included families and even entire villages or communities, each with their own creative expression and heritage.\n\nKnown as putul in Bengali, these dolls not only serve as objects of play, worship and decoration, but also as bearers of stories. They carry their makers\u2019 beliefs, histories, cultural knowledge and reflections of their everyday lives.\n\nJoin us to discover the unique history of these objects and the rich stories they tell.\n\nPutul Katha is accompanied by the following events:\n- Clay Doll-Making with Sunderbans Doll Artists\n- Maati Katha (Earth Stories) \u2013 An Object &amp; Material Theatre Performance\n\nThis showcase is based on ongoing research by the Tram Arts Trust on the stories surrounding the doll arts of West Bengal.",

We will engage with a range of materials to think about preservation both practically and politically.\n\nOrganisation\n- How does the structure of memory storage shape how it is understood? We\u2019ll reflect on different archival logics and the possibilities of queering archival organisation\n\nAccess\n- How do we dream through the archive?

In this dangerous and magical land, living is about a fragile balance between land and water, forest and field, domestic and wild, human and human, human and non-human, calm and storm. As each stakes claim, as each encroaches upon the other\u2019s space, how does life manage to thrive?\n\nStories and beliefs form essential anchors for the people of the Sunderbans, with the \u2018Bonbibi\u2019 legend looming large in the popular imagination. Bonbibi is said to have come to the \u2018Land of the 18 Tides\u2019 to help the people, the tigers, the deer, the crabs, the trees\u2014all beings that cohabit the land. But, only if we agree to the land's terms. And when she looks away, devastation follows! Episodes from this legend, as well as everyday aspects of Sunderbans life, are depicted by the traditional and contemporary doll-makers of Sunderbans.\n\nMaati Katha (Earth Stories) brings these dolls\u2014originally used for worship, child\u2019s play and display\u2014into the theatre for the first time, combining these art and craft traditions with contemporary object and material theatre practices. The play brings alive the Sunderbans through these clay dolls and the shape-shifting \u2018maati\u2019 (clay, mud, soil, earth, land), that not only forms the dolls, but also defines the land and grounds the philosophy of the region. In doing so, Maati Katha invites us to celebrate human resilience in the midst of fragility\u2014a resilience that enables diverse communities to hold together through repeated upheavals of natural calamity and human violence. Bonbibi\u2019s philosophy reigns, \u201cYou are all connected: the crocodile, the tiger, water, forest, land, all human beings \u2026 All!\u201d\n\n&nbsp;",
