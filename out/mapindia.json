    "description": "Join us for a delightful talk that unravels the enchanting world of \u2018Colchas,\u2019 exquisite embroidered textiles from the MAP collection! Colchas are decorative textiles, often characterized by elaborate embroidery or stitching, that originated in Portugal and were later embraced and transformed in Latin America. The term \"colcha\" translates to \"bedspread\" or \"coverlet,\" and these textiles were traditionally used as bed coverings or wall hangings.\u00a0\n\nGuided by textile collector Jeevak Parpia, this session promises to take you on a journey through the intricate visual storytelling that defines these extraordinary artifacts. Discover the unique motifs woven into each \u2018colcha\u2019, and their deep cultural and historical resonance.\u00a0\n\nWith his wealth of expertise, Mr. Parpia will talk on the artistic traditions and cross-cultural exchanges that shaped these textiles, tracing their roots from Portugal to Latin America, how colchas became a canvas for storytelling, reflecting the lives, beliefs, and aspirations of their makers.",

These paintings, both art and historical documents, showcase professions, societal roles, and colonial India's rigid caste and class systems and thus, offer unique insights into everyday life under colonial rule.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese delicate works, painted on thin sheets of muscovite mica from Murshidabad, Patna, and Trichinopoly, reflect the adaptation of Indian artists as royal patronage declined. They served as easily portable, attractive souvenirs for British travellers, bridging the gap between traditional miniature painting and the rise of photography.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAccompanied by Amit Dutta\u2019s short film Moments before Mutiny and an interactive game, this guided walk invites you to journey deeper into this nearly forgotten chapter of Indian art.\n\nThis guided walk will be conducted in Kannada by Rajesh K from the MAP Team.",

Known for their architectural achievements, such as grand temples, their maritime influence, and cultural contributions, the Cholas left a lasting legacy on India and the wider region.\n\nKanisetti\u2019s work brings to light the lives of not only the rulers but also the everyday people who shaped and lived through this era. Using inscriptions and historical records, he separates fact from legend, offering a nuanced view of this influential dynasty.\n\nThis book was made possible through a research grant provided to the author by the MAP Academy. The MAP Academy develops and provides open-access resources on the art and cultural histories of South Asia. Their digital offerings \u2014 including an encyclopedia of art, online courses, and several grants and special projects \u2014 encourage greater engagement with the region\u2019s visual arts.",
