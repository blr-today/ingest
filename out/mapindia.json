    "description": "Join us for a screening of Alana Hunt\u2019s film Surveilling a Crime Scene, followed by the artist in conversation with filmmaker Yashaswini Raghunandan.\n\nShot on Super 8mm film, Alana Hunt\u2019s Surveilling a Crime Scene (2023) examines the materialisation of non-Indigenous life on Miriwoong Country\u2014through the town of Kununurra and its surrounds, in the remote north-west of current-day Australia. The film aligns and overlays what may otherwise seem like discontinuous domains\u2014a dam, tourism, a historical monument, agriculture, a police station, cigarette burns, and bureaucratic forms\u2014to produce a silhouette of tools, techniques, and procedures of power and oppression. Surveilling a Crime Scene delivers a gentle yet powerful tapestry of evidence that recognises colonisation not as history but as a continuous and present violence, one that is deceptively ordinary.\n\nAlana\u2019s work is driven by lived experiences and honed through a forensic approach to research. It is shaped by relationships and often materialises through video, printed matter, photography, publishing, public events and illicit interventions. Formed by over a decade of life on Gija and Miriwoong Countries in north-west Australia, Alana\u2019s work in Australia examines contemporary colonial culture, scratching at things not commonly recognised as colonial or violent but deeply so\u2014tourism and leisure, development, legislation, and home.\n\nBeyond Australia, Alana's work in South Asia includes the iterative memorial Cups of nun chai (2010-20) published by Yaarbal Books (2020) and Paper txt msgs from Kashmir (2009-11).\n\nFollowing the screening, Alana will be in conversation with filmmaker Yashaswini Raghunandan about the making of the film and the contents of her practice at large.\n\n(Credit line: Still from Surveilling a Crime Scene, Image Courtesy: Alana Hunt)",
