    "description": "Rasas &amp; Raagas: Art inspired Melodies is an immersive and interactive workshop that invites participants to explore the deep relationship between swar (musical notes), raaga (melodic framework), and rasa (emotional essence).\u00a0\n\nWhat transforms this experience is its innovative dialogue with visual art. Participants will encounter the evocative modernist paintings of Ram Kumar, allowing his abstract forms and colors to inspire spontaneous musical responses through voice, breath, and sound.\n\nBy placing music in conversation with visual imagery, the workshop opens new pathways to experience both disciplines, designed for musicians, artists, and anyone curious about the emotive power of the arts. No prior training in music is required\u2014just a willingness to listen, respond, and discover the harmony between sound, form, and emotion.\n\nThis event is in conjunction with the exhibition,\u00a0Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.\n\nFacilitated by arts practitioners, Responding to Art through the Arts aims to activate our galleries through a series of workshops that hold space for young people\u2019s responses to artwork on display.\u00a0\n\nThis session is conducted as part of our engagements for the MAP Youth Collective. The MAP Youth Collective is a community for young people (18-25 year olds) to engage with the arts and culture sector. The collective is for, of and by young people \u2014 to explore our shared identities and interests through art.",

For this session, we\u2019ll come together to reimagine art and write letters of care and affirmation.\nWe\u2019ll begin by moving through Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar at your own pace, in your own way. As you journey through the exhibition, hold close three words of affirmation; let them sit with you, and bring them to the huddle.\n\nThrough shared exploration and queer perspectives, we\u2019ll shape those thoughts into community letters and collaborative art celebrating neuroqueer creativity and building a space where others can feel seen, safe, and held.\n\nPlease note: This is a free session exclusively for individuals who identify as LGBTQIA+ with ADHD/Autism/AuDHD.",

    "description": "Join us for the \"Art with Code\" program which introduces coding in an innovative context, teaching it through the lens of interactive art. Participants will start by learning the basics of creating art and incorporating interaction using JavaScript. This program aims to view technology not as the end goal, but as a means to create meaningful digital experiences.\n\nFacilitated by Tanvi Kumar, the program will teach participants p5.js, a JavaScript library created to teach the fundamentals of programming through art. This edition of the program will have a special theme - Ticket Tika Chaap - where participants will generate art using the ticket/chaap images that were a prominent part of the Indo-British textile trade.\n\nThis workshop is beginner-friendly, ideal for those with no coding experience as well as experienced coders.",
