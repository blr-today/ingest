    "description": "Zines have long been spaces for reflection, resistance and reclaiming stories. In this workshop with writer-illustrator Preston Olakatu, explore zine-making as a creative act of self-expression \u2014 one that holds space for personal narratives, queerness and community.\n\nThe workshop will begin with a short presentation covering the history and cultural significance of zines, tracing their roots from punk and feminist movements to present-day DIY publishing. \n\nWith an emphasis on experimentation, create your own zine exploring different formats while learning techniques such as layering, sequencing and layout structure.",

    "description": "We've all been there, finding that old family photo tucked away in a drawer, only to discover it's starting to fade, crack, or yellow. Those irreplaceable moments with loved ones, and memories captured are slowly disappearing.\nThe truth is, photographs are fragile. Heat, humidity, light, and even the way we store them can cause damage that sometimes can't be undone. But here's the good news, you don't need to be a professional to protect your photo collection!\n\nIn this talk, Chloe Lucas, a professional conservator will inform us of some preventive conservation actions that can be easily taken and implemented in a personal and private context to improve the long-term preservation of private photographic collections.",
