    "description": "How do we truly engage with art? Is it simply appreciating its aesthetic beauty, or is there more to it?\n\nThis month's Tuesday Tidbits features Shubhasree Purkayastha\u00a0from our Education and Outreach team and focuses on looking beyond the surface to foster learning experiences and make meaningful connections with art. She will focus on our latest exhibition, Chay Reds, Ferrous Black, which includes a story trail especially designed for families to use as a fun journey through the show. Discussing the behind-the-scenes process of developing this, she will highlight how the education team uses exhibitions as the foundation to drive greater creative engagement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTuesday Tidbits is a series that seeks to support youth in career research/building and acts as a space for networking for young people.",

It establishes her need to play and experiment with form and story-building, with references to her paintings, installations, performances, and works in the written word.\n\nEdited by Annapurna Garimella and Sindhura DM, with Anshika Varma as a consultant, Restless Line features essays by eleven art writers, including Adwait Singh, Amruta Patil, Dipanjali Deka, Katie Lazarowicz, Charty Dugdale, Gauri Parimoo Krishnan, Seema Bawa, Vaishnavi Ramanathan, Sona Datta, and Lina Vincent. These essays are organised into four thematic sections: The Body is her Studio, Our Myths Feed her Fantasies, Her Workshop is her Shrine, and In Continuum.\n\nBe a part of this conversation that will offer an immersive glimpse into Seema Kohli\u2019s layered creative world and the compelling insights offered in her richly composed publication.",
