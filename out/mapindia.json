    "description": "Join us for this special showcase of SPATIAL AFFAIRS - Extended Reality Experiences, a collaborative artist residency programme between MAP, HEK (House of Electronic Arts) in Basel, Switzerland, Tabakalera International Center for Contemporary Culture in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain.\n\nArtists G\u00e9raldine Honauer, Juan Ferrer, Natalia Cabrera, and \u00ccf\u1eb9\u0301ol\u00fawa \u1ecc\u0300\u1e63\u00fank\u1ecd\u0300y\u00e0, developed new XR-based projects during the six-week residencies in the summer of 2024. With the support of technology partners iart and TEKNIKER, and research partner metaLSB (at) Basel, the residency artists created site-specific installations that explore the boundaries between physical and digital spaces.\n\nSymbiotica Vol 2\nBy: Juan Ferrer and Natalia Cabrera (MAP, Bengaluru)\n\nSymbiotica vol. 2: The Webs of Coordination is an Augmented Reality interactive installation that gathers multiple players to weave symbiosis into each other and become a lichen, a pioneering organism made out of green algae, fungal mycelium, and cyanobacteria. Primarily based on the research of biologist Lynn Margulis, the work highlights the collaboration between species from different Kingdoms of life to generate a new being that performs a pioneering symbiosis. Lichens not only allowed plants and animals to populate the Earth but also emerge as a metaphoric figure for a new understanding of the \u2018individual\u2019.\n\nAgents of \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9's Quantum World\nBy: If\u1eb9\u0301ol\u00fawa \u1ecc\u0300\u1e63\u00fank\u1ecd\u0300y\u00e0 (HEK Switzerland)\n\nAgents of \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9\u2019s Quantum World (2024) is a multiplayer VR experience where participants assume the role of quantum bits (qubits), collaboratively forming a quantum circuit through their interactions. This circuit is processed, and its outcomes reshape the performer\u2019s environment. In this project, participants embody \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9, the orisha (deity) of crossroads and non-determinism, becoming creators of quantum algorithms. Like \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9, they navigate endless possibilities before making a choice. The project delves into the individual\u2019s role as an active agent in a sea of possibilities, influencing the world around them. In a society driven by hustle culture, it poses the question: what happens when the \u2018performance\u2019 of life no longer guarantees future rewards? Can insights from the orisha \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9 and If\u00e1 texts provide guidance for navigating uncertainties in emerging technologies? By extending performance beyond the stage into daily life, the project explores how quantum processing might shape the future, with our actions influencing technological progress.\n\nCurrents\nBy: G\u00e9raldine Honauer\n\nThe project \u201cCurrents\u201d focuses on an augmented reality (AR) experience that allows users to interact with live environmental data, such as air pollution and air flows, through body tracking and motion capture technologies. This AR environment aims to dynamically visualise in response to human movement, enhancing user engagement with critical environmental issues.\n\nCurrents is an immersive extended reality experience where environmental data becomes a sensory performance. Real-time CO\u2082 emissions and air flows are transformed into interactive virtual ecosystems through VR headsets. This living digital world reacts to your movement \u2014 bioluminescent plankton light up as you engage with the invisible forces around you.\n\nZWEI is supported by the \u201cFilm and Media Art\u201d committee of the Canton of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft (Switzerland).\n\nZwei (Two)\nBy: Beat Brogle &amp; iart\nAt the centre of the mixed reality work Zwei are two virtual \u201cbubbles\u201d - amorphous, algorithmically controlled beings that react in real time to their environment and the behaviour of visitors. Their behaviour is based on a structure of biological stimulus-response patterns, from which individual characteristics develop in the course of interaction. As part of a long-term media art project, Zwei explores the relationship between virtual beings and their environment \u2013 from simple algorithmic processes to the perspective of artificial intelligence.\n\nZwei is supported by the \u201cFilm and Media Art\u201d committee of the Canton of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft (Switzerland).",

    "description": "This series of talks brings together artists Manuel Beltran, Chinar Shah, Mithu Sen, and Anisha Baid, each exploring technology from a distinct vantage point.\u00a0Ranging from bio-hacking to myth-making to acts of appropriation, their practices reflect diverse ways of living in \u2014 and thinking against \u2014 a hyper-technological world. The conversation will close with a discussion on the shifting landscape of art and tech today: What does it mean to make art about technology, and what does it take to make art through it?\n\nComputer as Woman - Anisha Baid\n\nThis presentation will trace a body of work across performance, sculpture, and video that explores the feminized labor histories embedded in the computer interface. These works look at the computer as not simply a tool, but a surface of work haunted by histories of work, capital and habit. Through these works, I approach technology not as an inevitable outcome, but as a culturally and politically contingent reality\u2014shaped by specific histories, decisions, and omissions - and one that, in turn, continues to shape us and mold us - how we sit, how we talk, and how we work.\n\nScreenshots -\u00a0Chinar Shah\n\nIn this talk, I reflect on my practice as a screenshot photographer through the intertwined histories of documentary photography and family albums. As I navigate my digital life by making images, I am drawn to visual practices that are on the peripheries of networked culture\u2014images created to circulate as information but exceed their intended meaning. By situating screenshot photography within the documentary impulse, I explore how such images complicate established understandings of photographic indexicality, and how they contribute to evolving forms of image-making within the online space.\n\nHammers in the Server Room - Manuel Beltran\n\nIn this talk I will offer some thoughts about the Luddite movement to reflect upon how the current contestations we face in AI and Big Tech aren't completely new, and how they connect with similar conditions that the Luddites were challenging during the Industrial Revolution. With this in mind, and through the lens of the project Institute of Human Obsolescence (IoHO), I will present questions about the role of AI in automation, and the exploitation of data as a form of invisible labour. The IoHO stages a series of installations and interventions that propose a different framework through which to reorganise our relationship with contemporary technologies.\"\n\nDigital Un-native -\u00a0Mithu Sen\n\nI navigate the digital world with deliberate discomfort\u2014refusing fluency, embracing glitches, and reclaiming virtual space as a site of resistance, care, and feminist untranslatability.",
