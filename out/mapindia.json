    "description": "India is a land of Subaltern deities, where each deity has a unique legend and these legends are often interwoven with socio-historic tropes of India.\n\nThe Puthirai vannaar\u00a0 are a Dalit caste group known as the 'unseeable', in southern India. Their forced-occupation is to wash the clothes of other Dalits, the dead, and menstruating women. This film explores the tale of a young girl who grew up in the Puthirai vannaar caste group and how she came to be immortalised as their local deity, Maadathy.\n\nThe screening will be followed by a conversation with the director of the film, Leena Manimekalai.\n\nSupported by Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan.\n\nDo note: This is a Tamil language film and is subtitled in English.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "description": "Join us for a special Indian Sign Language interpreted walkthrough of Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar. The exhibition invites visitors to pause and reflect, observe and be inspired. Come on a journey of introspection through the mesmerising artworks and evocative letters of Ram Kumar, one of India\u2019s most renowned modernists on the occasion of his centenary year.\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by two activities that create a deeper engagement with the art on display. The Writing Table gives audiences a chance to write a letter to themselves, loved ones, strangers, or even a city through a set of prompts. Family Label facilitates an exploration of abstract art by allowing visitors to look at artworks and creating a label on what they think the artwork means, or what they see or feel when faced with an abstract artwork.\n\nShape of a Thought also features the film \u2018The Spaces in Between\u2019 by Naveed Mulki. The film explores letter exchanges between Ram Kumar and his friend and the many conversations they have on life, art and the world.",

    "description": "Come Eat With Me is a performance piece that explores the relationship between caste and food while sharing a meal together. Focusing on Dalit Cuisine, the piece begins with personal stories and oral histories around food in the performer's household and community and is peppered with existing literature and academic writing around the multilayered, many-flavoured relationships between caste and food. The piece unpacks questions of oppression and solidarity, grief and joy, and the everyday victories of the human spirit in the face of structural injustices.\n\nAudiences are invited to eat together and share their own stories around caste and food. In doing so the form subverts an activity laden with caste hierarchies and hopes to create a space for community building, and now it has sort of evolved into an event that will/has to find its place in the larger anti-caste movement, in the Ambedkarite movement.\n\nSupported by Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan\n\nImage credits: Vamsi",
