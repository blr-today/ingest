    "description": "What stories do laws tell\u2014and what stories do they silence? In this walkthrough of MAP\u2019s permanent exhibition, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection, we follow six striking artworks and artefacts that offer unexpected entry points into the world of law, justice, and feminist resistance.\n\nFrom colonial rule to contemporary protest, these pieces help us ask: Who gets to speak? Who gets seen? And what might it mean to read the law\u2014not as a set of fixed rules, but as an ongoing struggle over power, voice, and visibility?\n\nInspired by the idea that law is not just about order, but about shaping what counts as common sense, this guided walk led by lawyer Shrimoyee Nandini Ghosh, invites you to see legal history differently\u2014with curiosity, care, and imagination.\n\nImage: Citizens (Little Black Drawings series), Rajan M Krishnan, 2003, Compressed charcoal and serigraphy on handmade paper, MAC.01768",

They wove desire, memory, and meaning into the act of purchase.\u00a0\n\nJoin us for a guided walk of our latest exhibition, Ticket Tika Chaap, which explores these textile labels, known as tikats (tickets), tikas or chaaps, and their art-historical and commercial significance, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement, in India.\n\nThis guided walk will also give you FREE access to the otherwise ticketed exhibition.",
