    "description": "Join us for this special showcase of SPATIAL AFFAIRS - Extended Reality Experiences, a collaborative artist residency programme between MAP, HEK (House of Electronic Arts) in Basel, Switzerland, Tabakalera International Center for Contemporary Culture in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain.\n\nArtists G\u00e9raldine Honauer, Juan Ferrer, Natalia Cabrera, and \u00ccf\u1eb9\u0301ol\u00fawa \u1ecc\u0300\u1e63\u00fank\u1ecd\u0300y\u00e0, developed new XR-based projects during the six-week residencies in the summer of 2024. With the support of technology partners iart and TEKNIKER, and research partner metaLSB (at) Basel, the residency artists created site-specific installations that explore the boundaries between physical and digital spaces.\n\nSymbiotica Vol 2\nBy: Juan Ferrer and Natalia Cabrera (MAP, Bengaluru)\n\nSymbiotica vol. 2: The Webs of Coordination is an Augmented Reality interactive installation that gathers multiple players to weave symbiosis into each other and become a lichen, a pioneering organism made out of green algae, fungal mycelium, and cyanobacteria. Primarily based on the research of biologist Lynn Margulis, the work highlights the collaboration between species from different Kingdoms of life to generate a new being that performs a pioneering symbiosis. Lichens not only allowed plants and animals to populate the Earth but also emerge as a metaphoric figure for a new understanding of the \u2018individual\u2019.\n\nAgents of \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9's Quantum World\nBy: If\u1eb9\u0301ol\u00fawa \u1ecc\u0300\u1e63\u00fank\u1ecd\u0300y\u00e0 (HEK Switzerland)\n\nAgents of \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9\u2019s Quantum World (2024) is a multiplayer VR experience where participants assume the role of quantum bits (qubits), collaboratively forming a quantum circuit through their interactions. This circuit is processed, and its outcomes reshape the performer\u2019s environment. In this project, participants embody \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9, the orisha (deity) of crossroads and non-determinism, becoming creators of quantum algorithms. Like \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9, they navigate endless possibilities before making a choice. The project delves into the individual\u2019s role as an active agent in a sea of possibilities, influencing the world around them. In a society driven by hustle culture, it poses the question: what happens when the \u2018performance\u2019 of life no longer guarantees future rewards? Can insights from the orisha \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9 and If\u00e1 texts provide guidance for navigating uncertainties in emerging technologies? By extending performance beyond the stage into daily life, the project explores how quantum processing might shape the future, with our actions influencing technological progress.\n\nCurrents\nBy: G\u00e9raldine Honauer\n\nThe project \u201cCurrents\u201d focuses on an augmented reality (AR) experience that allows users to interact with live environmental data, such as air pollution and air flows, through body tracking and motion capture technologies. This AR environment aims to dynamically visualise in response to human movement, enhancing user engagement with critical environmental issues.\n\nCurrents is an immersive extended reality experience where environmental data becomes a sensory performance. Real-time CO\u2082 emissions and air flows are transformed into interactive virtual ecosystems through VR headsets. This living digital world reacts to your movement \u2014 bioluminescent plankton light up as you engage with the invisible forces around you.\n\nZWEI is supported by the \u201cFilm and Media Art\u201d committee of the Canton of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft (Switzerland).\n\nZwei (Two)\nBy: Beat Brogle &amp; iart\nAt the centre of the mixed reality work Zwei are two virtual \u201cbubbles\u201d - amorphous, algorithmically controlled beings that react in real time to their environment and the behaviour of visitors. Their behaviour is based on a structure of biological stimulus-response patterns, from which individual characteristics develop in the course of interaction. As part of a long-term media art project, Zwei explores the relationship between virtual beings and their environment \u2013 from simple algorithmic processes to the perspective of artificial intelligence.\n\nZwei is supported by the \u201cFilm and Media Art\u201d committee of the Canton of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft (Switzerland).",

    "description": "Taak explores surveillance, technology, and human dignity in Delhi\u2019s nightlife. When smartwatches are enforced on the nightclub staff, promising efficiency but raising safety concerns, Shalini and her colleagues face dehumanisation. They\u2019re reduced to data points.\n\nThe smartwatch becomes a symbol of control, and Shalini must fight to retain her and her colleagues\u2019 humanity. Rooted in observations of women in patriarchal systems, \u201cTaak\u201d questions the normalisation of surveillance and its ethical costs.\n\nTAAK, along with its companion film\u00a0Humans in the Loop, was incubated at the\u00a0Storiculture Impact Fellowship 2023, dedicated to bringing narratives of India\u2019s digital societies to a wider audience through film. Both films are presented by the\u00a0Museum of Imagined Futures (MOIF)\u00a0\u2014 a platform that\u00a0leverages creative media to explore and mainstream critical topics at the intersection of technology, society, and culture.",
