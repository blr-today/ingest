    "description": "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, a Sanskrit phrase meaning \u201cthe world is family\u201d, is a universalist idea that competes with dominant, exclusivist Hindu notions of caste. The director of the film, Anand Patwardhan, grew up in a milieu that questioned the latter. The family\u2019s elders had fought for India\u2019s Independence, but had rarely spoken about it. \u2018Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\u2019, words enshrined in India\u2019s Constitution, were subconsciously internalised.\n\nAs his parents aged, Anand began to film with whatever equipment was at hand. Soon, birthdays and family gatherings gave way to oral history. Revisiting home movie footage a decade after his parents had passed, was a revelation. Today, supremacist ideology has plagued and altered notions of democracy. As they rewrite India\u2019s history, memories of the past and the lessons they present us with have become more precious than mere personal nostalgia.\n\nJoin us for a screening of this award-winning documentary followed by a Q&amp;A with the filmmaker.\n\nCredits:\n\n- Production, Direction, Editing: Anand Patwardhan\n- Camera and Sound: Anand Patwardhan, Simantini Dhuru\n- Production Assistance: Simantini Dhuru, Mohosin Shaikh",
