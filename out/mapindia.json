    "description": "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, a Sanskrit phrase meaning \u201cthe world is family\u201d, is a universalist idea that competes with dominant, exclusivist Hindu notions of caste. The director of the film, Anand Patwardhan, grew up in a milieu that questioned the latter. The family\u2019s elders had fought for India\u2019s Independence, but had rarely spoken about it. \u2018Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\u2019, words enshrined in India\u2019s Constitution, were subconsciously internalised.\n\nAs his parents aged, Anand began to film with whatever equipment was at hand. Soon, birthdays and family gatherings gave way to oral history. Revisiting home movie footage a decade after his parents had passed, was a revelation. Today, supremacist ideology has plagued and altered notions of democracy. As they rewrite India\u2019s history, memories of the past and the lessons they present us with have become more precious than mere personal nostalgia.\n\nJoin us for a screening of this award-winning documentary followed by a Q&amp;A with the filmmaker.\n\nCredits:\n\n- Production, Direction, Editing: Anand Patwardhan\n- Camera and Sound: Anand Patwardhan, Simantini Dhuru\n- Production Assistance: Simantini Dhuru, Mohosin Shaikh",

    "description": "One of the most prolific sculptors of late 20th century India, Meera Mukherjee chose a mode of metal sculpting and a life-style that set her apart from most other artists of her time. The momentous turn in her career came with her first journey to Bastar in 1960, followed by a three-year country-wide study of traditional metal crafting communities and techniques. This in turn propelled the radical shift in her choice of sculpting methods and subjects, and more broadly in her notion of art as labour and collective practice.\n\nJoin Tapati Guha-Thakurta for a talk on her just-published edited volume, From the Depth of the Mould: Meera Mukherjee (1923-1998), A Centenary Tribute. It uses the metaphor of Meera Mukherjee\u2019s elaborate mould-making and metal casting process to look closely at the themes of material and technique, individual and community work, struggle and resilience in her life story.",
