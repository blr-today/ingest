    "description": "Discover a new perspective on the British Raj through the rare and stunning photographs of Raja Deen Dayal.\n\nJoin Dr. Sonya Rhie Mace and Dr. Barbara L. Tannenbaum, curators at the Cleveland Museum of Art, for a conversation about their collaborative exhibitions, including the 2023 exhibition Raja Deen Dayal: The King of Indian Photographers.\n\nDr. Mace and Dr. Tannenbaum have dedicated their careers to exploring the profound interplay between photography and historical Indian art. Their exhibition on Raja Deen Dayal, has shed light on how photographers and artists have presented Indian culture and religion from diverse perspectives.\n\nThrough a series of joint projects, such as, Temples and Worship in Southern Asia (currently on view) and Krishna and the Path of Grace, they have juxtaposed photography with historical Indian paintings, textiles, and artifacts.\u00a0\n\nThis conversation promises to offer valuable insights into the history of photography in India and its enduring impact on our understanding of art and culture.\n\nImage credits: Royal Elephant Ramkali with a Mahout, c. 1761.

    "description": "Join us for an essay filmmaking workshop with Falana Films, where they will introduce you to the essay film format and guide you in developing a short film (one to three minutes) while working with an archive.\n\nIn making your essay film, you will have access to a curated set of artworks from the MAP Collection, as well as a resource list of museum and other institutional archives available in the public domain. Additionally, you will be prompted to bring your own archival material\u2013found footage, home videos, family photographs, long-lost audio recordings, and any A/V material you feel is at the cusp of telling a story. You will also be encouraged to film additional footage throughout the workshop.\n\nThis four-day workshop extends across two weekends\u2013February 15\u201316 &amp; 22\u201323. Teams of four will be selected based on themes chosen by participants when they register for the workshop. These teams alongside the Falana team will work together to make the film.\n\nThe focus of this workshop is not as much on the technical aspects of filmmaking as it is on the meaning one can make from scattered archives when thematically exploring them.\u00a0\n\nExpanding on the thematic concerns of MAP\u2019s permanent exhibition, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection you can find the list of themes for the workshop below:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Body as Landscape: Gender Identity, Sexuality and Body-politics\n\n- Home and Away: Memory, Migration and Nostalgia\n\n- No Person\u2019s Land: Cities and Spaces\u00a0\n\n- \u2018Mad or What?\u2019: Mental Health and the City\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRegister soon as seats are limited.\n\nRead this document to find out more about the workshop, FAQs and a tentative schedule.",

    "description": "Popular cinema both shapes, and is shaped, by the world we live in; our social realities, our politics, and our perception of ourselves and others. However, what are the stories that we can find outside of the cinematic context itself? Explore the visual culture that surrounds cinematic production, and join us for this Film Ephemera Symposium that focuses on the nature, and possibilities of film ephemera as both object and subject.\u00a0\n\nFilm ephemera \u2013 including posters, lobby stills, lobby cards, and songbooks \u2013 were popularly designed in the 20th century as promotional materials. They were meant to communicate information and excite and thrill audiences, giving them a taste of what to expect. What happens when they have ceased to serve their function? What happens when they move from streets and theatres to museums and archives? What can we learn from them about the past and how can we engage with them in the contemporary moment?\u00a0\n\nThis symposium positions the archive as a living entity\u2014an interactive repository of knowledge that goes beyond preservation to inspire future dialogues. It brings together film historians, museum professionals, archivists, artists and scholars to explore the challenges and opportunities that lie in creating, accessing and working with film ephemera.\u00a0\n\nFrom the technologies and larger visual histories of the time, to the passion of fandom and embedded identity politics, each encounter with an object from the archive can create fresh meanings and offer new interpretations. By fostering dialogues around this, the symposium aims to bridge academic inquiry and public engagement, encouraging a reimagining of film ephemera as vibrant touch points between memory, materiality and collective identity.\n\nProgramme Schedule\n\n9:00 am to 10:00 am - Registration\n\n10:00 am to 10:15 am - Opening Remarks\n\n10:15 am to 11:00 am - Keynote Address by Ashish Rajadhyaksha\u00a0\n\n11:15 am to 12:45 pm - Panel 1: Reframing the Image: History, Politics and Art - Ranjini Mazumdar, Amarnath Praful and Rajan Krishnan.
