The makers\u2019 of these artefacts were not just limited to individual artists, but included families and even entire villages or communities, each with their own creative expression and heritage.\n\nKnown as putul in Bengali, these dolls not only serve as objects of play, worship and decoration, but also as bearers of stories. They carry their makers\u2019 beliefs, histories, cultural knowledge and reflections of their everyday lives.\n\nJoin us to discover the unique history of these objects and the rich stories they tell.\n\nPutul Katha is accompanied by the following events:\n- Clay Doll-Making with Sunderbans Doll Artists\n- Maati Katha (Earth Stories) \u2013 An Object &amp; Material Theatre Performance\n\nThis showcase is based on ongoing research by the Tram Arts Trust on the stories surrounding the doll arts of West Bengal.",
