Participants will engage in guided exercises that encourage spontaneity, rhythm, and composition through diverse tools and materials. The session will focus on the physicality of marks\u2014how gestures, textures, and repetition contribute to form and meaning\n\nThere are no right or wrong marks, only discoveries waiting to unfold.
