These objects provide a tangible connection to the time period, the lives of tawaifs, and the cultural memory of Hindi\u00a0 Cinema's timeless legacy.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to immerse yourself in the allure of classic Hindi cinema and discover the enduring legacy of the tawaif.\n\nMAP is grateful to Richa and Jamshed Chinoy for gifting this collection.\n\nThe exhibition has been made possible in partnership with Bank of America\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&nbsp;",

    "description": "How can a sense of agency, care and respect influence the experience of childbirth? This panel discussion explores the importance of respect and dignity in maternal healthcare, focusing on the experiences of women during pregnancy and childbirth in India.\u00a0\n\nThe artwork Mother and Child 2 by Nilima Sheikh offers a powerful visual representation of the maternal experience. It depicts a mother and her newborn, appearing as if they were drawn with a single, continuous line. The larger series that this painting is a part of, captures moments of the mother holding, nursing, and steadying her child \u2013 telling of the deep bond between them. However, the subtle hints of wounds and tears on the mother's body in this painting remind us of the physical and emotional challenges women face during childbirth.\n\nJoin us for a discussion that delves into the current state of maternal care, addressing the challenges that women face in healthcare settings and the stigma that surrounds their experiences in the maternal healthcare landscape. This discussion will cover public and private sectors but with a special focus on public sector hospitals.\n\nOur panellists, Dr Janhavi Nilekani, Mandira Kalra Kalaan, and Jamuna L, will be in conversation with Anoushaka Chandrashekar. They will also address the role of advocacy, awareness, and outreach in transforming maternity care practices.\n\nThis event is conceptualised under our exhibition VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection.",
