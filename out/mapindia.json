    "description": "In collaboration with Bangalore Film Forum (BFF), MAP is excited to announce the screening of Satyajit Ray\u2019s Seemabaddha, followed by a conversation between Ashish Rajadhyaksha and film studies professor, Madhuja Mukherjee.\n\nThe film is centred around Shyamlal, who is from a small village but is entirely immersed in the comforts of his well paid corporate job. His young sister-in-law Tutul, on her first visit to Calcutta, is dismayed by his boastful displays of accumulated perks and privileges. However his fa\u00e7ade cracks when a lucrative export order faces cancellation. Faced with the possibility of losing everything he has built, Shyamlal concocts a plot of feigned industrial sabotage to save face.\n\nSatyajit Ray\u2019s Seemabaddha (Company Limited in English) is an epochal portrait of the rise of the educated urban middle-class. Shyamlal\u2019s ironic ascendancy up the corporate ladder, a rise in statute simultaneously accompanied by a fall in character, is the director\u2019s starkest reflection on modern India.\u00a0\n\nThis screening is the fifth installment of 'The Radical Seventies,' a six-month series curated by Ashish Rajadhyaksha.A collaboration between MAP and Bangalore Film Forum, the series is specially crafted for youth to engage with older classics that resonate with our contemporary times, in familiar and unexpected ways. The Radical Seventies is part of our youth engagement programming for AUD/VID.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn collaboration with:\n\nNFDC-National Film Archive of India (NFAI)\n\nImage Credits :\u00a0 NFDC - National Film Archive of India",
