Another way to read an artwork is to look for what's not in the 'frame'\u2014to explore the circumstances of its creation and the use of the artwork, rather than just the artwork itself.\n\nIn this guided walk, you will get to explore our permanent exhibition, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women through the MAP Collection, through the lens of an archivist. We will discuss the maker, the purpose, a specific object's relation to others, and the broader social and historical environment in which the artworks were created. In archival sciences, this is called contextualisation, where archivists understand records through the varied ways in which memories (remembered or in recorded acts) have been transmitted over time and space with numerous inscriptions, transmissions, and omissions.\n\nAlthough it sounds technical, the process itself can be disruptive and playful. It involves gossip, peeking behind the curtain, and an understanding of the complex process of making art!",

    "description": "This lecture examines the literary and artistic oeuvre of Ram Kumar, one of India\u2019s foremost modernist voices, through an interdisciplinary lens that foregrounds his fiction and correspondence. Focusing primarily on his novels and letters, the presentation traces themes of existential solitude, urban alienation, and moral ambiguity that permeate his prose, revealing a deeply introspective engagement with post-independence India. His letters\u2014especially those displaced at MAP\u2014offer rare insights into his philosophical temperament and creative process. These textual reflections are then juxtaposed with his abstract paintings, not as separate expressions but as silent extensions of the same emotional and intellectual terrain. \n\nBy connecting word and image, the lecture proposes a unified reading of Ram Kumar\u2019s work as a sustained meditation on silence, memory, and the search for meaning.\n\nThis programme is conjunction with Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar",
