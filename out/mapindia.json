    "description": "Explore MAP's latest exhibition, The Forgotten Souvenir, through a guided walk and discover how\u00a0 the art of mica paintings were created during the East India Company\u2019s heyday. These paintings, both art and historical documents, showcase professions, societal roles, and colonial India's rigid caste and class systems and thus, offer unique insights into everyday life under colonial rule.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese delicate works, painted on thin sheets of muscovite mica from Murshidabad, Patna, and Trichinopoly, reflect the adaptation of Indian artists as royal patronage declined. They served as easily portable, attractive souvenirs for British travellers, bridging the gap between traditional miniature painting and the rise of photography.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAccompanied by Amit Dutta\u2019s short film Moments before Mutiny and an interactive game, this guided walk invites you to journey deeper into this nearly forgotten chapter of Indian art.\n\nPhoto Credits:\u00a0Philippe\u00a0Calia",

This course is designed for people working in libraries, archives and other institutional collections, who work with photographic materials as a part of their professional responsibilities.\n\nOver 12 weeks of on-site instruction, you will learn the fundamentals of photograph conservation: identification of photographic processes, minor conservation treatments, preventive conservation, and disaster salvage for 19th, 20th, and 21st century materials. At the end of the course, you will return to your home institution, and carry out a 4-week conservation project, where you will apply what you have learnt during the course.\n\nThe workshop will be hands-on, where you will spend time in the darkroom reconstructing historical processes to understand the materials, their identification, and deterioration. This will be complemented by sessions in the conservation lab, where you will work on historical and contemporary photographs. In addition to in-person training, you will attend online lectures from art-historians and conservators to understand what we do and why we do it.\n\nApply for this programme and we will let you know if you are selected by February 10th, 2025.\n\nThis training programme is supported by Tata Trusts and conducted by the Museum of Art &amp; Photography, Bengaluru.",
