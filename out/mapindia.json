    "description": "In collaboration with Bangalore Film Forum (BFF), MAP is excited to announce the screening of Yeh Woh Manzil To Nahin, followed by a conversation facilitated by Ashish Rajadhyakhsha with Sudhir Mishra.\n\nThe plot follows three old men, who used to be close friends during their school days, embark on a train journey from Bombay to Rajpur to attend the centenary celebration of their boarding school. As they travel, memories of their student activism and past failures flood their minds. Upon reaching their destination, they are confronted by political skirmishes that serve as a stark reminder of the occasions when they had failed to stay true to their conscience.\n\nThis screening is the sixth installment of \u2018The Radical Seventies,\u2019 a six-month series curated by Ashish Rajadhyaksha. A collaboration between MAP and Bangalore Film Forum, the series is specially crafted for youth to engage with older classics that resonate with our contemporary times, in familiar and unexpected ways. The Radical Seventies is part of our youth engagement programming for AUD/VID.",

It will also explore the theme of Silicon Plateau\u2019s forthcoming Volume 3: exploring the intersections of technology, magic and ritual, and how folklore and cultural traditions can challenge dominant digital narratives, inspiring alternative pathways for human\u2013algorithm collaboration.\n\nThrough distinct approaches, Cassiani and Petrozzi engage with digital cultures, alternative perspectives and the role of technology in shaping contemporary society. Petrozzi focuses on themes of care, the future and algorithmic governance.\u00a0\n\nEmbracing the role of a \u201cdigital witch,\u201d she reimagines mysticism and the occult within the context of technology and politics. Cassiani, working across performance, choreography, digital media and club culture, explores the margins of both online and offline worlds. She examines how digital platforms shape collective experience and reflects on the loss of local identity in an increasingly globalised age.\u00a0\n\nJoin us as each artist draws upon ritual, myth and digital aesthetics to question our relationship with technology and envision new possibilities for our shared realities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis event and the artist-in-residence programme are supported by The Consulate General of Italy in Bengaluru.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;",

    "description": "Popular cinema both shapes, and is shaped, by the world we live in; our social realities, our politics, and our perception of ourselves and others. However, what are the stories that we can find outside of the cinematic context itself? Explore the visual culture that surrounds cinematic production, and join us for this Film Ephemera Symposium that focuses on the nature, and possibilities of film ephemera as both object and subject.\u00a0\n\nFilm ephemera \u2013 including posters, lobby stills, lobby cards, and songbooks \u2013 were popularly designed in the 20th century as promotional materials. They were meant to communicate information and excite and thrill audiences, giving them a taste of what to expect. What happens when they have ceased to serve their function? What happens when they move from streets and theatres to museums and archives? What can we learn from them about the past and how can we engage with them in the contemporary moment?\u00a0\n\nThis symposium positions the archive as a living entity\u2014an interactive repository of knowledge that goes beyond preservation to inspire future dialogues. It brings together film historians, museum professionals, archivists, artists and scholars to explore the challenges and opportunities that lie in creating, accessing and working with film ephemera.\u00a0\n\nFrom the technologies and larger visual histories of the time, to the passion of fandom and embedded identity politics, each encounter with an object from the archive can create fresh meanings and offer new interpretations. By fostering dialogues around this, the symposium aims to bridge academic inquiry and public engagement, encouraging a reimagining of film ephemera as vibrant touch points between memory, materiality and collective identity.\n\nProgramme Schedule\n\n9:00 am to 10:00 am - Registration\n\n10:00 am to 10:15 am - Opening Remarks\n\n10:15 am to 11:00 am - Keynote Address by Ashish Rajadhyaksha\u00a0\n\n11:15 am to 12:45 pm - Panel 1: Reframing the Image: History, Politics and Art - Amarnath Praful, Rajan Kurai Krishnan and Ranjani Mazumdar.
