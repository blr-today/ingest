The Writing Table gives audiences a chance to write a letter to themselves, loved ones, strangers, or even a city through a set of prompts. Family Label facilitates an exploration of abstract art by allowing visitors to look at artworks and creating a label on what they think the artwork means, or what they see or feel when faced with an abstract artwork.\n\nShape of a Thought also features the film \u2018The Spaces in Between\u2019 by Naveed Mulki. The film explores letter exchanges between Ram Kumar and his friend and the many conversations they have on life, art and the world.",

    "description": "From dancing elephants and beloved deities, to steamships and radiators, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery. These labels arrived in Indian markets in the thousands, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India), and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire, memory, and meaning into the act of purchase.\n\nThe exhibition, Ticket Tika Chaap, explores these textile labels known as tikats (tickets), tikas or chaaps, and their art-historical and commercial significance, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement, in India.\n\nPlease note: This guided walk, will be conducted in Kannada by Rajesh from the MAP Team.\n\n&nbsp;",
