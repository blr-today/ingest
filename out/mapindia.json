    "description": "Join us for a delightful talk that unravels the enchanting world of \u2018Colchas,\u2019 exquisite embroidered textiles from the MAP collection! Colchas are decorative textiles, often characterized by elaborate embroidery or stitching, that originated in Portugal and were later embraced and transformed in Latin America. The term \"colcha\" translates to \"bedspread\" or \"coverlet,\" and these textiles were traditionally used as bed coverings or wall hangings.\u00a0\n\nGuided by textile collector Jeevak Parpia, this session promises to take you on a journey through the intricate visual storytelling that defines these extraordinary artifacts. Discover the unique motifs woven into each \u2018colcha\u2019, and their deep cultural and historical resonance.\u00a0\n\nWith his wealth of expertise, Mr. Parpia will talk on the artistic traditions and cross-cultural exchanges that shaped these textiles, tracing their roots from Portugal to Latin America, how colchas became a canvas for storytelling, reflecting the lives, beliefs, and aspirations of their makers.",
