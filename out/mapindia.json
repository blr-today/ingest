    "description": "A warm invitation to all neurodivergent and queer Folks!\nJoin us for the 4th edition of NeuroQueer Brain Box facilitated by Mani Agarwal, a NeuroQueer therapist. This session will celebrate the diversity and stories of our bodies. Together, we will explore how our bodies are integral to our identities.\nWe\u2019ll begin with a guided walk of the exhibition, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE:Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection, through a queer lens. As you move through the space, reflect on some words that come up for you; let them resonate with you, and bring them into our group space. Together, through shared reflections and queer perspectives on our bodies, we\u2019ll map our feelings with art. This will be a space to celebrate neuroqueer creativity and build a sense of community, where we spend time with our own bodies to feel seen and affirmed.\u00a0\nPlease note: This is a free session exclusively for individuals who identify as LGBTQIA+ or are individuals with ADHD/Autism/AuDHD.",
