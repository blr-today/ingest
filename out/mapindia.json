    "description": "India is a land of Subaltern deities, where each deity has a unique legend and these legends are often interwoven with socio-historic tropes of India.\n\nThe Puthirai vannaar\u00a0 are a Dalit caste group known as the 'unseeable', in southern India. Their forced-occupation is to wash the clothes of other Dalits, the dead, and menstruating women. This film explores the tale of a young girl who grew up in the Puthirai vannaar caste group and how she came to be immortalised as their local deity, Maadathy.\n\nDo note: This is a Tamil language film and is subtitled in English.",

    "description": "Enter a world steeped in tradition, shaped by a craft that dates back thousands of years!\n\nPutul Katha is a special showcase that invites audiences to explore the practice of doll-making in West Bengal and the cultural heritage of this unique art form. While the display mainly highlights one-of-a-kind hand-pressed clay dolls and some other variations, the region has had a rich history of dolls being made from almost every natural material \u2014from seeds, leaves and wood, to metal, glass, fabric, and more. The makers\u2019 of these artefacts were not just limited to individual artists, but included families and even entire villages or communities, each with their own creative expression and heritage.\n\nKnown as putul in Bengali, these dolls not only serve as objects of play, worship and decoration, but also as bearers of stories. They carry their makers\u2019 beliefs, histories, cultural knowledge and reflections of their everyday lives.\n\nJoin us to discover the unique history of these objects and the rich stories they tell.\n\nPutul Katha is accompanied by the following events:\n- Clay Doll-Making with Sunderbans Doll Artists\n- Maati Katha (Earth Stories) \u2013 An Object &amp; Material Theatre Performance\n\nThis showcase is based on ongoing research by the Tram Arts Trust on the stories surrounding the doll arts of West Bengal.",

Together, as participants and facilitators, we will experiment with ways of broadening our relationship with history, critically examining the present, and imagining the futures we hope for and work towards.\n\nThrough a series of hands-on exercises and discussions, we will explore three key themes:\n\nPreservation\n- What do we choose to preserve, and how? We will engage with a range of materials to think about preservation both practically and politically.\n\nOrganisation\n- How does the structure of memory storage shape how it is understood? We\u2019ll reflect on different archival logics and the possibilities of queering archival organisation\n\nAccess\n- How do we dream through the archive? We\u2019ll imagine the audiences of the future and consider how we want our saved materials to speak to them.\n\nThis workshop is an invitation to think, feel, and make within the space of collective memory and queer futurity.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "description": "From dancing elephants and beloved deities, to steamships and radiators, textile labels showcased a variety of captivating imagery. These labels arrived in Indian markets in the thousands, stuck on yards upon yards of cotton fabric manufactured in the mills of Britain (and India), and sold in Indian and global markets. They wove desire, memory, and meaning into the act of purchase.\n\nThe exhibition, Ticket Tika Chaap, explores these textile labels known as tikats (tickets), tikas or chaaps, and their art-historical and commercial significance, as perhaps the earliest forms of branding and advertisement, in India.\n\nPlease note: This guided walk, will be conducted in Kannada by Rajesh from the MAP Team.\n\n&nbsp;",

Tracing a journey that began with a residency in Sweden in 2019 and continues in his hometown of Erode, Tamil Nadu, Mariappan uses photography to map, connect, and make sense of place.\n\nIn this talk, he reflects on how his recent work extends and weaves together two earlier projects into an ongoing exploration of space, distance, and belonging.",

This experience nudges the boundaries of observation and emotional response, inviting us to transform true stories into spontaneous performances. Come, play with us, and discover the many ways we see ourselves reflected in art and in each other.\n\nThis workshop is presented in conjunction with MAP\u2019s ongoing exhibition, VISIBLE/INVISIBLE: Representation of Women in Art through the MAP Collection.",

The panelists share a unique connection with QAMRA (Queer Archive for Memory, Reflection, and Activism), an autonomous community archive at the National Law School of India University in Bengaluru.
