    "description": "How do we truly engage with art? Is it simply appreciating its aesthetic beauty, or is there more to it?\n\nThis month's Tuesday Tidbits features Shubhasree Purkayastha\u00a0from our Education and Outreach team and focuses on looking beyond the surface to foster learning experiences and make meaningful connections with art. She will focus on our latest exhibition, Chay Reds, Ferrous Black, which includes a story trail especially designed for families to use as a fun journey through the show. Discussing the behind-the-scenes process of developing this, she will highlight how the education team uses exhibitions as the foundation to drive greater creative engagement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTuesday Tidbits is a series that seeks to support youth in career research/building and acts as a space for networking for young people.",

    "description": "This workshop facilitated by Bhumika Saraswati, invites participants to creatively document the subtle but urgent impacts of extreme heat, especially its invisible effects indoors and outdoors. Through visuals and text, we will explore how heat intersects with gender, caste, and identity in our everyday life. We will also reflect on the gendered nature of certain crises and how they exacerbate existing inequalities.\n\nIn Phase 1, we\u2019ll explore the challenge of visually capturing heat, a crisis that lacks visible markers yet shapes lives deeply. Using examples from her work, Bhumika will discuss how to approach sensitive storytelling, whether capturing one\u2019s own experiences or those of others.\u00a0\n\nIn Phase 2, we\u2019ll move to hands-on creative engagement. Participants will be prompted to represent their personal experiences of heat\u2014whether through photography, drawing, video, or writing. This phase emphasises honest expression and encourages careful, thoughtful observation.\n\nFinally, in Phase 3, we\u2019ll share and reflect on the pieces created. This is an open space for participants to present their work and discuss the diverse ways we perceive and document heat. The workshop will conclude with a discussion on making invisible climate impacts visible, particularly within the contexts of gender and social identity.\n\nLimited spots available.
