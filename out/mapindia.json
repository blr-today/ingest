That's how Laetitia felt on 6 May 2012, the day of the second round of the French presidential election. Join us for a film screening of Age of Panic/La Bataille de Solf\u00e9rino, a french comedy film directed by Justine Triet. The film is about a frazzled young mother who navigates the homefront during a pivotal moment in French politics. This screening will be followed by a discussion.\n\nThis film is in collaboration with the Alliance Francaise Bangalore and part of our series Femme: Beneath the surface, which aims to spotlight an emerging generation of French storytellers, each dissecting characters that embody the idea of the woman - layered, disoriented and probing. Set against the backdrop of contemporary France - where questions of class, identity, and belonging remain urgent and unresolved - these films trace the quiet resistance and raw introspection of women thrown into complex situations. This series aims to engage with younger audiences who see through facades, question structure, and crave stories that don\u2019t look away from the fractures beneath the surface.\n\nThis film will be screened in French with English subtitles.",

Join us for a performance by Dominique Savitri Bonarjee as she presents \"How to Dream a Rasa Machine,\" a sensuous journey into sound, movement, and the subtle energies of our world. Structured as an electrifying jam session, blending electronic and acoustic textures with embodied dance, this performance is deeply inspired by the intricacies of Indian rasa. At its heart lies a handcrafted copper sound suit, a revolutionary instrument that translates the performer\u2019s every motion and environmental nuances \u2013 gravity, air, humidity \u2013 into a rich sonic landscape.\n\nIn Indian aesthetics, rasa refers to the spiritual pleasure of deep immersion in experience. Here, the audience encounters rasa through the sensuous materiality of the instrument, and a spectral soundscape that induces a collective dream-space.\u00a0\n\nThis is followed by \u2018Butoh, as Heard by a Dancer\u2019, book presentation.",

Here, employing a feminist lens means that their practices expose power hierarchies framed by factors including but not limited to gender\u2013 like caste, race, sex, sexuality and more.\n\nThe first iteration of the conference looked at practice and the second at the infrastructure that enabled those practices. Each panel in both the conferences could stand alone, but was bound by a common way of seeing and understanding\u2013how can feminist practices help carve out a less precarious, sustainable and just sector for us? How has it done it before in pockets and niches? How does it continue to do it and how could we scale or replicate it in meaningful ways?\n\nFor the concluding conference, we want to take stock of where we are. Reflecting on the three years of work and conversations we have had under the conference and the permanent exhibition, this year\u2019s iteration will be a sweep\u2013its aim, not to mark success but to be honest about the lay of the land. Since speaking of various concerns\u2013of representation, of precarity, of a crisis of care, of lack of funding, of impunity, of inaccessibility, and exclusion\u2013on a micro level, at this conference, and on a macro level, at many more forums\u2013what have been the shifts and silences that have gotten us here \u2013for better or for worse?\n\nAs we mark the last year of the exhibition, we want to gather artists, art workers, writers, academics and institutions to reflect on the evolution of their work in the sector, speak to each other regarding doubt, success and failure and look back at the blueprints of our work.\n\nFor any queries, please reach out to visible@map-india.org\n\nPlease note: This conference is free to attend.
