    "description": "In an age of instant messages and disappearing stories, the play \"Love Letters: Ninna Preetiya Naanu\" invites you to pause, reflect, and turn the pages of the past\u2014one heartfelt letter at a time.\n\nThis poignant, original Kannada play explores the depth of a lifelong connection between two people bound by nostalgia, affection, and all the words left unsaid. Imagine scrolling through a lifetime of messages\u2014not through DMs, but through yellowing pages, hurried handwriting, and tear-stained notes. From scribbled notes in school notebooks to confessions that arrive too late, the play spans decades of friendship and almost-love.\n\nIt's a journey through innocence, longing, and the quiet ache of missed chances\u2014narrated through letters that become both a timeline and a testament to what was, and what might have been.\n\nThis performance is in conjunction with the exhibition Shape of a Thought: Letters from Ram Kumar.",
