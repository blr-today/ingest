SUMMARY:The Andaman Elephant Enigma
DESCRIPTION:Documentary | 2024 | 52 minutes | English | India \nAuthors: Prajna Chowta & Philippe Gautier\nDirection & Photography : Philippe Gautier\nExecutive Producer: Charlotte Uzu\nLine Producer: Yoann Dhenin\nCamera Operator: Michel Esquirol\nEditing: Giuliano Papacchioli\nSound Designer: Jean Mallet\nColour Correction: Jean Coudsi\nMusic: Jean Mallet\, Trio-Xenakis\nCo-production: Bayerischer Rundfunk\, Les Films d’ici\, ElephanTTrackinG \nLink to the trailer. \nIn the 19th century\, European navigators exploring the Andaman Islands—an archipelago of nearly 200 islands in the Indian Ocean\, situated between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea—were surprised to find no large mammals common to South Asia\, particularly elephants. This was puzzling since elephants were present on other Indian Ocean islands like Sumatra\, Borneo\, and Sri Lanka\, which share a similar geological history and were accessible from the continent during the Pleistocene glaciations. Adding to the mystery\, the Andamans are home to primitive tribes who likely reached the islands by land during the last Ice Age. So\, why were elephants absent? \nIronically\, starting in 1858\, the British colonial administration imported elephants by ship from Burma and India to the Andamans for use in the timber extraction industry\, where these animals were essential. During the 20th century\, some of these elephants escaped or were abandoned\, finding refuge on deserted islands where they returned to the wild. This phenomenon is unique in the history of the species\, which is otherwise suffering from habitat loss across Asia. \nHow did these elephants reach the islands? Did they swim across the sea as commonly believed? This film investigates the enigmatic history of the Andaman elephants. \nA screening of the documentary will be followed by a conversation with the Directors\, Philippe Gautier & Prajna Chowta and a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Ravana: Demon or Not?
DESCRIPTION:Demonised as he was after his death\, the reign of King Ravana of Lanka\, and his ancestors\, the powerful Mayuranga\, has long been obscured and shrouded in myth. Their kingdom is believed to have reached beyond the shores of the island\, once\, capturing lands across the seas. A kingdom of such magnitude was never seen again on Lanka. \nIn a bid to shed light on this lost era\, Sunela Jayewardene travelled through Sri Lanka\, and listened to the storytellers and poets\, researched Sri Lanka’s folklore\, sifted through race and religion\, to stitch together a history of a forgotten landscape. \nThe story of the kingdom that Ravana had ruled lay over the island like a fading\, antique map. The edges of the story were frayed and there were lines disconnected by time\, but the landscape it traced\, exists. Ravana’s Lanka: The Landscape of a Lost Kingdom\, written by Sunela Jayewardene is the story she learnt of King Ravana and the kingdom that he lost. \nIn this session\, Sunela will be in conversation with Theatre Practitioner\, Anuradha Venkataraman. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Hundred Count Yarn
DESCRIPTION:Where does our fabric come from? What transforms a ball of cotton into the comfortable clothes we wear? In our fast-paced\, consumerist society\, many of us are unaware of the origins of our clothing. While we buy a lot of clothes\, the weavers behind them often earn meager sums for their labor and effort. Consumers frequently spend large amounts on what they believe to be handloom and handspun fabrics\, but they often lack the means to verify the authenticity of their purchases. Much of the handloom fabric available in the market is made from mill-spun yarn containing polyester and viscose. \nFor urban spinners\, spinning yarn is therapeutic. It disconnects us from our devices and connects us to something tangible. Spinning is meditative and accessible to people of all ages (8 years and up). It promotes slow\, sustainable living and supports an equitable ecosystem for handloom weavers\, tailors\, and fabric dyers. \nThe aim of this session is to raise awareness about yarn spinning and demonstrate the transformation of cotton into yarn for fabric making. The session will include a 12-minute video on the context of the craft\, demonstrations of spinning using the Peti Charkha\, demonstrations of spinning using the Gandhi Charkha and much more! \n

SUMMARY:Nakshatra
DESCRIPTION:Violinists Trina Basu and Arun Ramamurthy present their debut album\, Nakshatra. This lush and spiritual collaboration bridges traditions and defies genres\, blending South Indian classical music\, Western chamber music\, and jazz improvisation. The album’s title\, a Sanskrit word for constellations and interconnectedness\, encapsulates its expansive sound\, created by two violins in sublime harmony. \nNakshatra is a cinematic work that conveys a sense of two souls conversing across centuries. Rooted in diverse musical traditions\, Trina and Arun reimagine the potential of string chamber music with a unique sound described by The New Yorker as “free-flowing and globe-spanning\,” and by The Guardian as resonating “with the power of an ancient drone\, revivified by a fearless\, contemporary spirit.” This album\, five years in the making\, is a testament to the duo’s fluency in improvisation\, offering a deeply intimate yet grand musical experience. Join us for an evening that promises to be both introspective and expansive\, celebrating the intricate interplay of two violinists. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Confronting Capitalism
DESCRIPTION:What went wrong with capitalism? Ruchir Sharma’s account is not like any you will have heard before. He says progressives are right\, in part\, when they mock modern capitalism as “socialism for the rich.” For a century\, governments have expanded in just about every measurable dimension\, from spending to regulation and the scale of financial rescues when the economy wobbles. The result is expensive state guarantees for everyone—bailouts for the rich\, entitlements for the middle class\, welfare for the poor. \nTaking you back to the 19th century\, Sharma shows how completely the reflexes of government have changed: from hands-off to hands-on\, from doing too little to help anyone in hard times to today trying to prevent anyone suffering any economic pain\, ever. Trading sins of omission and indifference for excesses of spending and meddling\, governments from the United States to Europe and Japan have pumped so much money into their economies that financial markets can no longer invest all that capital efficiently. \nInadvertently\, they have fueled the rise of monopolies\, “zombie” firms\, and billionaires. They have made capitalism less fair and less efficient\, which is slowing economic growth and fueling popular anger. The first step to a cure is a correct diagnose of the problem. Capitalism has been badly distorted by constant government intervention and the relentless spread of a bailout culture. Building an even bigger state will only double down on what ruined capitalism in the first place. \nThe author\, Ruchir Sharma\, will be in conversation with Chairman and Co-founder\, Infosys and Founding Chairman UIDAI (Aadhaar)\, Nandan Nilekani. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n
