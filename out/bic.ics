SUMMARY:Is Demography Destiny?
DESCRIPTION:In the context of contemporary US elections\, many have claimed that “demography is destiny.” This kind of rhetoric became particularly popular among Democratic strategists after Barack Obama was elected as president in 2008. According to this theory\, Democrats will have a significant advantage in upcoming national\, particularly presidential\, elections\, given the party’s widespread appeal among a multiracial and otherwise diverse coalition of voters. The Republican Party\, in this view\, has made a strategic miscalculation by relying too heavily on white (particularly white male) voters\, especially since the Nixon years. In recent years\, however\, there is a growing sense among many observers that demography may not\, after all\, be destiny; that voting behavior may not neatly align along a white-nonwhite divide\, with non-Hispanic white men voting for the Republican Party and the rest of the country voting Democrat. \nIn this lecture\, Prof. Cyril Ghosh will offer an overview of this debate\, with some remarks about what we might expect to see in the 2024 US presidential elections. In so doing\, he will discuss the demographic make-up of the voting blocs of each of the two major parties in the US\, how they came to be\, and how they are likely to vote in November 2024. \n

SUMMARY:Matters of Plasma
DESCRIPTION:Dive into the electrifying world of plasma\, the fourth state of matter beyond solids\, liquids\, and gases. Plasma\, made up of ions\, electrons\, and neutrals\, is a quasi-neutral substance where particle motion is influenced by electric and magnetic fields. This state of matter is an excellent conductor of electricity and exhibits unique collective behaviors. \nA combined effort of seven countries (EU as one country) in building the ITER tokamak in France is under progress\, where India is a full partner. Low temperature (~ eV) plasmas with similar ion\, electron and neutral temperatures can be used as an intense heat source. Such a heat source can dissociate large molecules\, and hence such a plasma source is used for waste treatment. Low temperature (electrons ~ few eV\, ions and neutrals ~ 0.1 eV) plasmas\, where electron temperature is more than ion and neutral temperatures\, are chemically very active and can be used for surface modification. \n In this talk\, Prof. Subroto Mukherjee will cover various aspects of plasmas and its applications\, from energy to environmental solutions. \nThis lecture is a part of RRI’s Vignyana Kathegalu\, a series of popular talks on science. \nPresented by: Raman Research Institute\, Bangalore \n \n

SUMMARY:The City and the Scam
DESCRIPTION:In this event\, Professor Malini Ranganathan will discuss her new book\, Corruption Plots: Stories\, Ethics\, and Publics of the Late Capitalist City (Yoda Press 2024\, Cornell University Press 2023). Through ethnographic fieldwork\, the book studies what its co-authors call “corruption plots” from the streets of Bengaluru and Mumbai\, where black money\, skyscrapers\, land grabs\, encroachment on wetlands\, and slum evictions invoke outrage at deepening economic polarization and the impunity with which the real estate lobby operates. Flying in the face of conventional wisdom\, the book argues that corruption is a story-telling practice charged with ethical meaning\, one that does not simply condemn illegality or bribery\, but is also used to call attention to the legal—and legalized—abuses of power by the state\, political class\, and elites. \nAt the same time\, the book warns that anger by various publics about corruption is uneven\, inflected by caste\, class\, and ethno-religious bias\, especially in the context of rightwing nationalism and crony capitalism in India. Why do certain things get called “corruption” while others don’t—and why do corruption charges suddenly erupt into public discourse\, while at other times remain muted in the background?  \nDrawing on ethnography in two Indian cities undertaken in 2018\, as well as a cross-section of films and novels on the global city (in India and beyond)\, this book attends to the political slipperiness\, sensationalism\, and opportunism associated with corruption talk\, wherein fantastical scams about the city can often appear more fictional than factual. Ultimately\, in deriving a humanistic and multifaceted theory of corruption—sorely lacking in one-dimensional policy pronouncements—the book contends that across the world’s ostensible democracies\, we need a more grounded analysis of how anti-corruption has been selectively championed and challenged\, and with what effects\, by both liberal and rightwing regimes. More information available here. The author will briefly discuss the book\, followed by a conversation with Professor Sushmita Pati and an audience Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:Just Hiss
DESCRIPTION:50 minutes | English and Kannada  \nJust Hiss is a compelling adaptation of the short folk story titled A Serpent’s Predicament. Just Hiss is an ode to coexistence\, following the transformative journey of a snake to choose love over hate. As the play navigates the complex dynamics between the snake\, the forest denizens\, and the villagers of Rasbharpur\, it skillfully tackles the universal themes of unity and understanding. The resonant narrative serves as a reminder of the profound impact that choices\, particularly those rooted in love and compassion\, can have on fostering harmony in a world shared by diverse beings. \nDirector’s note: \nJust Hiss is not just a play; it is a whimsical journey crafted especially for children\, featuring endearing animal characters. At its heart\, it unfolds an analogical tale\, resonant with the pressing message of our times—understanding the limitations of one’s perspective and the imperative need to embrace and accommodate others. \nConceived with meticulous care and having undergone several work-in-progress phases\, this play is a testament to the idea that assumptions should yield to genuine inquiry. It serves as a reminder to care enough to ask\, fostering the spirit of coming together and progressing impactfully. \n

SUMMARY:The Fourth Wave
DESCRIPTION:Despite the clear danger of the rise of totalitarianism in India today\, Radha Kumar’s book\, The Republic Relearnt: Renewing Indian Democracy (1947-2024) aims is to look forward to the moment when democracy will be renewed in the country and ask what lessons can be learnt from past experience to anchor it more firmly when the opportunity arises. \nIt is generally assumed that Indian democracy has had an unbroken run since Independence\, with the brief disruption of the 1975–77 Emergency. While those two years saw a stark assault on democratic institutions\, Indian democracy had been repeatedly punctured prior to the Emergency\, and it has been threatened many times since. The country underwent almost four decades of democracy decay after the founding years of the republic\, as compared to the three relatively short-lived waves of democracy renewal. That fact makes an examination of these three waves rather significant. \nExamining the three waves of democracy renewal\, Kumar finds that the most valuable lessons lie in policy actions as well as proposals that were left unimplemented. These\, which ranged from electoral reform to human development\, social justice and institutional as well as federal autonomy\, could form the bedrock for a third republic\, albeit partly. India’s democratic future\, Kumar concludes\, depends on the extent to which a revived political opposition and civil and political society can draw on the lessons of the three waves of democracy renewal. \nIn this session\, she is in conversation with Lakshmi Arya Thathachar\, Professor\, RV University. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n  \n

SUMMARY:Moon on the Man
DESCRIPTION:2021 | 75 mins | English and Hindi | India \nMoon on the Man is an observational and exploratory feature length documentary that questions the most basic assumptions of reality\, perception and choices. As such\, it is synonymous with every individual’s struggle to find direction\, some that bear fruit in the ever-evolving landscape of human perspectives and others that segue into mental illness\, old age and broken dreams. \nThe film looks at two eccentric personalities Praklawn and Sailesh\, through their stories\, life experiences and their everyday activities. This narrative is annexed by Aasif and Wadood at a juncture when the stories of Praklawn and Sailesh enter into the realms of magic realism. They scrutinize Praklawn’s and Sailesh’s eventful past and their debate on the men’s life throws open a Pandora’s box which questions the very nature of our reality. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with Director\, Prince Shah and Filmmaker\, Sunanda Bhat. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nCredits:\nDirector: Prince Shah\nCinematographer: Vaibhav Sorte\nEditors: Ashish Ranglani\, Prince Shah\nMusic Composer: Prassanna Vishwanathan\nSound: Tarun Bhandari\nGrade: Kabir Nagranee\nProducers: Anshul Pandey\, Prince Shah \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Leela
DESCRIPTION:Leela is an immersive dance production that delves into the timeless spiritual love story of Krishna\, Radha\, and the Gopis in the sacred town of Vrindavan. Inspired by the rich cultural and spiritual heritage of India\, the production aims to bring to life the essence of devotion\, longing\, and the transcendental nature of love through a fusion of classical Indian dance forms\, music\, and intricate storytelling. \nSet against the backdrop of the illuminated night of Vrindavan\, the production chronicles the emotional journey of Radha and the Gopis as they grapple with the profound yearning for Krishna’s divine presence.

Because to truly live\, you must first watch the films that make life worth living. \nThis month’s film featured in our informal film club is Duvidha (1973) \nDuvidha is a hauntingly beautiful and thought-provoking film that delves into the realms of folklore\, desire\, and the complexities of human relationships. Based on a Rajasthani folktale\, the film weaves a captivating tale of a young bride\, Lachhi\, whose newfound marriage is immediately put to the test by circumstances beyond her control. \nOn the very day of their wedding\, Lachhi’s husband\, a merchant’s son\, departs on a five-year business trip\, leaving her behind in the care of his family. Amidst this lonely existence\, a mischievous and longing ghost\, enchanted by Lachhi’s beauty\, devises a cunning plan to impersonate her husband and gain her affection. \nDirector Mani Kaul’s masterful storytelling and Navroze Contractor’s exceptional cinematography breathe life into this enigmatic narrative\, creating a hypnotic and surreal atmosphere that blurs the boundaries between the corporeal and the ethereal. The film’s striking visuals\, infused with rich textures and rhythmic sequences\, transport the viewer into the vibrant tapestry of Rajasthani culture\, where the rhythms of daily life intertwine with the spectral realm. \nAt its core\, Duvidha is a metaphysical exploration of love\, desire\, and the complexities of human relationships. The ghost’s obsession with Lachhi and his subsequent impersonation of her husband raise profound questions about identity\, fidelity\, and the nature of love itself. The film invites the viewer to ponder the depths of human longing and the lengths to which one might go to satisfy that longing. \nBeyond its captivating narrative\, Duvidha also serves as a powerful commentary on societal norms and gender dynamics. Lachhi’s predicament\, torn between her duty as a wife and the allure of the supernatural\, reflects the constraints and expectations placed upon women in traditional societies. The film subtly challenges these conventions\, inviting the viewer to question the foundations upon which societal structures are built. \nUltimately\, Duvidha is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its folktale origins\, offering a transcendent and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition. With its mesmerizing visuals\, haunting narrative\, and profound themes\, the film continues to resonate with audiences\, inviting them to embark on a journey that blends the fantastical with the deeply human. \n

SUMMARY:ಅಮ್ಮ ಮತ್ತು ಸುಹೇಲ್ | Amma Mattu Suhail
DESCRIPTION:Kannada | 90 minutes | Suitable for Ages 16+  \nThe play is an ode to queer love. It is a meditation on the values of empathy and dialogue as powerful agents to bring estranged minds together. The narrative traverses through moments of passion\, anger\, sadness\, and love in its raw human element. The characters attempt to interrogate\, understand\, and acknowledge each other\, and in this process\, unveil the universality of all emotions as being the same\, irrespective of gender and orientation. The play tries to deconstruct and lay open the psychological and emotional baggage of the characters who are but symbols of the divided humanity that we are today. An interfaith gay couple and the mother of one of the characters venture on a journey of understanding one another rather light-heartedly through uncomfortable conversations\, only to explore depths which they never knew or imagined would be possible to unearth. \n\n\n\n\nPlaywright/Director’s Note: \nWith the drastic change in the political discourse the world has witnessed in the last few years\, one cannot but notice the drastic emergence of an undeniable divide within humanity. There are two segments that appear to be in stark contrast\, constantly struggling and fighting with each other. There is a constant othering and exclusion of minorities by the majority in power. During the pandemic\, the apathy by the political class at large was glaringly visible and we witnessed in full display the class disparity that envelops our nation. The Hindu – Muslim rhetoric was constantly fed to us through public discourse and hate was offered as a staple diet for even those who refused to be part of it. \nThe artist felt compelled to speak up\, believing that love is the only antidote to the vehement poison of hate. They hence decided to write and direct this play that features the love story of a gay couple hailing from the Hindu and Muslim communities. Diversity cannot be celebrated without the intersectionality that makes for the complex mix of the society we are. The play intends to hold the mirror to the microaggressions and biases that consume us all through humor and emotional storytelling. \nWith music\, love\, and humor\, the play tries to unravel the demons of Islamophobia and homophobia in us all. It celebrates the value of empathetic dialogue and honest communication in eradicating hate. Amma mattu Suhail is a tender story of love\, acceptance\, and possibilities. \nThe artist is a classical musician\, writer\, and theatre practitioner\, and their arts practice is always an amalgamation of these elements. They create out of necessity! Having grown up queer and gender fluid\, they struggled to find representation in the Kannada arts scene and were disappointed. They tried to fit in and adapt to the arts “as is” but eventually found it suffocating and had to carve out their own path and create what they wanted to engage with. They strive to bring marginalized voices to the fore and their stories or creations always aim to question and break patriarchal stereotypes and conditioning. Their search is always to find fluidity. Just like their characters either in the plays they have written or in the dance-based compositions they have created\, which always traverse through the non-binary nature of gender identity or sexuality\, the art they create yearns to find fluidity in form and content. They break the structure and form using non-linear narratives\, democratic – secular emotional indulgences\, and fluid emotional paradigms. They attempt to convey the grotesque bizarreness of our social existence with humor and the humorous\, funny realities that define us through the macabre. \nThey always like to begin with an uncomfortable space and establish familiarity with the unfamiliar. Most importantly\, they want their art to be accessible to all class and caste sections of society. They often find it very difficult to mold their form in a way that does not “other” an audience which has no access to learning arts appreciation or delving into abstraction. While they try to abstain from dumbing down their audience\, they make it a priority to make their arts inclusive. Having been in circles where art is created and consumed in the same vicious elitist spaces and circles\, they yearn to connect to a larger canvas. \nHaving written\, produced\, and directed three plays\, their exploration has always yearned to find that fluidity between sound and silence\, prose and poetry\, body and realism. They aim to tell more queer stories which are embraced by the mainstream and more mainstream stories which make the queer community feel that they are “seen”. Whilst they are cognizant of the brutal grays that marginalized voices live in\, they believe we need more positive representation of these marginalized characters. Their younger queer self wanted to watch happy endings and stories of hope and not just suicide and tragedies. They work only on stories which are fictional retellings of lived experiences and also for these stories to be specifically told in Kannada. Regional languages have the power to automatically place these stories in a certain space while also making sure to remove them from only English-speaking elite spaces. They strive to create work which opens itself to a more vulnerable audience who need to hear\, get uncomfortable\, and feel ignited towards a spirit of inquiry through these stories. \nThey will be glad if their art is also entertaining but they will never be okay if it is not activism. \nCredits: \nPlaywright – Direction – Music : Karthik Hebbar\nCast: Dr Seetha Kote\, B V Shrunga\, Arun D T\nLighting: M G Naveen\nProduction Manager: Murali Sreeram\nSubtitles Execution: Chethana Ramesh Srivatsa\nBackstage: Vishak Bharadwaj and Soumya Dixit\nProduced by Dheemahi Theatre \nDheemahi Theatre was born out of the need to create a safe space for new voices. We are a space for the “outsiders”. We have come together to tell stories that have been oppressed and suppressed in other majoritarian spaces. Empathy and humanity are the main focuses of all the work that we create. We as a team thrive on celebrating diversity and secular narratives by exploring and devising new techniques for facilitating these stories. We work around minimalist production setups and maximal internal processes. With a passion for storytelling that transcends boundaries\, we strive to create a stage that reflects the kaleidoscope of human experiences. Our productions are more than performances; they are a canvas of shared narratives that resonate with the richness of our collective journey. We aspire to weave together tales that inspire\, provoke thought\, and unite us in the magic of the theatre. \nSupported by: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n

SUMMARY:Secularism\, Religion and Women
DESCRIPTION:This panel discussion is a conversation between two authors who also share a teacher-student relationship. Nivedita Menon will speak on her latest book\, Secularism as Misdirection\, while Debangana Chatterjee\, her student from Jawaharlal Nehru University\, will present her first book\, Lives of Circumcised and Veiled Women. The intellectual pursuits of two individuals\, which converged in classroom discussions once\, complete a full circle of knowledge creation. The conversation aims to probe religion and secularism using gender as the focal point. \nThe conversation aims to probe religion and secularism using gender as the focal point. Menon’s title alludes to perspectives from the global South and India. In her argument\, secularism performs a “misdirection” as in the performance of a magic trick. It simultaneously hypervisiblises women and religion and obscures caste\, capitalism\, and the non-individuated\, non-rational self.  Chatterjee’s work sheds light on the politics of representation and the process of exoticising women’s bodies in knowledge production; presenting the politics which cloaks the ‘misdirection’. It brings out the intricacies of representational discourses around cultural practices of female circumcision and Islamic veiling. \nThe conversation will be moderated by Rinku Lamba\, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Longen Folk to Go on Pilgrimage
DESCRIPTION:2022 | 88 mins | English with subtitles where necessary | India \nThe film is about what used to be a little-known event until the 1980s but which has now become the single largest annual pilgrimage in India: The Kanwar Yatra. \nThe Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage dedicated to Lord Shiva in which devotees\, known as kanwariyas\, fill water from the river Ganga and carry it back to their hometowns for liberations. The devotees walk anywhere between 100-200 km\, carrying water in Shiva shrines. \nThe film looks at not just the religious and cultural aspects of the Yatra but also its socio-economic impact\, the environmental issues attached to it (for instance\, the state of the Ganga)\, the sheer maleness of the event\, and how the occasion is being used by Hindu right-wing groups to push their majoritarian agenda and the showcase it has become for Hindu nationalism. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with Director\, Kunal Vohra. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n
