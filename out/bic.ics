Curators Prithi Pais and Anshu Arora have worked closely with director\, Padmini Govind to interpret the complex design briefs of the Babbarra women and add their expertise in ethically sourced fabrics\, natural dye and repeat patterns. \nKarri-djarrk-durrkmirri is an example of the beautiful artwork that can be created when Australia and India work together. Twenty-one unique textiles made from 77 individual woodblocks will be displayed. The woodblock designs were created by Bábbarra Women’s Centre artists over 20 years and reinterpreted into woodblocks by Tharangini Studio artisans. The fabric was produced under curatorial direction of Prithi Pais and Anshu Arora and Jessica Stalenberg in liaison with Bábbarra Women’s Centre. The exhibition also features embroidery by Porgai women artisans and two video works by Indian-Australian video artist and filmmaker Naina Sen with photographer Anahita Ananth. \nArtists: Deborah Wurrkidj\, Jennifer Wurrkidj (dec)\, Janet Marawarr\, Raylene Bonson\, Susan Marawarr\, Joy Garlbin\, Helen Lanyinwanga (dec)\, Lucy Yarawanga\, Nancy Gununwanga (dec)\, Carol Liyawanga\,  Abigial Gurawiliwili Namundja\, Ruth Bindiedbal\, Susan Marawarr\, Jay Jurrupula Rostron\, Elizabeth Wullunmingu\, Verity Bangarra and dilly bags by Maningrida Arts \nThe exhibition is open to all\, at the BIC Gallery\, from 4th October to 13th October 2024. Artist talks with visiting artists from Australia will be held on Friday\, 4th October and Saturday\, 5th October at 11:30am. \nThis marks Bábbarra’s second exhibition at BIC\, following their successful Jarracharra (Dry Season Winds) tour across India in March 2023\, supported by the Kolkata Consul-General. \nPresented by: \n \nImage credit: Artist Jennifer Wurrkidj (dec) and Janet Marawarr.

SUMMARY:நடபாவாடை | Nadapaavaadai
DESCRIPTION:60 Minutes | Tamil | Suitable for all ages \nThe play “Nadapaavaadai” centers on a woman who is forced to conduct burial rites for her entire village after the passing of her family member\, who previously performed these duties.  \nDue to social inequality and prevailing customs\, women are rarely permitted to even enter the crematorium. The characters in the play question the lady’s access to the crematorium and her role in carrying out those rituals that are traditionally associated with men. \n The charismatic lady performs the rites by taking the center stage\, with only men allowed to visit the crematorium. She leads the burial rites in full face of the public – which many would be reluctant to undertake or would not be allowed to do.   \n“Nadapaavaadai” attempts to initiate an engaging dialogue about her role in diverse social and cultural contexts and its implications. This play has evolved out of a close observation\, followed by an extensive ethnographic fieldwork\, engaging discussions\, and participatory playmaking. \nDirector’s Note \nCredit List \nCast\nManik Subramanian\nArchana Selvaraj\nAbinaya Jothi\nDevi Devadoss\nTamilarasan \nMusicians\nSuren Sekaran\nSathya Sharath \nLight Design: Suthan \nStage Manager: Nethaji \nTechnical Assistant: Raagul \nDesign and Direction: Ramassamy S \nSupported By: The Perch Collective \nSpecial Thanks: Kumari Amma Rajiv Krishnan \nAbout the Velippadai Theatre Movement: \nVelippadai Theatre Movement was founded as a community initiative in 2013 to develop deep connection with the lives\, sufferings and concerns of the self and others as well\, and to inculcate a new awareness in the rural context of Pondicherry about both tradition and modernity.

SUMMARY:A People's History of the Mughal Empire
DESCRIPTION:Professor Satish Chandra was one of the first historians to shift our attention from the emperors of the Mughal Empire to its people. \nDrawing upon his works\, this lecture highlights the contribution of common people in the formation of the empire. It does this by focusing on two groups that played important roles in the domain of warfare. Firstly\, it investigates the vast numbers of mercenaries and armed peasants who served as foot-soldiers in the armies. They served as guards\, swordsmen\, gunners\, and archers. Secondly\, it studies the pioneers\, carpenters\, stone-cutters\, boatmen\, and other workers who toiled in the domain of military logistics. They built roads\, constructed bridges\, dug tunnels\, and looked after the war-animals in the course of campaigns. It argues that the participation of vast numbers of common people in these two capacities was key to the functioning of the empire. This implies that the empire was not an elite project created only by emperors\, noblemen\, and courtiers. Rather\, it was a broad-based political entity that rested on the work and involvement of vast sections of the South Asian population. \nAbout Prof. Satish Chandra \nProf. Satish Chandra (1922 – 2017) was a leading authority on Medieval Indian History. \nIn a career spanning nearly 40 years\, Prof. Chandra taught history at Allahabad University\, Aligarh Muslim University\, Delhi University\, Rajasthan University\, and finally the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)\, where along with S. Gopal\, Bipin Chandra and Romila Thapar he co-founded the Centre for Historical Studies. \nIn between\, from 1972 to 1980 he was first Vice Chairman and then the Chairman of the University Grants Commission. \nIn 1985\, along with intellectuals like Prof. Nurul Hasan and marine biologist Dr. Zahoor Qasim\, he founded the Society for Indian Ocean Studies which\, among other activities\, brings out the quarterly Journal for Indian Ocean Studies. \nSon of Sir Sita Ram\, India’s first High Commissioner to Pakistan (1947-48)\, Prof. Chandra has\, along with some other JNU historians\, been said to have been a ‘left leaning historian’ who espoused the Marxist approach to history\, and one whose early experiences helped bridge the intellectual gap in interpreting medieval Indian history and modern times. \n

SUMMARY:Puuluup
DESCRIPTION:Puuluup\, consisting of Ramo Teder (also known as Pastacas) and Marko Veisson\, has captivated audiences worldwide with their innovative blend of traditional and modern music. Since their inception in 2014\, they have performed across Estonia and in numerous countries\, including Belgium\, China\, India\, and the United States. Their music\, a unique fusion of the Hiiu kannel (a two to four stringed bowed lyre from northern Europe) with electronic elements\, has garnered significant acclaim\, and they recently represented Estonia at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2024 and will be bringing their music to the acclaimed Jodhpur RIFF festival later this year. \nCrossing Hiiu kannel with electronics\, Puuluup oscillates on the border of tradition and modern music styles\, flirting with world music\, underground and pop. Puuluup controls the vibrations of hiiu kannel’s strings through effect blocks and the looper and uses alternative playing techniques and sound generation options. Electronically amplified echoes\, knocks\, squeaks and scrapes are added to the soft hiss of Hiiu kannel. The music is at times dance-pulsating and at times cinematic and dark\, creeping in and carried over from the chambers of the ancient Vormsi talharpists. It sounds like original creations impregnated with tradition\, references to punk classics and romantic neo-zombie post-folk with educational content. \nIn collaboration with:\n \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:आनंदओवरी | Anandowari
DESCRIPTION:90 Minutes | Hindi (Tukaram abhangs will be sung in Marathi) | Ages 16 years + \nThis play is an adaptation of the seminal Marathi novel ‘Anandowari’ written by D.B. Mokashi in 1974. \nAnandowari (English translation: ‘The Verandah of Bliss’) looks at 17th-century saint poet Tukaram’s story through his younger brother Kanha’s perspective. Tukaram has gone missing again. This time\, though\, the hints seem ominous. We travel through those 3 days of Kanha’s frantic search for Tuka and his many realisations about his brother. \nIn reminiscing about Tukaram\, Kanha tries to grapple with Tuka’s many identities: Tuka his brother\, the son\, the householder\, the creative genius\, a saint\, a reformer\, a rebel. \nThis act of reminiscence becomes an act of grappling with what and who he has lost\, in the process giving us a great psychological insight into the events (personal\, social and political) and impulses that shaped Tukaram’s consciousness and made him who he was: one of the most beloved Bhakti saint poets of Maharashtra\, as tender as he was fierce\, as compassionate as he was unforgivingly harsh\, as much a reformist as he was a transcendentalist. \nOur adaptation focuses on the search that lies at the heart of the text: a devotee in search of God\, a man in search of his brother\, a writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nCredits: \nOriginal Novel Anandowari by D.B Mokashi\nAdaptation and Direction: Gerish Khemani\nHindi Translation: Dr Jaya Dayal\nPerformed by: Varad Salvekar\, Hrishabh Kanti\nBackground Score: Ruturaj Bhosle\nAbhang Composition: Keshav Kudale\nLight Design: Sachin Lele\nLights Operation: Prerana\nPoster and Creatives: Robin Patel \nDirector’s Note: \nWhat interested me personally was the question of the creative consciousness of the saint poet Tukaram\, the source of his poetry\, his metaphysical preoccupations\, his social rebellion\, his love for his beloved God Vitthal. I was interested in finding a device through which I could approach this text. And then it struck me: what would happen if the writer stepped into his own story? His character has found salvation\, what about the writer? How will he? It is an investigation into that search… A devotee in search of God. A man in search of his brother. A writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nThrough two texts – D. B Mokashi’s original Anandowari and my text where Tuka meets Vithal and Mokashi enters his own story – multiple confrontations are imagined. Confrontation between Mokashi (writer) and Kanha (character)\, confrontation between Tuka (devotee) and Vitthal (God). Creator and creation? One writer (Mokashi) searching for another (Tuka)? And then the question prevails: Who gives meaning to the other? Both depend on each other for meaning. For identity. Can there be a God without a devotee? Can there be a writer without her creation? Each validates the other. And each has the power to cancel each other out. \nBut then what if they exchange roles? Or what if this duality itself is the biggest illusion? And so these two texts came to be juxtaposed\, hoping to interpenetrate and illuminate each other. \nOur adaptation of Anandowari reeks of tremendous longing for the absolute and the madness\, pain of creative consciousness and its concomitant search for meaning embodied in the existential desperation of the protagonists. \nWith Support From \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Guardians of the River
DESCRIPTION:Steven Moss\, a British naturalist\, once called the otter “the elusive movie-star”. The apex predator of river and stream ecosystems in India\, the otter is a charismatic and reclusive mammal that has evolved over millennia to adapt brilliantly to its habitat. And yet\, today\, the three species of otters found in India are in a vulnerable spot\, with declining habitat and increasing demand for water placing critical constraints on their continued survival. \nIn this talk\, Gopakumar Menon will make a case for their protection and\, thereby\, the larger case for the preservation of their riparian habitat. \nThe talk will be followed by a panel discussion with conservationist Praneet Goteti and a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Mela Chiraagaa’n | ਮੇਲਾ ਚਿਰਾਗਾਂ | میلہ چراغاں
DESCRIPTION:Mela Chiraagaa’n… \n…a MELA of Sufi kalaam\, woven with music and narration \n…a MELA that brings Hindus\, Sikhs and Muslims together to celebrate a poet from Punjab’s soil \n…a MELA that dissolves boundaries of gender\, caste\, class\, religion \nThe earthy kalaam of 16th century Sufi faqeer Shah Hussain is an inseparable part of Punjab’s soil\, its consciousness\, its ‘khalqat’\, the people of ‘Sanjha’ Punjab. Weaver\, mystic\, poet\, Shah Hussain kept away from ‘peeri’\, ‘meeri’\, all kinds of high sounding titles\, he lives in our hearts as ‘faqeer nimaana’ (the lowly faqeer). \nMela Chiraaga’an Urs is celebrated every year in remembrance of this poet faqeer Shah Hussain and his beloved disciple\, a Hindu Brahmin boy Madho Lal\, as they lie buried in their twin graves near Lahore. So inextricably connected\, Shah Husain is also remembered as Madho Lal Hussain. 2024 marks Madho lal Hussain’s 436th Urs\, his death anniversary\, a celebration of the final union with the beloved divine ( ‘Urus’ in Arabic is a wedding) \nThis Mela\, a confluence of his poetry\, woven with music and narrative\, is his journey as a Julaaha (weaver)\, a ‘malaamati’\, as Faqeer Nimaana\, the lowly faqeer.
