SUMMARY:Mission Young Citizens
DESCRIPTION:Who says children don’t understand civic rights? \nA 13-year-old girl’s drive led to a toilet being built in her village for the first time. A young boy’s call to the municipal corporation fixed a dangerous pothole. When given an opportunity\, young citizens of India are more than capable of bringing about real change. \nThis event will see young change makers talk about their experiences – the challenges\, solutions and vision for the future\, an activity for youngsters to understand the process of how to report to civic authorities followed by a quiz for all ages on India by Quiz Master Berty Ashley. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n  \nWe at BIC have put together a day\, full of events at our Library\, to celebrate the 76th year of the Indian Constitution with kids at the heart of our programmes. Through stories\, quizzes\, and fun-filled sessions\, we aim to get young minds thinking a little bit more in depth about our constitution and country.  \nYou can view the other two events here and here. \n

SUMMARY:The Constitution and its Makers
DESCRIPTION:The Indian Constitution\, which came into force on 26 January\, 1950 was prepared by the Constituent Assembly over a two and a half year period through a process of discussion and debate. There were close to 300 members in the Constituent Assembly. Besides the known members of the Assembly like Dr BR Ambedkar and Jawaharlal Nehru\, several others contributed to the making of the Constitution. \n10 Makers of the Indian Constitution introduces you to some of these makers. What were the lives of these makers like? What were their achievements? What were their contributions to the Constitution and to India in general? There are fascinating stories that lie hidden. \nWe at BIC have put together a day\, full of events at our Library\, to celebrate the 76th year of the Indian Constitution with kids at the heart of our programmes. Through stories\, quizzes\, and fun-filled sessions\, we aim to get young minds thinking a little bit more in depth about our constitution and country.  \nYou can view the other two events here and here. \n

SUMMARY:Nature's Wild Child
DESCRIPTION:India has a unique relationship with the mango. It is all over our cultural life and festivals. Our emotional life and our social existence. Our markets and our countryside. It is the only fruit that is a festival unto itself. Each year\, cities organize their own mango festivals that are extremely popular events. No other fruit seems to have a comparable role anywhere else. The mango seems intimately familiar to almost all Indians\, nay\, all residents of South Asia. Yet we are unaware of the wider role of the mango fruit\, leaves\, flowers\, trees\, orchards and groves in almost every facet of our lives through our known and unknown history. In politics\, economics\, land ownership\, infrastructure\, ecological (and psychological) health\, propaganda\, diplomacy\, ecology\, festivities\, funerals\, weddings\, seduction\, poetry\, the arts\, architecture… \nDrawing from the recently published bestseller Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango\, this discussion will join the ubiquitous excitement around mangoes to look towards avenues untrodden\, histories unconsidered\, festivals abandoned. The event will take place close to the time that marked India’s myriad spring festivals\, the symbol of which was the mango flower. The known mango is a bridge to a lot about us that is either unknown or goes unacknowledged. \nThe author\, Sopan Joshi will be in conversation with Venu Madhav Govindu which will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Do You Know the Story of Your State?
DESCRIPTION:You were born in an Indian state. You live and study in an Indian state. You\, like every other Indian\, call at least one state home. Your state is a big part of your identity. And yet\, do you know the story of how your state was created? \nCome listen to the incredible origin stories of each of India’s twenty-eight states and eight union territories\, spanning from Independence until today.

SUMMARY:Aradhana Saraswati
DESCRIPTION:The concert pays homage to the Goddess Saraswati\, revered through the ages as the embodiment of the four essentials of a discerning human life: Speech (Vaani)\, the foundation of communication and expression; Music (Sangeet)\, the universal language of harmony and emotion; Wisdom (Buddhi)\, the guiding light of understanding and insight; and Discrimination (Vivek)\, the power to discern and choose wisely. \nThrough a journey of timeless raags and original compositions\, our musicians delve into these eternal qualities\, reflecting the grace and profundity that the Goddess represents. This celebration is not just a tribute to Saraswati but a call to connect with the divine essence of creativity\, intellect\, and balance within us all. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Swept Away : Being in the Moment
DESCRIPTION:Despite what many people think\, India is a land of constant change\, innovation and movement. Ephemerality and constant adaptation are woven into Indian philosophies\, religions\, and customs – whether darshan with a deity\, drawing with powdered rangoli or kolams in the early morning\, chanting a mantra\, practicing yoga\, immersing oneself in Aarthi or in offerings to the Divine. Each requires a pause in the rush of daily life. Duty to others\, to society\, and to the future\, is suspended for the moment of being present. \nStephen Huyler has spent his life observing and listening\, mesmerized by these very Indian expressions\, resulting in six illustrated books\, and over 25 museum exhibitions abroad as well as in India. \nThis session draws on Huyler’s book Transformed By India\, exploring his many encounters\, from maharajahs to musicians\, Dalits to Brahmins\, politicians to potters\, from layered traditions to recent innovations\, of India’s momentary arts. \nStephen Huyler will be in conversation with Sandhya Mendonca. This will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:The Thief Who Stole My Heart
DESCRIPTION:This talk by commences by introducing the audience to the sacred bronzes created by a master sculptor around the year 1000\, and suggests that his inspiration may well have been child-saint Sambandar’s opening hymn that hails god Shiva as “the thief who stole my heart.” \nVidya Dehejia explores this sensuous imagery before moving to ask questions of this material that have not been asked before. Where did the Cholas acquire the copper required to cast the many temple bronzes that are solid heavy pieces of metal? Why were the Cholas obsessed with island Sri Lanka? What were the circumstances that permitted the creation of hundreds of temples and vast numbers of sacred bronzes despite the constant warfare that the Chola monarchs were engaged in? What was the source of the extraordinarily vast number of pearls that\, together with coral\, rubies and diamonds\, were embedded in gold jewelry gifted to adorn temple bronzes? Why did the Cholas cover the walls of their temple walls with inscriptions– some 13\,000 in total – using temple walls as if they were the public records office? \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:शून्यता–समानता | Emptiness–Equality
DESCRIPTION:In this musical introduction to The Notbook of Kabir\, Anand will demonstrate how Kabir often translates and improvises on––and returns to––the Buddha. What is the relationship between Sunnyata (शून्यता\, the void) and Samaanta (समानता\, equality)? How does the raga that is nirgun (निर्गुण)\, beyond form and quality (गुण)\, enfold\, embody and inform form\, and help us experience both being and nothingness? \nFollowing a brief performance\, Anand will be in conversation with Kotiganahalli Ramaiah\, poet\, playwright\, translator and song-writer renowned in the Kannada world. \n

SUMMARY:Yogi Mattu Bhogi
DESCRIPTION:90 Minutes | Kannada | For Ages 16 years and above \nYogi Mattu Bhogi is a free adaptation of the 7th-century play\, Bhagavadajjukam (Sanskrit\, ‘bhagavat’ – hermit; ‘ajjuka’ – harlot)\, also known in English as The Ascetic and The Courtesan. One of the oldest surviving plays in Sanskrit literature\, it is a fine example of a ‘prahasana’\, or farce. Layered in witty exchanges about dharma\, it is centered around the transmigration of souls between the two titular characters leading to confusion and chaos for the supporting characters who have no answer to the absurdity of it all. \nThrough this retelling in Kannada\, Mahesh Dattani\, plays around with the idea of gender: its expression\, perception\, spectrum and the exploration of what one truly is with a confrontation of stereotypes using humour and catharsis. Infused with Yakshagana\, the play comes alive when the classic Sanskrit text and the physicality of theatre gels seamlessly with the traditional dance theatre form from coastal Karnataka. \nCredits:\nAdaptation and Direction: Mahesh Dattani\nKannada Translation: Vishvajith Madhavamurthy\nYakshagana Choreography: Guru Bannanje Sanjeev Suvarna\nMusic Composition: Poornima Bhojraj\nSet Design: Mahesh Dattani\nLight Design: Trisha Shetty\, Bhavya Bharadwaj\, Pallavi Kodagu\nLights Execution: Trisha Shetty\, Bhavya Bharadwaj\nCostume Design: Shruti Bangera\nMusic: Amrit P\nProduction Manager: Venumadhav Bhat\n(Initial) Poster Design: Gopalkrishna Bhat\n(Initial) Poster Artwork: Shruti Bangera\nAssistant Directors: Trisha Shetty and Kritika Verma\nProduction Assistants: Atharv Mishra and Amrutha \nAbout Punaha Theatre:\nPunaha\, a theatre company based in Udupi\, is dedicated to the art of storytelling through the transformative power of performance. ‘Punaha’\, is derived from the Kannada (Σನಃ)\, Hindi (पुनः) and Sanskrit word\, meaning “repeat\,” or “to do it again”. They are a group of professional theatre artists\, academicians\, and working professionals who love theatre\, and the idea of repetition and riyaaz involved in it. ‘Punaha’ symbolizes their commitment to revisit and reimagine classic narratives while exploring contemporary themes that resonate with today’s audience. It also is the idea of us as humans trying\, failing but definitely starting again\, starting Punaha. Among their ongoing productions are Girish Karnad’s Agni Aur Barkha (translated into Hindi by Ram Gopal Bajaj) and Harold Pinter’s The Caretaker. Agni Aur Barkha was previously adapted to the stage in Kannada as Agni Mattu Male. Yogi Mattu Bhogi is our fourth production overall in collaboration with Sahitya Akademi awardee\, Mahesh Dattani. Punaha hopes to create a thriving theatre culture in the small coastal city of Udupi\, develop their plays thriftily and tour them to other cities\, big and small. Reflecting the multilinguistic atmosphere of the city\, their intention is to not be bound by the constraints of a single language\, producing plays primarily in English\, Hindi\, and Kannada. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Exploring the Temples of the Deccan
DESCRIPTION:Of all regions of India\, the Deccan has the most diverse architectural traditions\, nowhere better shown than in the variety of stone temples sponsored under a succession of dynasties which ruled peninsular India over some 700 years. To illustrate this unique diversity\, Michell explores religious monuments at lesser-known sites. He begins with Early Chalukya temples overlooking the Tungabhadra river at Alampur\, and ends with the imposing Kakatiya monument at the out of the way village of Palampet\, both in Telangana. In between\, he discusses the Nolamaba period shrines at Nandi and Shravana Belgola\, and those of the Later Chalukyas at Sudi\, Kuruvatti and Lakkundi\, all in Karnataka. He concludes with the little visited Hoysala period shrines at Belavadi\, Mosale and Agraha Bachhahalli. \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A Session with the audience. \nImage credit – Surendra Kumar \nIn collaboration with:\n  \n

SUMMARY:The Earthquake
DESCRIPTION:\n54 minutes | English\, Hindi\, Kannada | Suitable for 13+ Years\nTrigger Warnings: Themes of Loneliness \n\n\n\n\nDo you ever feel alone\, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection\, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week\, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends… Yet\, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together\, drifting apart\, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise… \nThis is an adaptation of “Bhūmikampa – Das Erdbeben” which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all\, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships\, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n“Mira and Sameer find themselves on a bench\, surrounded by unspoken words. ‘The Earthquake’ delves into the essence of human relationships—our connections\, routines\, distances\, and all the spaces in between. It asks us what it means to be truly seen or heard. What happens when we finally face the unspoken truths in our interpersonal relationships?”\n\n\n  \nCredits: \nPlaywrights: Marvin Krause and Samragni Dasgupta\nDirector: Samragni Dasgupta \nCast: \nMira: Yamuna Kali\nSameer: Naman Roy \nThe Earthquake received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt München Kulturreferat (City of Munich). \nProduced by     \n\nWith Support from \n\n \n\n
