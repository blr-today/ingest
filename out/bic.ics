SUMMARY:Architectures of Transition
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Walkthroughs\nWed\, Jan 8 | 4pm – Presentation by Pranav Thole\, followed by a walkthrough by Rahul Mehrotra\nThu\, Jan 9 | 5pm – Presentation by Pranav Thole\, followed by a walkthrough \nThe travelling exhibition displays the works of 41 emergent architecture practices in South Asia that have engaged in the making of architecture\, landscape\, and infrastructure in the public realm. The research offers insights into patronage\, methodologies\, emergent technologies\, and construction techniques and also sheds light on how the humane and social aspects of architecture characterized by participatory frameworks are being approached by practitioners today. It attempts to highlight modes of engagement as well as transgressions and synergies between disparate cultures\, ways of representation\, and knowledge accumulation and production. The first edition of the exhibition was shown at the India International Centre\, New Delhi in December 2023\, followed by the first travel edition at the Alliance Francaise\, Chennai in August 2024. \nThe exhibition is part of the research project – State of Architecture in South Asia\, which aims to collectively ask\, across South Asia\, the question: Does Architecture matter in a state of transition? In the region\, numerous transitions\, and uncertainties\, encompassing climate change\, political transformations\, and socio-economic shifts\, manifest in a heightened form within the daily existence of its populace.  A project initiated by the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute\, Harvard University  and the Architecture Foundation\,  visit https://www.soasouthasia.com for more details on the project. \nThe Travelling exhibition is produced by Prakriti Foundation and the Architecture Foundation \nIn collaboration with: \n    \nSupported by: \n    \n

SUMMARY:K-Art Beyond K-Culture
DESCRIPTION:The Asia Dance Festival is an annual celebration that brings together diverse dance traditions from across Asia. This vibrant event showcases the rich cultural heritage and contemporary dance innovations of various Asian countries\, offering a unique platform for artistic exchange and collaboration. \nThe Korea Dance & Arts Center\, a nonprofit organization\, is focusing on promoting K-Art beyond K-Culture through the Asia Dance Festival\, while strengthening networks through dance in various countries. \nNabimu\nCha Myung Hee (Korea)\nThis dance\, expressing the joy of enlightenment upon hearing the Buddha’s teachings (Dharma)\, is one of the elegant forms of Jakbeop (a traditional Buddhist ritual dance). It involves purifying the sacred space and is accompanied by chants used to honor the Three Jewels (Sambo) and the celestial beings (Cheonryong). \nSeonbi Hagchum (the crane dance of Korean traditional scholars)\nLee Jong Ho(Korea)\nSeonbi Hagchum by Lee Jong-ho is a work that depicts a crane soaring and a seonbi (Korean traditional scholar) dancing\, expressing the pure and clear communion with a crane through the gestures of a seonbi. The seonbi spirit values integrity and frugality above all\, while the crane symbolizes purity and nobility. The hakchangui(鶴氅衣)\, the traditional attire worn by seonbis in their daily lives\, was designed to emulate the white body and black head of a crane. This attire embodies natural beauty and harmony while reflecting the dignified and unyielding character of the seonbi. \nJinju Gyobang Gutgeori Chum\nSeo Jung Sook(Korea)\nThe Jinju Gyobang Gutgeori Dance\, designated as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Gyeongnam Province\, is composed of eight sequences representing the four seasons: spring\, summer\, autumn\, and winter. Rooted in the elegant and artistic tradition of Gyeongsang-do’s Deotbaegi\, this dance combines refined postures and precise footwork derived from Jeongjae (court dances)\, serving as both the driving force and the pinnacle of all its movements\, culminating in improvisation. \nTaepyeongmu\nKwak Myeong Ji (Korea)\nThis piece expresses through dance the wish for the nation’s peace and prosperity\, a sentiment that has been passed down by Kang Sun-young as an officially designated National Intangible Cultural Heritage. Base​d on the shamanic rhythms of the Wangsimni Dang-gut\, it showcases the vibrant and unique footwork\, along with delicate yet precise hand movements\, highlighting the splendor and elegance of traditional Korean folk dance. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Research as Practice
DESCRIPTION:For complex projects in the public realm or at the scale of the city\, actors become clearly differentiated\, and hence the building of constituencies becomes crucial to engage different stakeholders in any project. This is often done through various media to put across ideas\, and it is here that research and writing to communicate ideas of the city become an important part of the practice.  \nIn retrospect\, publications become a way of creating partnerships\, collaborations\, and friendships which serve to keep alive the conversations on the issues at hand and engagement with the work we do. Similarly\, these publications then go out into the world beyond the project and have a life of their own. But\, most critically\, in hindsight they allowed us to expand our ‘sphere of influence’ and equipped us to speculate about the future\, simultaneously creating an archive of the present.  \nThe acts of archiving and reflecting\, as well as simultaneously speculating and being propositional\, are critical for us to gain agency as a profession. For\, by committing to writing\, drawing our speculations\, or even discerning the patterns that surround us gives us agency as professionals in society. If we do not have agency or find ways to establish an agency\, we will break down as a profession.  \nThis lecture will cover 30 years of Rahul Mehrotra’s research and writings in the context of his engagement as a practitioner as well as advocate for various issues concerning Architecture and Urbanism in India. \nIn collaboration with: \n     \nSupported by: \n    \n

SUMMARY:Looking for Bombay/Mumbai/Bambai
DESCRIPTION:This talk looks at a photographic ecology of the working classes in Bombay/Mumbai/Bambai between the 1970s and 1990s by fine art photographers. It asks in what ways this photographic construction of the laboring population looks at questions of alienation\, class\, caste\, and capitalism. It situates these images at a time when the city was witness to the steady decline of the Communist stronghold among the working classes\, moving to embrace the Shiv Sena Party with its anti-migrant rhetoric\, liberalization and deindustrialization after the Great Textile Mill Strike of 1982. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Nehru’s Democracy
DESCRIPTION:This lecture by Madhavan K. Palat\, Secretary of the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund and editor of the forthcoming comprehensive online edition of the Nehru Archives\, explores the complex and often paradoxical dimensions of Nehru’s engagement with democracy. \nNehru presented himself as a liberal and a socialist. Yet\, while he did not explicitly identify as a conservative\, he frequently employed Burkean and traditionalist arguments to legitimize Indian democracy. At the same time\, he repeatedly warned that democracy risked self-destruction through the emergence of a democratic dictatorship or the tyranny of the majority. \nPalat examines how Nehru derived the ethos of democracy from traditional panchayats and 19th-century nationalist movements\, asserting that democracy had become the yugadharma—the defining moral order—after Independence. Nehru insisted that democracy had to be dynamic\, propelled by movements but grounded in stable institutions. When conflicts inevitably arose between these two forces\, he consistently prioritized movement\, seeing it as a continuation of nationalist mobilization\, while institutions embodied the legacy of the Constituent Assembly and its Constitution. \nYet\, Nehru never saw the Constitution as a sacred text. Democracy\, he believed\, could only be safeguarded through democratic practice\, not constitutional rigidity—a stance that effectively repudiated the idea of a “Basic Structure” doctrine. Seeking to deepen democracy\, Nehru championed Panchayati Raj\, arguing that democracy required a broad\, pyramid-like foundation to prevent its collapse. However\, as Palat highlights\, Nehru’s vision was fraught with ambiguities. He viewed panchayats as both democratic and bureaucratic extensions\, expressed dismay over the rise of opportunists in the electoral system\, and feared that democracy was breeding an elective aristocracy and oligarchy. \nNehru lamented the absence of a two-party system in India but keenly observed an ideological dichotomy between Congress and Hindutva\, presciently suggesting that these ideologies could evolve into distinct parties. While Nehru valued moral ideals\, his inspirations—Buddha\, Ashoka\, Akbar\, and Gandhi—were not unequivocal democrats. Gandhi\, though a democratic mobilizer\, was autocratic in his methods. Nehru himself emerged as the most consistent symbol of democratic idealism but rejected the notion of a personality cult as vulgar and absurd. \nPalat’s lecture delves into Nehru’s ambivalence towards democracy: he despised its tendency to favor mediocrity yet feared that inspiration and charisma often led to right-wing politics\, which he deplored. Nehru’s political philosophy lay in reconciling contradictions and embracing ambiguities\, favoring the pragmatism of a conservative over the ideological rigidity of a socialist. \nBy drawing on his extensive work with the Nehru Archives\, Palat offers fresh insights into Nehru’s thought and legacy\, portraying him as a leader navigating the complex interplay of ideals and realities with remarkable dexterity\, even as he remained a figure defined by paradoxes and inconsistencies. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:And\, Towards Happy Alleys
DESCRIPTION:75 mins | Persian\, English | 2023 | India\, Iran \nFascinated by Iran’s film culture and the poetic works of the feminist poet Forough Farrokhzad\, Indian filmmaker Sreemoyee Singh sets out in search of the protagonists of Iranian cinema. Her interactions over six years with filmmakers Jafar Panahi\, Mohammad Shirvani and human rights activist Nasrin Sotudeh\, among others\, depict the precarious situation in which critics of the regime find themselves\, including the constant threat of imprisonment and being banned from practicing their profession. With a keen eye for unusual situations\, she poetically captures the effect of the Islamic Republic’s omnipresent censorship on the daily lives of Iranian women whose uncompromising struggle has put them at the forefront of the protests that are currently rocking the country. \nAnd\, Towards Happy Alleys is a passionate declaration of love for the cinema and poetry of Iran which also provides a frank view of daily life\, and bears witness to a fearless generation raising its voice and implacably demanding its civil liberties. \nInspired by Iranian cinema and the poetry of Forough Farrokhzad\, a young director from India journeys to Tehran to witness how resistance becomes a daily act of survival in Iranian society. Despite stringent censorship of the Islamic Regime\, she collects a series of eloquent and candid interviews with filmmaker Jafar Panahi\, activists and Iranian women. Over six years\, these conversations with the camera capture the simmering anxieties\, fears\, hopes and dreams of a nation on the brink of revolution. \nThe screening will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Forum
DESCRIPTION:As we celebrate 75 years of the Indian Constitution\, this session of The Forum examines a critical question: Are the freedoms enshrined in our Constitution gradually disappearing? This monumental document\, which laid the foundation of India’s democracy\, guarantees fundamental rights that have shaped the nation’s political\, social\, and legal landscape. Yet\, in a rapidly evolving world\, these freedoms face unprecedented challenges. \nIn this session\, we will explore the delicate balance between individual liberties and state authority\, the judiciary’s evolving role in safeguarding rights\, and how constitutional amendments and societal changes impact the freedoms we often take for granted. Through an interactive dialogue\, we will reflect on what it means to uphold these freedoms in an era where they sometimes seem to be under threat. \nWhether you’re a student of law\, a civic enthusiast\, or someone passionate about democracy\, this session invites you to engage with the ideals of the Constitution while critically examining the forces that threaten their endurance. \nThis is the third of our sessions titled\, The Forum\, a series of engaging discussions held at the BIC Library. Our goal is to bring together individuals from all walks of life\, ages 15 to 50\, to discuss topics of importance in a setting that is both informed and informal. Whether you’re passionate about current events\, social issues\, or cultural topics\, The Forum provides a platform for open dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas. Inspired by the ancient Roman forums\, where citizens gathered to discuss and debate the issues of the day\, these sessions aim to revive this tradition of community dialogue. \n

SUMMARY:Our Incredible Inheritance: India’s Plant Wealth
DESCRIPTION:The lecture will explore efforts to engage the public in conserving India’s extraordinary plant diversity. This diversity forms the foundation of our diverse ecosystems\, nourishes us\, sustains our health\, mitigates climate change\, and offers spiritual\, recreational\, and other invaluable benefits. Vijay Thiruvady utilized botanical gardens like Lalbagh to showcase India’s plant wealth and inspire the public to contribute to safeguarding our natural heritage. Professor Bawa will highlight  ATREE’s recent\, innovative initiatives aimed at connecting scientists\, students\, and the general public to the world of plants. These efforts could promote deeper interactions with nature and continue Vijay Thiruvady’s enduring legacy. \nWith this programme\, the Bangalore International Centre remembers the contributions of our member Vijay Thiruvady in three landmark lectures that he gave at the BIC\, on the “Greening of Bangalore” with Girish Karnad and Capt. Prabhala (2015)\, on “Botanical Illustrations” with Nirupa Rao (2019)\, and on “Why Lalbagh Matters” (2021). \nAmong the accounts of our city\, Vijay Thiruvady’s book\, Lalbagh – Sultans’ Garden to Public Park\, published by the Bangalore Environment Trust\, presents the most comprehensive history of Lalbagh written to date. Ranging across five centuries\, it presents a panoramic view from Kempegowda’s flower garden in 1537\, through Haider and Tipu (1760 to 1799)\, to the East India Company years — Scottish army men and surgeons — and over a century by six Kew trained gardeners. The book is based on research from several archives\, including Kew Gardens and the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh\, and of course on Vijay Thiruvady’s intimate knowledge of Lalbagh having conducted inspiring nature walks for over 18 years that were attended by over 15\,000 walkers.  \nVijay Thiruvady was always interested in various aspects of nature and more specifically horticulture. In addition to the Green Heritage Walks in Lalbagh\, he conducted Imperial Colonial Walks in Cubbon Park and Military Heritage Walks at the MEG&C\, and participated in the various activities of Bangalore Environment Trust as a Trustee. These have included the publishing of notable books on Heritage Trees in and around Bangalore and on Devarakadus and Gundutopus in the vicinity of Bangalore.  \nThiruvady spent his early years in Delhi.  His academic interests were pursued at\nSt. Stephen’s College\, Delhi and School of Architecture\, Ahmedabad.  When in Delhi\, he had exposure to the world of nature and environment through association with a number of distinguished people in the field and institutions.  \nHe gave talks on Bangalore\, its environment and history at many institutions\, including the National Institute of Advanced Studies\, Raman Research Institute\, BIC\, Bangalore Club\, National Gallery of Modern Art\, and Azim Premji University. A gifted raconteur\, his encyclopedic knowledge of trees and of Bangalore’s history were conveyed through stories that kindled a love of nature and made his walks\, lectures and books memorable\, connecting with young and old from around the world\, from experts in the field to school children. His passing in August 2023 is a profound loss to the city. \nVijay Thiruvady’s talk on Lalbagh at the BIC\, which has been widely viewed as an introduction to the botanical garden and to Bangalore and its history\, is available here.  \nHis short essays on trees are available here. \nAn article about him in Frontline magazine is available here. \nImage Captions \nThumbnail and Poster: Impatiens and Primula species from the Himalaya  \nHeader and Instastory: Rhododendron arboreum in the Himalaya  \n  \nTea will be served at 11 am. \n

SUMMARY:Out of the Middling Middle
DESCRIPTION:Midlife is a phase when we find ourselves pulled in multiple directions—across work\, home\, health\, friendships\, and hobbies. \nIn this session\, Ravi Venkatesan delves into themes from Deepak Jayaraman’s recent book\, Play to Potential. The book offers a nuanced exploration of how to unlock human potential—not just professionally but holistically—by embracing life’s highs and lows. Drawing from his acclaimed Play to Potential podcast and his experiences as a coach\, Deepak introduces the FLAVOUR framework\, a practical guide to navigating the intricate interplay of family\, aspirations\, values\, and relationships. \nDeepak emphasises that life is a team sport\, with family serving as an essential support system. He argues that personal growth and achievement are deeply intertwined with our family contexts\, a perspective often overlooked in self-help literature\, particularly in cultures where family plays a central role. \nA key insight of the book is the recognition that life unfolds in seasons\, shaped by transitions—some intentional\, others unexpected. Using real-life examples and case studies\, Deepak illustrates how navigating these transitions thoughtfully is vital to realising our potential. \nThis discussion will resonate with anyone in their 30s to 60s\, offering valuable strategies to lead a multi-dimensional\, purposeful life. \n
