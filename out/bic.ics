SUMMARY:Outsmarting Outbreaks
DESCRIPTION:In our history\, infectious diseases have had and continue to have devastating consequences.  The extension of the human lifespan in the 20th century came from our ability to control the scourges of the past\, smallpox\, tuberculosis\, plague and malaria through safer water and sanitation\, drugs and vaccines. Science transformed society\, but with climate change\, new threats can and will emerge. From data and modelling to emerging technologies\, as the world’s most populous country\, India needs to be prepared for its people and the world. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University’s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Nakshatra
DESCRIPTION:Violinists Trina Basu and Arun Ramamurthy present their debut album\, Nakshatra. This lush and spiritual collaboration bridges traditions and defies genres\, blending South Indian classical music\, Western chamber music\, and jazz improvisation. The album’s title\, a Sanskrit word for constellations and interconnectedness\, encapsulates its expansive sound\, created by two violins in sublime harmony. \nNakshatra is a cinematic work that conveys a sense of two souls conversing across centuries. Rooted in diverse musical traditions\, Trina and Arun reimagine the potential of string chamber music with a unique sound described by The New Yorker as “free-flowing and globe-spanning\,” and by The Guardian as resonating “with the power of an ancient drone\, revivified by a fearless\, contemporary spirit.” This album\, five years in the making\, is a testament to the duo’s fluency in improvisation\, offering a deeply intimate yet grand musical experience. Join us for an evening that promises to be both introspective and expansive\, celebrating the intricate interplay of two violinists. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Time Within Time
DESCRIPTION:HS Shivaprakash’s new book of poetry\, ಮಹಾಕಾಲ | Mahakala\, consists of poems that articulate experiences beyond the time of history and the time of the unconscious. \nWritten during home confinement following the covid tragedy\, these poems seek to break out of the paralyzing hold of historical time to rearticulate still time\, and also express the light and beauty of the spirituality hidden away in the folds of darkness within darkness.

SUMMARY:ಭಾಷಾಂತರ | Bhāshāntara
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a dawn breaking over tranquil waters\, where the melodious voice of a boatman carries across the shore\, ferrying both people and stories from one world to another. This is the essence of Bhāshāntara\, a unique literary event where words become the vessel that transports us across cultures\, emotions\, and experiences. More than just a translation of language\, Bhāshāntara—meaning “translation” in several Indian languages—is a journey of ideas that spans hearts and minds\, creating connections through the power of literary dialogue. \nAt Bhāshāntara\, you’ll witness dynamic exchanges between writers as they respond to each other’s work in real-time\, their words echoing like calls across distant lands. This is not a passive experience; it’s an invitation to immerse yourself in a vibrant community of literature lovers. From emerging talents to established wordsmiths\, the diverse perspectives on stage promise to spark inspiration and foster understanding across cultural divides. \nThis edition of Bhāshāntara showcases two remarkable voices in contemporary Kannada literature: Dadapeer Jyman and Rajendra Prasad. These authors\, each in their own distinct way\, cut through conventional narratives with the precision of a scythe through wheat. Their words resonate with singular clarity\, offering perspectives that not only challenge complacency but also unveil a kaleidoscope of new possibilities in the literary landscape. \nJyman and Prasad engage in an exchange where they respond to each other in poetry – their own and otherwise – extending into a thought-provoking dialogue. These accomplished writers will not only respond to each other’s writings but also delve into their creative processes\, offering attendees a rare glimpse into the craft of contemporary Kannada literature. Their conversation promises to bridge different styles\, experiences\, and cultural perspectives\, embodying the true spirit of Bhāshāntara. \nLike the boatman’s song at dawn\, let the voices of writers carry you across the waters of imagination and connection. This is our renewed attempt at a celebration of the human spirit expressed through literature in all its forms as we prepare to embark on a journey that will resonate long after the last word is spoken. \n

SUMMARY:From Thought to Action
DESCRIPTION:Magsaysay Award-winning social activist Aruna Roy’s memoir is the story of two parallel journeys—a fifty-year-long engagement with public action in India\, and a personal narrative that traces how the author has striven to convert her ideological convictions into practice. \nFor long decades\, Aruna Roy has lived with and worked for the benefit of marginalised communities in rural India\, fighting for the right to survive in a hostile environment. Alongside accounts of the plight of the vulnerable and the transformative power of mass-based grassroot social movements\, her recollections are marked with stories of resilient individuals and communities and their extraordinary resistance to oppression. Roy recounts a powerful lesson learnt from her extraordinary life: that every issue\, whether it is poverty\, discrimination\, inequality or corruption\, has personal as well as political ramifications. It is only by connecting the personal and the political\, Roy says\, that each one of us can make a difference. \nIn this session\, Aruna Roy will be in conversation with Aakar Patel\, alongside TM Krishna\, Deepa Ganesh and Gautam Bhan. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nTea will be served from 5 pm onwards. \n

SUMMARY:Vahuvachan
DESCRIPTION:There are songs written by poets\, saints and artists based on thought provoking phrases found in epics\, shastras and other ancient literary works. These songs inspire dancers to expand and interpret the ideas to create dances. These dances are timeless\, and hold the audience and dancers together. Sharmila Biswas brings four such dances to the audience of Bangalore. \nVilasini: Reminiscence of an old temple dancer of Puri. \nKundalika: Designing spirals in space and in body. \nMaya-Manav: Man’s eternal quest for the unattainable. \nEvoking Radha: A fantasy world\, which every woman longs for\, while living her mundane life. \nThe special treatment given to each makes these four dances interesting. The high spirited and humorous old Devdasi describing her fineries\, a dancer connecting the inner spirals with the outer\, exploration of traditional theatre styles of Odisha\, combining Vachik Abhinaya with dance\, are some of the highlights of Vahuvachan. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Confronting Capitalism
DESCRIPTION:What went wrong with capitalism? Ruchir Sharma’s account is not like any you will have heard before. He says progressives are right\, in part\, when they mock modern capitalism as “socialism for the rich.” For a century\, governments have expanded in just about every measurable dimension\, from spending to regulation and the scale of financial rescues when the economy wobbles. The result is expensive state guarantees for everyone—bailouts for the rich\, entitlements for the middle class\, welfare for the poor. \nTaking you back to the 19th century\, Sharma shows how completely the reflexes of government have changed: from hands-off to hands-on\, from doing too little to help anyone in hard times to today trying to prevent anyone suffering any economic pain\, ever. Trading sins of omission and indifference for excesses of spending and meddling\, governments from the United States to Europe and Japan have pumped so much money into their economies that financial markets can no longer invest all that capital efficiently. \nInadvertently\, they have fueled the rise of monopolies\, “zombie” firms\, and billionaires. They have made capitalism less fair and less efficient\, which is slowing economic growth and fueling popular anger. The first step to a cure is a correct diagnose of the problem. Capitalism has been badly distorted by constant government intervention and the relentless spread of a bailout culture. Building an even bigger state will only double down on what ruined capitalism in the first place. \nThe author\, Ruchir Sharma\, will be in conversation with Chairman and Co-founder\, Infosys and Founding Chairman UIDAI (Aadhaar)\, Nandan Nilekani. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Beyond Story
DESCRIPTION:Friday | Aug 23 | 6:30 pm onwards\nSaturday | Aug 24 | 10:30 am onwards\nSunday | Aug 25 | 10:30 am onwards \nStories dominate our lives\, whether in books\, films\, religion or politics. Ideas and thoughts seem to become palatable only when they are contained within stories with strong characters and tightly woven plots. Of late\, even non-fiction filmmakers tend towards single-character narratives\, with clearly defined three-act structures. \nBeyond Story explores an alternative – the essay film – over three days of interactive sessions with filmmakers and film scholars. \nSchedule: \n\n\n\n\nFriday | Aug 23\nSaturday | Aug 24\nSunday | Aug 25\n\n\n10:30 am\n\nScreening: \nNight and Fog\nby Alain Resnais\n1956 | 32 mins \nLa Jetée\nby Chris Marker\n1962 | 28 mins\nScreening: \nLooking for Horses \nby Stefan Pavlovic\n2021 | 88 mins\n\n\n12:15 pm\n\nTalk: \nDigital Afterlives of Films\nChloé Galibert-Laîné\nRitika Kaushik\nTalk: \nEat your Mother and Father\nYashaswini Raghunandan \n \n\n\n02:30pm\n\nTalk: \nThe making of an Essay Film – Impetus and Discovery\nSameera Jain\nTalk: \nEssay Film and the Voice\nMathew Barrington \n \n\n\n04:30 pm\n\nScreening: \nI Am Yet to See Delhi \nby Humaira Bilkis\n2014 | 19 mins \nJamnapaar\nby Abhinava Bhattacharyya\n2017 | 24 mins \nChadariya\nby Nimisha Srivastava\n2022 | 25 mins \n(Films from the Creative Documentary Course\, SACAC\, New Delhi)\\nTalk: \nNon-Narratives with Conceptual Extensions\nVasanthi Mariadass \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n06:30 pm\nTalk: \nImage and Sound as Text\nAvijit Mukul Kishore \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \nScreening: \nTales from Planet Kolkata by Ruchir Joshi\n1993 | 38 mins\nFollowed by a discussion with the Director. \n  \n  \n \nScreening: \nNight and Fear (Raati O Bhaya) by Lipika Singh Darai\n2023 | 28 mins\nFollowed by Q&A with the Director. \nLetter From Your Far-off Country by Suneil Sanzgiri\n2020 | 17 mins \nGolden Jubilee by Suneil Sanzgiri\n2021 | 19 mins\n\n\n\nDay 1\n23 August | Friday \n6:30 pm\nImage and Sound as Text\nA Talk by Avijit Mukul Kishore\nFilm is a temporal art form that employs multiple registers of image\, sound\, music and memory to make meaning. This talk will feature in-depth analysis of short films and excerpts from longer essay films in different genres that include actuality\, observational documentary\, found-footage film and autobiography\, to look at the complex ways in which film’s formal elements come together to create meaning while drawing on our lived experience. \nDay 2\n24 August | Saturday \n10:30 am\nScreening: Night and Fog\nAlain Resnais | 1956 | 32 mins\nThis poignant and harrowing documentary reflects on the horrors of Nazi concentration camps\, blending historical footage with contemporary observations to evoke the stark reality of genocide and the importance of remembering its lessons. \nScreening: La Jetée\nChris Marker | 1962 | 28 mins\nIn a post-apocalyptic future\, a man is sent back in time to explore the past and find a way to save humanity\, but his journey leads him to an unexpected and haunting conclusion. This innovative sci-fi short film is told almost entirely through still photographs.\n \n12:15 pm\nDigital Afterlives of Films\nTalks by Chloé Galibert-Laîné and Ritika Kaushik\nChloé Galibert-Laîné: In this deeply personal video diary\, a young researcher tries to make sense of her fascination for the film “The Pain of Others” by Penny Lane. A deep dive into the discomforting world of YouTube and online conspiracies\, that challenges traditional notions of what documentary cinema is or should be.\nRitika Kaushik: Ritika Kaushik will consider the video essay as a form for examining the digital afterlives of films from the past. Kaushik’s talk will take us through her formal experiments with online and desktop interactions and how they can enliven archival and contemporary digital materials to bring out new configurations of film historiography. She will specifically discuss the ‘reaction video’ as an essayistic technique for creating an embodied and affective engagement with pre-existing audiovisual media. \n2:30 pm\nThe making of an Essay Film – Impetus and Discovery\nA Talk by Sameera Jain\nStemming from a practitioner’s perspective\, the session looks at some recent short films and traces their journeys of making. We find that the form appears through a search for a relationship with image\, sound\, time\, meaning and affect\, a pursuit that is not governed by existing formulations\, but by the creative processes in practice. The talk will attempt to unpack phases in these navigations and present how the cinema essay is ‘found’\, reflecting on the openness\, expanse\, fluidity and inclusivity of the form. In addition\, referencing contemporary and historical cinema\, we explore facets of the essay film\, walking through with some examples. \n4:30 pm\nScreening: Films from the Creative Documentary Course\, SACAC\, New Delhi\n• I Am Yet to See Delhi by Humaira Bilkis | 2014 | 19 mins\n• Jamnapaar by Abhinava Bhattacharyya | 2017 | 24 mins\n• Chadariya by Nimisha Srivastava | 2022 | 25 mins \n6:30 pm\nScreening: Tales from Planet Kolkata\nRuchir Joshi | 1993 | 38 mins\nTales from Planet Kolkata anticipates the period Calcutta was approaching in the early 90s: the wasteland of violent traffic\, the orgy of rampant construction\, the severing of old traditions\, the rise of cynical politics\, the strange\, once again subservient relationship with the west. Seeing it today\, it’s startling how much of it still resonates with the city Calcutta/Kolkata has become. Part fiction\, part spoof\, part essay\, part documentary\, the film weaves together disparate strands: a critique of Western media’s construction\, from the 1960s to the 1990s; of Calcutta as ‘the black hole’ and ‘the worst place in the world’; an ‘elegy’ to Deepak Majumdar\, one of  Calcutta’s great intellectual mavericks\, a teacher and friend to Joshi and many others\, who died while the film was being made; and the images and song of a patua – a traditional Bengali scroll-painter. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with the director\, Ruchir Joshi. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nDay 3\n25 August | Sunday \n10:30 am\nScreening: Looking for Horses\nStefan Pavlovic | 2021 | 88 mins\nTravelling to Bosnia in search of his origins\, filmmaker Stefan Pavlović meets a solitary fisherman. One man has language impairment\, the other lost his hearing during the war. Camera in hand\, the director films the onset of this improbable and profound friendship. \n12:15 pm\nEat your Mother and Father\nA Talk by Yashaswini Raghunandan\nIn this session we will look at how filmmakers weave in their families and themselves to expand the conversations around identity\, alienation and political histories. Through the films ‘Looking for Horses’ by Stefan Pavlovic\, ‘Will you look at me?’ by Shuli Huang and ‘A picture of you’ by Ajay Naronha\, we will look at how the essay is constructed through the making of the film\, revealing an intimate side of filmmaking. All three filmmakers use filmmaking as a method to ask difficult questions and to re-connect\, allowing for some form of catharsis. \n2:30 pm\nEssay Film and the Voice\nA Talk by Matthew Barrington\nIn this session we explore the complexities of voice as both a narrative device and a vehicle for personal expression\, as we examine its transformative power in shaping cinematic discourse. From subjective introspection to objective analysis\, we unpack how the voice navigates the intricate intersections of truth\, perspective\, and interpretation within the essay film landscape. The voice as subjective – departing from a dominant\, authoritative narrator. \n4:30 pm\nNon-Narratives with Conceptual Extensions\nA Talk by Vasanthi Mariadass\nVisual essays are noted for non-narrative style. A re-editing to re-narrate stories untold or less told. I engage with works by Ursula Biemann\, and Harun Farocki\, to examine their theoretical insertions through the visual form.  I would not just call them visual essays but an unfolding of visual theory.  Images collide or they are quietly juxtaposed\, despite the events and topics coming from different spaces\, times\, and seemingly unrelated topics/images\, hence refreshing found images and concepts. Conceptual works by Biemann relate to Environmental concerns and Farocki’s concept examines an already established idea such as the enlightenment but rethinks and retells other not-so-visible concepts such as perfection and precision that silently negotiate the development of scientific and technological production. \n6:30 pm\nScreening: Night and Fear (Raati O Bhaya)\nLipika Singh Darai | 2023 | 28 mins\nThe residuals of recorded material generated by the filmmaker over a decade of filmmaking practice\, with the passing of time\, have acquired new meaning. With a range of experiences – from a local witch hunt to a meeting with a stunning waterfall – the past\, the present\, the fear and the intuitive self\, have found shelter in the characters and spaces from the world captured through image and sound which have aged just enough to correlate and run a parallel narrative. Having a twofold interior\, Night and Fear is a personal essay addressed to the filmmaker’s late grand aunt\, but also a reflection on the impact of making films – on the filmmaker herself and the society. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by Q&A with the Director. \nScreening: Letter From Your Far-Off Country\nSuneil Sanzgiri | 2020 | 18 mins\nShot with 16mm film stock that expired in 2002—the same year as the state-sponsored anti-Muslim genocide in Gujarat—and filmed amid the anti-CAA protests in Delhi\, the filmmaker traces lines and lineages of ancestral memory\, poetry\, history\, songs\, and ruins from his birth in 1989. \nScreening: Golden Jubilee\nSuneil Sanzgiri | 2021 | 19 mins\nWhat is liberation when so much has already been taken? Who has come for more? ‘Golden Jubilee’\, takes as its starting point scenes of the filmmaker’s father navigating a virtual rendering of their ancestral home in Goa\, India\, created using the same technologies of surveillance that mining companies use to map locations for iron ore in the region. A tool for extraction and exploitation becomes a method for preservation. The father\, sparked by a memory of an encounter as a child\, inhabits the voice of a spirit known locally as Devchar\, whose task is to protect the workers\, farmers\, and the once communal lands of Goa. Protection from what the filmmaker asks. \nIn collaboration with: \n          \n  \n

SUMMARY:Khooni Vaisakhi
DESCRIPTION:105 years ago\, on April 13\, 1919\, British troops\, under the command of General Reginald Dyer\, opened fire on a crowd of unarmed Indians who had assembled in Jallianwala Bagh in Punjab. Over a thousand people were killed and wounded during the massacre but 22-year old Nanak Singh miraculously survived and wrote Khooni Vaisakhi\, a searing ballad with twenty-four poems providing a remarkable chronological account of events during the first fortnight of April 1919. \nFormer Ambassador Navdeep Suri\, the grandson of the legendary Punjabi poet Nanak Singh\, along with songwriter and musician Harpreet\, will perform pieces from their musical album based on Nanak Singh’s Khooni Vaisakhi. \nSupported by:\n \n
