SUMMARY:367. Taking the Temperature of Society
DESCRIPTION:The fiercest wars are fought between siblings. \nTara\, a successful Delhi lawyer\, is everything her younger brother isn’t: dedicated\, independent\, thriving. When their beloved father retires\, he summons them to a meeting. But what he has to say threatens to tear the family apart. Tara’s friend Lila has it all: a great job\, a lovely home\, a beautiful family. \nBut when Lila’s father dies unexpectedly\, her brother wastes no time in claiming what he thinks is his. Together\, Tara and Lila are forced to confront the challenge that their ambition poses to patriarchal Delhi society. Set against a backdrop of ecological collapse and political unrest\, The Tiger’s Share is both a family and a state-of-the-nation novel. \nThe Tiger’s Share\, Keshava Guha’s incisive new novel unravels sibling rivalries set against the backdrop of a rapidly changing India. Guha’s storytelling transforms personal conflicts into a lens for examining societal upheavals – from shifting family loyalties to the pressures of urban ambition. \nIn collaboration with: \n  \nIn this episode of BIC Talks\, Keshava Guha will be in conversation with Vikek Shanbhag. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in April 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere\, including Apple Podcasts\, Spotify\, Google Podcasts\, Castbox\, Overcast\, Audible\, and Amazon Music. \n

SUMMARY:Blueprints of Strength
DESCRIPTION:This session offers a deep and reflective exploration of India’s journey toward self-reliance in defence research and development\, inspired by the DRDO publication “Endeavours in Self-Reliance: Defence Research 1983–2018”\, by KG Narayanan. The book captures a critical period of transformation in India’s defence landscape\, chronicling key achievements\, institutional efforts\, and the steady march toward technological autonomy over three and a half decades. \nThe session will open with a keynote presentation by Mr. Narayanan\, who will outline the central themes and insights drawn from the book. This includes the evolution of DRDO’s role\, the emergence of indigenous capabilities\, and the broader strategic imperative of self-reliance in defence. The presentation will set the stage for a nuanced conversation about the motivations\, challenges\, and breakthroughs that have defined India’s R&D efforts in the defence sector. \nFollowing the keynote\, a panel discussion will bring together eminent voices who have been closely involved in shaping this journey. Dr Samir V. Kamat\, Chairman DRDO and Secretary\, Department of Defence R&D; Dr S. Christopher\, former Chairman DRDO; and Dr Anantha Krishnan M\, senior defence journalist and author\, will engage in a dynamic exchange of perspectives. The discussion will be moderated by Air Marshal (Retd.) P Rajkumar\, providing context and continuity across decades of institutional memory and technological evolution. \nTogether\, the panel will reflect not only on past achievements but also on the pressing needs and strategic directions for the future\, offering valuable insights into what it will take to secure and sustain a truly self-reliant defence ecosystem in India. \n

SUMMARY:And a Story Came Tumbling Down...
DESCRIPTION:What happens when you tumble down a hill and land on a secret? \nBased on a true story of a botanist who accidentally rediscovered a rare orchid in the forests of Tamil Nadu. The session begins with a live reading of Botanist and the Vanishing Orchid\, a comic inspired by real events followed by a hands-on workshop where participants complete a comic of their own. With some panels already illustrated and others left blank\, you get to imagine the characters\, twist the plot\, and decide how the tale ends. \n

SUMMARY:Tarana vs Thillana
DESCRIPTION:Tarana and Thillana—two strikingly vibrant forms in Hindustani and Carnatic classical traditions—share more than just syllabic play and rhythmic flair. Yet\, they are often misunderstood\, conflated\, or heard in isolation. \nThis workshop invites participants to explore the shared pulse and divergent expressions of these two forms. Through live demonstrations\, guided listening\, and cross-cultural comparison\, we will experience the same raga unfold as a Tarana and a Thillana\, tracing how it transforms in structure\, tempo\, and mood across styles. \nThe session will introduce key rhythmic devices like layakari\, jatis\, and tihais\, explore improvisation techniques in each tradition\, and unpack the role of these forms in both concert and dance settings. Alongside a deep listening experience\, participants will also gain a historical understanding of how Tarana and Thillana evolved and how they continue to be shaped by performance and pedagogy today. \nLed by expert practitioners from both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions\, this workshop is designed for listeners\, learners\, dancers\, and musicians alike—anyone curious to hear\, feel\, and understand rhythm as language and lineage. \n

SUMMARY:Step In the Frame
DESCRIPTION:This two-piece contemporary dance performance explores the body’s inner battles and breakthroughs. While one piece unravels self-doubt; the other captures the pulse of transformation. \nMetamorphosis \nThe dancers explore the reactions of what happens when one goes through the process of transformation. How does one’s body’s senses and feelings react through this unending loop between creation of new patterns\, destruction\, and recreation of one another. Metamorphosis dives deep into the question of how a pattern impacts the body? And during the period of transition when old patterns are fading away and the new self is finding its expression in the world\, what is then your relationship to the changed self\, and how does your body respond to this change? What is this new self? Is it an add-on to the old pattern or a breakaway into something new? \nLost in Oscillation \nThis piece carries us into the surreal world of self-doubt; shifting\, strange\, and deeply personal. The dancer moves through a dreamlike space\, where self-doubt becomes a physical presence that twists the body and unsettles the mind. Reflections fragment across the stage\, echoing the dancer’s inner conflict. Movements swing between sharp tension and quiet stillness\, capturing the push and pull of uncertainty. With haunting sound and abstract visuals\, the piece invites you into a world where even your own reflection feels unfamiliar. It’s not just a performance—it’s a glimpse into the shifting terrain of the self. \nThe peformance will be followed by a short interaction with the audience. \nSupported by: \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:You Can Change Friends but Not Neighbours
DESCRIPTION:India’s foreign policy towards Pakistan reflects the reality that while friends may change\, neighbours are permanent. Dialogue\, deterrence\, and diplomacy remain key.

SUMMARY:Unfolding Memory: Many People\, Many Desires
DESCRIPTION:45 minutes | English\, Kannada\, Tamil\, Malayalam and Hindi with English subtitles | 2004 \nAs part of BIC’s Pride Programs\, this session will include a screening of T Jayashree’s Many People\, Many Desires\, followed by a panel discussion with T Jayashree\, Mira Brunner and Siddharth Narrain. \nMany People\, Many Desires is centered around the interviews of many members of the LGBTQ community in Bangalore at the time. The film was shot entirely in a MiniDV tape format. Starting from an exploration of sexuality and human rights\, it allows the viewer to hear the first-person narratives of some of those who were engaged with the sexuality movement of the time – whose work is instrumental for the fight for legal rights for queer people in India. \nUsing legal discrimination against sexual minorities as its starting point\, the film explores the relationship between class\, sexuality\, and gender. The film captures early years in the movement against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code\, a colonial law which criminalized homosexual behavior and has now\, through efforts which included some of those interviewed in the film\, been read down. \nThe panel will talk about what has changed\, what has remained the same\, and QAMRA’s (the Queer Archive of Memory\, Reflection\, and Activism) attempts to preserve this history. They will discuss their perspectives on archiving queer material and the responsibilities of preserving what is still in living memory. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis year\, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is — unconforming\, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates\, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society\, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression. Pride\, Insists Upon Itself! \n

SUMMARY:The Third Moment
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the promise of equal citizenship begins to fade for one of the world’s largest Muslim populations? In today’s India\, the question is no longer theoretical\, but urgent and deeply personal for over 200 million people. \nThis session explores the shifting political landscape of Indian Muslims through the lens of Shikwa-e-Hind\, the new book by political scientist Mujibur Rehman. He examines what he calls their “third political moment\,” a phase marked by the erosion of constitutional equality and the rise of a majoritarian ethos since 2014. Tracing the arc from the aftermath of 1857\, through the hopeful vision of 1947\, to today’s polarised climate\, Rehman invites a critical look at the future of democratic participation for Indian Muslims. \nThe conversation features Mujibur Rehman in dialogue with author and columnist Aakar Patel and moderated by journalist Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed. They will explore the tension between constitutional ideals and majoritarian pressures\, the structural challenges of representation\, and the possibilities for reclaiming dignity\, rights\, and democratic participation for Indian Muslims. The session will conclude with a Q&A\, offering space for your questions in what promises to be an inclusive and engaging discussion. \n

SUMMARY:Two Many Things
DESCRIPTION:Many Things is a cross genre instrumental trio\, treading the fine line between composition and improvisation. The inventive tapestry of sound and music takes the listener on a journey full of twists and turns. \nTheir second album Two Many Things is still about the development of ideas in sound – spontaneous and instantaneous – but the compositional element is more pronounced\, with emphasis on structure\, where soloistic endeavors happen in a collective space. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Precarious Lives\, Fraught Selves
DESCRIPTION:Thanuja: A Memoir of Migration and Transition is the first memoir by a Sri Lankan Tamil transwoman who is now a German citizen. The recently published English translation has been gaining attention across social media for its powerful account of gender\, displacement\, and resilience across continents. \nThis session reflects on the layered process of translating Thanuja Singam’s life story\, not only across languages but also across histories\, geographies\, and identity formations. In placing the memoir in dialogue with the expanding field of Indian trans literature\, the discussion opens up questions around how language shapes identity\, how trans voices find space on the page\, and how literary traditions both support and constrain such narratives. \nThe conversation will engage with the evolving landscape of trans writing in South Asia\, examining the literary\, political\, and affective threads that connect diverse trans experiences. It also considers how translation can serve as a bridge between communities\, turning individual testimony into collective memory. \n

SUMMARY:The History of Welfare
DESCRIPTION:Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press\, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day\, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment\, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India’s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development\, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of ‘direct benefits’ which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session\, Louise Tillin\, the author of the book\, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair\, NLS.  \n
