SUMMARY:The Making of a Campus
DESCRIPTION:The design of the IIM Bangalore (IIMB) campus has evolved through contributions from multiple architects over time\, yet its adaptable built and open spaces seem to have allowed it to develop into a cohesive and integrated entity. The book The Making of a Campus: IIM Bangalore shares how this campus came into being and how it has been experienced over time. Through its pages\, the book reveals the thought processes\, design philosophies\, and the interplay between architecture and community that have contributed to the campus’s continuing appeal and functionality. \nUsing the book as a starting point\, the session will explore how a shared design philosophy has imbued the campus with a sense of timelessness. This project\, conceived and executed by architects Balkrishna Doshi and Achyut Kanvinde with subsequent additions by Sanjay Mohe & Medappa\, stands as a testament to the enduring design. \nThe session will commence with an introduction by the book’s author\, Kiran Keswani\, followed by insights from Bijoy Ramachandran\, who has produced two documentary films on Doshi. Subsequently\, architects Sanjay Mohe and Medappa will present their contributions to the campus design\, sharing their discoveries\, challenges\, and outcomes. The event will conclude with a dialogue on ‘creative collaboration’ among the speakers and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n             \n

SUMMARY:Seed Stories
DESCRIPTION:2024 | 42 minutes | Odiya\, Kui\, English with English subtitles | India \nIn a village in the Niyamgiri mountains of Odisha’s Eastern Ghats\, a heroic effort is underway. Barefoot ecologist Dr. Debal Deb and his 3 member-team are conserving in-situ over 1000 endangered heirloom varieties of rice. \nOdisha’s Eastern Ghats region is one of the world’s surviving biodiversity hotspots\, with Adivasi (Indigenous) communities like the Kondhs possessing the knowledge of growing multiple crops with their folk seeds\, evolved over centuries. At the same time\, the village and the wider region is irreversibly changing with the coming of genetically modified cotton seeds and associated chemicals. \nSeed Stories takes a worm’s eye view of how this is reshaping a geography and a people steeped in agro-ecological knowledge\, and altering their attitudes towards farming\, food and ecology. It invites audiences to reflect on the question\, ‘What is sustainability?’ \nCredits\nDirector & Camera: Chitrangada Choudhury\nAssociate Director: Aniket Aga\nEditor: Ajay TG\nSound: Asheesh Pandya\nColourist: Srikanth Kabothu \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Mahatma Gandhi Vastrodyama
DESCRIPTION:Recognising the potential of the handloom sector to provide sustainable employment and meet the growing demand for handloom fabric\, the Government of Karnataka introduced ‘Mahatma Gandhi Vastrodyama’\, a liaison between weaver co-operatives\, producers\, and the market\, in last year’s budget. However\, this project has not progressed beyond a few meetings and the initial proposal stage. Meanwhile\, the past year has seen the condition of handloom weavers decline further\, reaching a state of emergency. Without proper access to markets and design interventions\, they are unable to realise the true value of their traditional skills. \nAs we face increasing natural disasters\, periods of flood and drought\, and the looming climate catastrophe\, ecologically sustainable rural industries such as handlooms and khadi can provide sustainable employment opportunities without harming nature. On Handloom Day\, we hope to rekindle this discussion and draw attention to this critical issue. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Layam in Trinity Compositions
DESCRIPTION:“Shruthi Maatha\, Laya Pitah” is a famous saying where Shruthi and Layam are seen as two most important fundamentals of music. Layam is a basic rhythm that flows through any movement\, expressed as Thaalam (beats). There is an implicit Layam and explicit Layam. The former is something that has to be realised for the latter to be grounded into one’s sensibilities and mind. \nMany music composers have explored this layam aspect of music\, but the Trinity (Thyagarajaswamy \, Muthuswamy Deekshitar and Shyama Saastrigal) stand out in this. Just like in Raagam\, in Layam also they have many firsts. The basic framework of tala dasha pranas have also been used by them intelligently in their kritis. \nThis presentation will look at that basic framework of layam and how trinity made it shine even better\, both intuitive and explicit. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:O Gaanewali
DESCRIPTION:Entertaining the nobility of India\, her life was different from the other women around her. She had financial independence\, she could choose her patrons and partners\, and most importantly\, she was highly skilled at her art\, her music! \nTawaifs and women performers were given a reputation\, one that made their life difficult and tainted them as prostitutes and sex workers. Unfortunately\, history doesn’t credit them enough for their most valuable contribution to Indian Culture\, their Music! Even though they were known for Thumri\, Dadra\, other semiclassical forms like hori\, jhoola\, chaiti and so on\, they were the first performers to set ghazals to tune and bring them to the performance space as a music genre. This performance will be tracing the evolution of this beautiful genre that gained popularity through the performance of Tawaifs and many other women performers over the years. \nO Gaanewali invites you on a journey through the rich cultural heritage of Indian music\, sharing fascinating stories and anecdotes as it introduces iconic forms like thumri\, dadra\, hori\, chaiti\, and ghazal\, made famous by the legendary Tawaifs and the many talented women who followed in their footsteps \nCreated for lovers for Ghazal\, this format explores a slightly later time period in the lives of these artists\, taking the audience through a nostalgic musical journey. Expect to hear some evergreen Ghazals like Aye Muhobbat Tere Anjaam Pe Rona Aya\, Hum Dekhenge\, Woh Jo Hum Mein Tum Mein Qarar Tha\, Mere Humnafas and more! \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Ravana: Demon or Not?
DESCRIPTION:Demonised as he was after his death\, the reign of King Ravana of Lanka\, and his ancestors\, the powerful Mayuranga\, has long been obscured and shrouded in myth. Their kingdom is believed to have reached beyond the shores of the island\, once\, capturing lands across the seas. A kingdom of such magnitude was never seen again on Lanka. \nIn a bid to shed light on this lost era\, Sunela Jayewardene travelled through Sri Lanka\, and listened to the storytellers and poets\, researched Sri Lanka’s folklore\, sifted through race and religion\, to stitch together a history of a forgotten landscape. \nThe story of the kingdom that Ravana had ruled lay over the island like a fading\, antique map. The edges of the story were frayed and there were lines disconnected by time\, but the landscape it traced\, exists. Ravana’s Lanka: The Landscape of a Lost Kingdom\, written by Sunela Jayewardene is the story she learnt of King Ravana and the kingdom that he lost. \nIn this session\, Sunela will be in conversation with Theatre Practitioner\, Anuradha Venkataraman. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Outsmarting Outbreaks
DESCRIPTION:In our history\, infectious diseases have had and continue to have devastating consequences.  The extension of the human lifespan in the 20th century came from our ability to control the scourges of the past\, smallpox\, tuberculosis\, plague and malaria through safer water and sanitation\, drugs and vaccines. Science transformed society\, but with climate change\, new threats can and will emerge. From data and modelling to emerging technologies\, as the world’s most populous country\, India needs to be prepared for its people and the world. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University’s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Nakshatra
DESCRIPTION:Violinists Trina Basu and Arun Ramamurthy present their debut album\, Nakshatra. This lush and spiritual collaboration bridges traditions and defies genres\, blending South Indian classical music\, Western chamber music\, and jazz improvisation. The album’s title\, a Sanskrit word for constellations and interconnectedness\, encapsulates its expansive sound\, created by two violins in sublime harmony. \nNakshatra is a cinematic work that conveys a sense of two souls conversing across centuries. Rooted in diverse musical traditions\, Trina and Arun reimagine the potential of string chamber music with a unique sound described by The New Yorker as “free-flowing and globe-spanning\,” and by The Guardian as resonating “with the power of an ancient drone\, revivified by a fearless\, contemporary spirit.” This album\, five years in the making\, is a testament to the duo’s fluency in improvisation\, offering a deeply intimate yet grand musical experience. Join us for an evening that promises to be both introspective and expansive\, celebrating the intricate interplay of two violinists. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Confronting Capitalism
DESCRIPTION:What went wrong with capitalism? Ruchir Sharma’s account is not like any you will have heard before. He says progressives are right\, in part\, when they mock modern capitalism as “socialism for the rich.” For a century\, governments have expanded in just about every measurable dimension\, from spending to regulation and the scale of financial rescues when the economy wobbles. The result is expensive state guarantees for everyone—bailouts for the rich\, entitlements for the middle class\, welfare for the poor. \nTaking you back to the 19th century\, Sharma shows how completely the reflexes of government have changed: from hands-off to hands-on\, from doing too little to help anyone in hard times to today trying to prevent anyone suffering any economic pain\, ever. Trading sins of omission and indifference for excesses of spending and meddling\, governments from the United States to Europe and Japan have pumped so much money into their economies that financial markets can no longer invest all that capital efficiently. \nInadvertently\, they have fueled the rise of monopolies\, “zombie” firms\, and billionaires. They have made capitalism less fair and less efficient\, which is slowing economic growth and fueling popular anger. The first step to a cure is a correct diagnose of the problem. Capitalism has been badly distorted by constant government intervention and the relentless spread of a bailout culture. Building an even bigger state will only double down on what ruined capitalism in the first place. \nThe author\, Ruchir Sharma\, will be in conversation with Chairman and Co-founder\, Infosys and Founding Chairman UIDAI (Aadhaar)\, Nandan Nilekani. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n
