SUMMARY:339. An Unequal Citizen?
DESCRIPTION:In 2018\, Rahul Bhatia left his job as an investigative reporter to understand the necessity of the Aadhaar project. But over time\, as he explored its roots\, questions about citizenship and belonging began to grow louder in public life\, culminating in extreme violence in New Delhi. As this happened\, he discovered that India’s technological identity project was linked to a cultural identity project over a century old. These investigations culminated in The Identity Project\, a journey through the slow burn of Indian democracy\, and a record that connects the past and present to offer the first thorough account of how cultural imperatives are guiding the country’s direction. He describes the religious\, societal\, and technological changes that have brought India to a point at which a nationalist mindset that challenges democracy and human rights is spreading fast\, all in an effort to bind the multiethnic\, multilingual\, and multicultural country into a single identity. \nThrough a character-driven narrative informed by on the ground reporting\, he investigates the history of disinformation in India\, and looks at how justice works in the aftermath of riots. What emerges is a timely portrait of a country struggling to define its identity. \nEditor and journalist Prem Panicker will discuss the book with Rahul Bhatia. They will talk about the book’s journey\, the process of reporting\, and about finding the language to report on recent history. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \nContxt \nIn this episode of BIC Talks\, Rahul Bhatia is in conversation with Prem Panicker. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in October 2024. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere\, including Apple Podcasts\, Spotify\, Google Podcasts\, Castbox\, Overcast\, Audible\, and Amazon Music. \n

SUMMARY:Swing\, Reverse-Swing\, Knuckle-Ball
DESCRIPTION:Sanjay Mittal’s presentation begins with an intriguing comparison of how air flows around projectiles in various sports\, from the spinning flight of a soccer ball to the subtle aerodynamics of a golf ball. Drawing on data from experiments conducted at IIT Kanpur’s National Wind Tunnel Facility\, he takes the audience on a journey across the fields and courts of sports like baseball\, cricket\, tennis\, volleyball\, and badminton. \nIn professional badminton\, players prefer duck-feather shuttlecocks for their unique feel and flight characteristics. However\, these shuttlecocks are fragile and costly\, so nylon substitutes are common in recreational play. Prof. Mittal will explore how these synthetic shuttlecocks differ aerodynamically from the traditional feathered ones\, illuminating the role of fluid-structure interactions that make them fly—and feel—so differently in the air. \nCricket fans can look forward to a deep dive into the mysteries of swing and reverse swing. Can a new cricket ball actually reverse swing? Prof. Mittal answers this question by presenting results from wind-tunnel experiments and Large Eddy Simulations. He’ll explain why cricketers shine one side of the ball and how the roughness on one hemisphere affects the ball’s trajectory\, enabling “contrast-swing.” With data from carefully conducted experiments on both new and worn balls\, he’ll show how different surface textures create distinct swing behaviors that bowlers use to baffle batters. \nProf. Mittal then shifts focus to the “knuckleball\,” which has gained attention in cricket\, though he notes it’s a bit of a misnomer. Borrowing insights from baseball\, he proposes a model to capture the peculiar movement of a true knuckleball\, dissecting the optimal seam angle\, speed\, and spin rate at release that make this delivery so elusive for batters. \nTo wrap up\, he will delve into the aerodynamics of a frisbee. With every flick and spin\, the frisbee dances on a layer of air\, a perfect example of how the subtle interaction of shape and flow can lead to graceful\, unpredictable motion. \nProf. Mittal’s lecture will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. Mr. Srinath will offer his comments at the end. \nHigh Tea will be served before the event from 10:30am onwards. \nThis lecture is a part of RRI’s Vignyana Kathegalu\, a series of popular talks on science. \nPresented by: Raman Research Institute\, Bangalore \n \n

SUMMARY:Mandala
DESCRIPTION:Mandala\, is a journey through the themes of Shringara (love)\, Viraha (separation)\, Maya (illusion)\, and Aikya (dissolution). It is a dialogue between the dancer and the singer\, using poetry from saint poets of India\, including Kabir\, Annamacharya\, Kshettraya and Kanakadasa. \nA recurring message of all saint-poets across time\, is the reminder that enjoyment\, pain\, delight\, struggle are all fleeting- this too shall pass. They remind us to savour the world\, be fully present in it\, while simultaneously remembering that nothing is permanent. How does one save oneself from the web of Maya- the entrapment of the illusion? The saints offer an answer to this as well. Bhakti- devotion. \nAnd where is the divine in whom we must have faith? In the mosques? In the temples? East? Or West? The divine is within each of us. \nIt is a poetic journey that traces the path from the outer circle of love to separation\, to disillusionment\, to the ultimate realization that we are one at the core. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Prophet of Modernity
DESCRIPTION:Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya (1861–1962) was arguably the most famous Indian engineer of the twentieth century. And yet he was also much more. To this day\, much in India bears the imprint of Visvesvaraya’s work—not only as civil engineer\, but also as public administrator\, constitutional analyst\, and development thinker. His legacies include innovations in irrigation\, multipurpose dams\, piped water supply systems\, technical institutions\, industrial enterprises\, and transformed cityscapes. He was an early proponent of economic planning and rapid\, large-scale industrialization\, which he believed were essential for national development.  \nYet he has remained an enigmatic figure. Despite his legendary status\, little is known about the man\, his strengths and foibles\, the conflicts and negotiations involved in his career. How do we assess his technical achievements against those of his professional contemporaries? What were the intellectual and professional influences that shaped him? In what ways did his background as an engineer mould his conception of economic development? How were his essentially technocratic views received in his lifetime\, and what do we make of them today? \nThese are some of the key questions that Aparajith Ramnath explores in Engineering a Nation. Based on in-depth archival research\, field visits\, and interviews\, the book provides a vivid portrait of Visvesvaraya’s eight-decade-long public career. Throughout\, it highlights the historical context in which he worked. To explore Visvesvaraya’s life\, the book argues\, is to understand the emergence of the Indian nation itself. \nThe author will be in conversation with Dr. Jahnavi Phalkey\, followed by an audience Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:Akhyāt - Ākhyānā 
DESCRIPTION:Words of inspiration from India’s first female teacher…  \nWritings of unabashed desire from the heart of Tamizh land…  \nQuestions of existentialism asked by Buddhist nuns…  \nProse that interrogates anthropocentrism… \nVerses that subvert gender roles and patriarchy…  \n…and more insight into the female perspective of desire\, denouncement\, faith and activism. Only this time\, through poetry authored by women themselves! \nAkhyāt – Ākhyānā is an experiential exploration of rare multilingual poetry tactfully woven into a Bharatanatyam repertoire performed along with live musicians. This work stems from Divya’s diverse encounters with heart-wrenching poetic expressions of women from across timelines and geographies\, in a quest to unearth narratives ‘by’\, ‘for’ and ‘of’ women. \nCast:\nDance | Choreography | Script – Divya Ravi\nMusic composition | Vocals – Sharan Subramanian\nNattuvangam – DV Prasanna Kumar\nMridangam – Srihari Rangaswamy\nFlute – Vivek Krishna \nSupported by:\n \n
