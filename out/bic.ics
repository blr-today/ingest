SUMMARY:Guardians of the River
DESCRIPTION:Steven Moss\, a British naturalist\, once called the otter “the elusive movie-star”. The apex predator of river and stream ecosystems in India\, the otter is a charismatic and reclusive mammal that has evolved over millennia to adapt brilliantly to its habitat. And yet\, today\, the three species of otters found in India are in a vulnerable spot\, with declining habitat and increasing demand for water placing critical constraints on their continued survival. \nIn this talk\, Gopakumar Menon will make a case for their protection and\, thereby\, the larger case for the preservation of their riparian habitat. \nThe talk will be followed by a panel discussion with conservationist Praneet Goteti and a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Action or Despair: What Does India Need From Her Citizens?
DESCRIPTION:We stand today\, at the pinnacle of accomplishments and depths of despair\, all at once. We applaud achievements in sports\, space science\, medical breakthrough\, foreign investments and high speed trains. We are highly critical of bad roads\, waste mismanagment\, pollution\, poverty\, suppression of freedom\, of human rights violations. \nWe look to precepts from anyone\, and anything to give us a semblance of order. Many of us don’t stop to think about our own role in all that we criticise. \nWell-known activist Brinda Adige will talk about how each of us (no matter of what age and in whatever capacity\, big or small) can contribute towards activating change that will make our city\, our country\, our world a better place for all. She peppers her talk with snippets from her own wide-ranging and courageous experience as an activist. \nThe Vijay Nambisan Trust: \nThe Vijay Nambisan Trust was formed to perpetuate the cause of Humanities in its many spheres. The Vijay Memorial Lecture to be held every year is the first event to be sponsored by the Trust in partnership with the Bangalore International Centre. \nAbout Vijay Nambisan: \nOne of the best poet-writers of his generation\, Vijay Nambisan is known as much for his poetry and prose\, as he is for his reclusiveness. He dropped out of IIT Madras in his fourth year of engineering to pursue his love for the written word. He won the first All India British Council Poetry Prize in 1988\, worked for a number of years in the literary section of The Hindu and published collections of poetry and prose in his inimitable style. He was married to surgeon and novelist\, Kavery Nambisan. \n

SUMMARY:Mela Chiraagaa’n | ਮੇਲਾ ਚਿਰਾਗਾਂ | میلہ چراغاں
DESCRIPTION:Mela Chiraagaa’n… \n…a MELA of Sufi kalaam\, woven with music and narration \n…a MELA that brings Hindus\, Sikhs and Muslims together to celebrate a poet from Punjab’s soil \n…a MELA that dissolves boundaries of gender\, caste\, class\, religion \nThe earthy kalaam of 16th century Sufi faqeer Shah Hussain is an inseparable part of Punjab’s soil\, its consciousness\, its ‘khalqat’\, the people of ‘Sanjha’ Punjab. Weaver\, mystic\, poet\, Shah Hussain kept away from ‘peeri’\, ‘meeri’\, all kinds of high sounding titles\, he lives in our hearts as ‘faqeer nimaana’ (the lowly faqeer). \nMela Chiraaga’an Urs is celebrated every year in remembrance of this poet faqeer Shah Hussain and his beloved disciple\, a Hindu Brahmin boy Madho Lal\, as they lie buried in their twin graves near Lahore. So inextricably connected\, Shah Husain is also remembered as Madho Lal Hussain. 2024 marks Madho lal Hussain’s 436th Urs\, his death anniversary\, a celebration of the final union with the beloved divine ( ‘Urus’ in Arabic is a wedding) \nThis Mela\, a confluence of his poetry\, woven with music and narrative\, is his journey as a Julaaha (weaver)\, a ‘malaamati’\, as Faqeer Nimaana\, the lowly faqeer. It celebrates Punjab’s common cultural landscape\, the common poetry\, the language\, the voice\, which remains one despite the border that separates us. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Kantha: Weaving Sounds of Asia
DESCRIPTION:Music grows and changes at the boundaries – where cultures collide and create something new. This is especially true in Asia\, where culture\, language and food change every 100 kilometers. \nAbhijit looks at the spread of music across Asia (especially South Asia) and how interesting new music is being created today at these points of flux. The music that we’ll be listening to will be featured at Kantha\, a music festival that debuts this year in Bengaluru\, spread across 16 days at Freedom Park. \nKantha is part of the BLR Hubba\, Bengaluru’s own city festival\, being held in it’s second edition this year. This listening session gives attendees a sneak peek into what they can expect to hear\, and delve deeper into some of the stories behind the music. \nBIC’s Listening Room Sessions are an opportunity to come together\, listen to and discover new music\, refine old tastes and share influences\, stories and memories. \n

SUMMARY:Dasamahavidhya
DESCRIPTION:A selected piece from the researched choreographic work\, Dashamahavidya in Sanskrit which depicts the ten forms of the Parashakti according to the tantra. Considering the fact that the number” ten” is an important number of human life\, the history states that the mathematical scenerio of the world was given a full stop before the invention of the digit “zero” by Aryabhatta. On the other hand\, The Dasadishi\, The Dasakarma\, The Dasamandala and The Dasavataram are all related closely to the human life and coincidentally we stay in the mother’s womb for ten months and ten days. \n“Dasamahavidya“ is not only the description of the dhyana mantras of the ten Devis such as  Kamala \,Kali\, Tara\, Vagala\, Bhairabi\, Bubaneswari\, Dhumabati\, Matangi\, Chinnamasta and Shorashi\, but it is the reflection of the ultimate human life\, human emotions (the nine rasas) and the stages through which man goes slowly and gradually towards ultimate completeness. \n\nSet to Dasa-ragamalika and Tala-malika\,\nConcept and choreography – Sri Samrat Dutta\,\nSanskrit research work – Sri Samipeshu Das \, Sri Debopam Das.\nIntermediate slokas creation & narration by – Sri Debopam Das.\nVocal – Sri K G Prasad\nNattuvangam – Smt Mohana Iyer\nMridangam and total music arrangement – Sri Shankar Narayananswami\nFlute – Sri Rupak Mukherjee\nViolin – Sri Natarajan\n\nSupported by \n \n

SUMMARY:The End
DESCRIPTION:90 mins | English & Hindi \nA college romance slowly takes a turn for something complicated and traumatic. \nA young live-in couple begins to realize that maybe love isn’t all that you need\nto build a home with someone. \nDoubt\, deceit\, and the past come to haunt a marriage that is struggling to survive. \nAn anthology of 3 stories about 3 couples\, ‘The End’ uses text\, movement\, music\, and memory to understand what we look for in romance and relationships when the odds are stacked against us\, when love starts making way for loss\, and questions about desire and the need for control start popping up. How does one unlearn societal norms and expectations to build relationships that are authentic\, nurturing\, and filled with love still? \nWe meet these 3 couples near what they think is the end of their (love) stories. \nBut is it\, really\, The End? \nCredits: \nDesign & Direction: Nikhita Singh \nWriters: Nikhita Singh\, Mitali Kalagi\, Sambita De \nCast: Mitali Kalagi\, Rituparna Sanyal\, Kaustav Sinha\, Aditya Kashyap \nMovement Director: Babusha Jain \nMusic: Hashparker (Harsh Choudhary) \nLyrics & Poetry: Madhumoy Satpathy \nAssistant Director: Rituparna Sanyal \nProduction Manager & Photographer: Divyansh Thada \nProduction Assistant: Sambita De \nCostume Design: Simran Jagdale \nSet Design: Nikhita Singh\, Rituparna Sanyal\, Vivek Jadhav \nLight Design: Nikhita Singh\, Rahul Kumar \nPoster Design: Vighnesh Kharadkar\, Debosmita Mazumdar \nSocial Media Design: Tanya Vaghela \nSocial Media Planning & Strategy: Divya Sundrani \nMarketing & Publicity: Dheeraj Dubey \nCreative Director for Visual Promos: Omkar Phatak \nOutreach & Brand Advocacy Partner: Centre for Contemporary Folklore \nSupported by Tamaasha Studio Foundation’s UsPaar Residency. \n  \nThis is a BIC Elsewhere Event. \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur\, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations\, arts\, and culture directly to diverse audiences.

SUMMARY:Akhyāt - Ākhyānā 
DESCRIPTION:Words of inspiration from India’s first female teacher…  \nWritings of unabashed desire from the heart of Tamizh land…  \nQuestions of existentialism asked by Buddhist nuns…  \nProse that interrogates anthropocentrism… \nVerses that subvert gender roles and patriarchy…  \n…and more insight into the female perspective of desire\, denouncement\, faith and activism. Only this time\, through poetry authored by women themselves! \nAkhyāt – Ākhyānā is an experiential exploration of rare multilingual poetry tactfully woven into a Bharatanatyam repertoire performed along with live musicians. This work stems from Divya’s diverse encounters with heart-wrenching poetic expressions of women from across timelines and geographies\, in a quest to unearth narratives ‘by’\, ‘for’ and ‘of’ women. \nCast:\nDance | Choreography | Script – Divya Ravi\nMusic composition | Vocals – Sharan Subramanian\nNattuvangam – DV Prasanna Kumar\nMridangam – Srihari Rangaswamy\nFlute – Vivek Krishna \nSupported by:\n \n
