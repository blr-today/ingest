SUMMARY:MiniSalone
DESCRIPTION:The show puts together a selection of design pieces from local importers of Italian brands\, with the idea of playfully recreate a miniature of Salone del Mobile of Milan. \nThe 2024 Salone del Mobile is back as the star of the design calendar: the leading international event for the design industry will be held from 16th to 21st April\, in its traditional time frame\, at Milan’s Rho Fiera fairgrounds. Set up in 1961\, the trade fair boasts a wide range of furnishing products\, distinguished by their expressive power and their functional\, technological and material innovation\, devised to enhance the domestic scene. Ingenuity\, vision\, innovation\, sustainable excellence and emotion make up the familiar lexicon of the companies and brands that exhibit at the Salone Internazionale del Mobile\, which has now been proved to be increasingly more global\, inclusive and in dialogue with the entire creative and productive furnishing system. Each year\, the trade fair gives shape to its mission as a laboratory of experimentation and cross-pollination\, a place to meet\, to interface and create new business opportunities. It is here that prototypes and innovations in terms of furnishings\, domestic spaces and lifestyles are presented: bedrooms\, living and dining areas\, entrance corridors and service areas\, outdoor spaces with their furniture and cupboards\, upholstereds\, tables and chairs set the scene for a narrative that starts with this room\, exploring how the way we live is changing and\, consequently\, home living and furnishing. \nPresented by: \n  \nThe exhibition is in collaboration with Living Art Interiors\, Simply Sofas and Ventura Gallery \n                 \n  \n

SUMMARY:The New Culture of Design
DESCRIPTION:Design is both a science and poetics of relations to collaboratively imagine and build the world. It is more simply a human practice through which we create tools and protocols that bind us to the territories\, forms of life and resources of a common Earth. Contemporary design culture is increasingly becoming entangled with eco-political and social phenomena on a planetary scale that\, from climate disasters to synthetic intelligence and spatial equality\, are calling upon designers and its systems of production to cultivate new understandings around concepts of inclusivity\, innovation and sustainability. Under the thematic umbrella of the 2024 Italian Design Day – Manufacturing Value – Beatrice Leanza will expound upon her experience as a director of institutions\, large scale events and curator of international initiatives\, and how to shape programs founded on social engagement and place-making invested in the transformational power of design. \nThe Italian Design Day\, an annual initiative championed by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation\, serves as a platform to showcase Italy’s rich heritage of design excellence. By seamlessly integrating functionality and sustainability with unparalleled aesthetics and uncompromising quality\, Italian design continues to redefine industry standards and inspire global innovation. \nMiniSalone: Organised by the Consulate of Italy in Bangalore in collaboration with local importers of Italian furniture\, a selection of Italian design pieces will be on show at the BIC Gallery from 19th to 21th March\, as a teaser for the 2024 edition of Salone del Mobile in Milan\, the world largest fair in design furniture. \nThe public will have the chance to visit the show after the talk. \nPresented by: \n   \n

SUMMARY:The Journey from Fear to Love
DESCRIPTION:In 1893\, Swami Vivekananda travelled to Chicago to attend the Parliament of World Religions. There\, amidst representatives of the various religions of the world\, Vivekananda—who grew up in an affluent Bengali household in Calcutta\, studied to be a lawyer\, only to give it up to become a wandering monk—spoke of Universal Religion—‘a religion which will have no place for persecution or intolerance in its polity\, which will recognize the divinity in every man and woman\, and whose whole scope\, whose whole force\, will be created in aiding humanity to realize its own true divine nature’. Although a devout Hindu\, he had always been someone who felt a deep sense of belonging to the plural heritage of the Indian sub-continent. Through his learnings and travels he sought to galvanize society on the basis of love. \nComprising three insightful essays\, Vivekananda and Our Times situates the Swami in today’s world. Rajni Bakshi’s endeavour—which began a century after the Chicago address\, when the country was reeling from the shock of the Ramjanmabhoomi campaign and the consequent demolition of the Babri Masjid—attempts to seek a space for reflection and shows us\, through Vivekananda’s ideologies\, the need to reconcile with the ‘other’ in a ‘shared quest for freedom from fear’. \nA conversation between the author Rajni Bakshi and Govind Krishnan V will by followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nPresented by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Femme Fatales in Ancient Tales
DESCRIPTION:Are they the bad girls of mythology or just plain misunderstood? \nSeductive\, bold\, trailing in their wake doom and destruction\, these were the early rebels of the epics. In these latest books The Forgotten Wife: The Story of Hidimbi and Bheem by Madahavi Mahadevan\, Jezebel by KR Meera\, and Eden Abandoned: The Story of Lilith by Shinie Antony\, feminism is able to trace its history and origins back to when perhaps women with ambition were dismissed as demonesses. \nThe three authors will discuss legend and lore with poet Mani Rao. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Africa - The Wild Secrets
DESCRIPTION:Pradeep Rao’s fervent dedication to capturing the essence of wildlife through photography has led him on an extraordinary journey spanning numerous countries\, such as Kenya\, Tanzania\, Botswana\, Namibia\, Uganda\, Rwanda\, Ecuador\, Costa Rica\, Bhutan\, the Philippines\, and beyond. In his quest to document mammals and avifauna in their natural habitats\, he has not only immortalized their beauty but also delved into the rich tapestry of history\, culture\, and indigenous tribes across these diverse landscapes. \nThroughout his travels\, Pradeep has discovered that while wildlife may be ubiquitous\, their ability to adapt to varying terrains and climates in pursuit of sustenance is a captivating phenomenon. Witnessing firsthand the anatomical adaptations these creatures have undergone over time\, as well as observing the grand spectacle of animal behavior\, such as the awe-inspiring Great Migration of Wildebeest\, has left an indelible mark on his perspective. \nThe talk will be followed by a moderated conversation with Praneet Goteti and a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Why Does India Lag Behind Its Poorer Neighbours?
DESCRIPTION:A newborn girl can expect to live to eighty in Sri Lanka\, seventy-four in Bangladesh and sixty-nine in India. This is but one of a range of Swati Narayan’s insights from a five-year study across four countries: India\, Bangladesh\, Nepal and Sri Lanka. She found that even poorer neighbours were doing better than India on a range of social indicators: health\, nutrition\, education\, sanitation\, with more women working outside the home. \nNarayan’s intensive\, immersive research shows that India’s leapfrogging neighbours have worked hard to dilute social inequalities. Land reforms\, investments in schools and hospitals\, and socio-political reform movements aimed at diluting caste and gender discrimination – all of these have wrought change over the decades. Excellent networks of primary healthcare clinics\, village schools and household toilets have transformed the lives of citizens in these countries. \nIn economically booming India\, on the other hand\, social ills like sex-selective abortion\, child stunting\, illiteracy and preventable deaths are rampant. Inequalities are stark here—not only between the burgeoning billionaire class and the neglected masses\, but also among the northern states and their southern counterparts. However\, it is in fact the successes in states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala that offer grounds for optimism—India is capable of transformation if governments commit to social welfare investments and bridging social inequities. \nPacked with human stories as well as hard data\, and shot through with empathy and hope\, Swati Narayan’s Unequal is a necessary book for our times. \nSwati will be in conversation with Aakar Patel. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Seeds of Democracy
DESCRIPTION:Cultivating Democracy: Politics and Citizenship in Agrarian India by Mukulika Banerjee is the first study of its kind of the world’s largest democracy that shows how the values of republicanism are essential for successful democratic practice. In 1950\, after independence\, India constituted itself as a sovereign democratic republic. While democracy indicated the character of the vertical representative nature of the relationship between citizens and state\, the term republic outlined the horizontal relationship of fraternity between people and an active engagement by citizens. The discussion of Indian politics in this book thereby attends to both its institutional form and its democratic culture and shows how the project of democracy is incomplete unless it is also accompanied by a continual cultivation of active citizenship of republicanism. \nThis book is an anthropological study of the relationship of formal political democracy and the cultivation of active citizenship in one particular rural setting in India\, studied from 1998 to 2013. It draws on deep ethnographic engagement with the people and social life in two villages\, both during elections and in the time in between them\, to show how these two temporalities connect. The analysis shows how an agrarian village society produces the social imaginaries required for democratic and republican values. The ethnographic microscope on a single paddy growing setting allows us to examine how the various social institutions of kinship\, economy\, and religion are critical sites for the continual civic cultivation of cooperation\, vigilance\, redistribution\, inviolate commitment\, and hope—values that are essential for democracy. \nThe talk by Mukulika Banerjee will be followed by a conversation and a Q&A session with the audience. \nThis event is a part of BIC’s Election series.  \n

SUMMARY:China through Another Prism
DESCRIPTION:Discussions surrounding China and India’s relationship remain urgent and crucial due to their geopolitical significance\, economic interdependence\, and potential for conflict. As two of the world’s most populous nations and emerging global powers\, their interactions shape regional stability and have far-reaching implications for international relations. With ongoing territorial disputes\, trade tensions\, and differing strategic interests\, understanding and managing their relationship is vital for fostering cooperation\, averting conflicts\, and navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing world order. \nExploring themes from his book Beyond Binaries: The World of India and China based on his writings on India\, China and their often-tumultuous relationship\, Shastri Ramachandaran unravels a succinct history of how ties between the two Asian neighbours have evolved over the 15 years from 2008–2022 and the internal and bilateral compulsions that shaped them. The book makes the reader aware about the strategic thinking that went into each move and counter-move by the two nations that are often at odds with each other\, as they are at present. It is an attempt to deepen understanding of the recent history of Sino-Indian relations and\, as the title suggests\, look at India-China relations without putting it in the category of good or bad. \nIn this session\, author Shastri Ramachandran will be in conversation with Manoj Kewalramani taking the listener beyond the binaries in which perceptions of India and China\, their relationship and their role on the world stage is trapped. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nThis is the first event in BIC’s two-part China Series. \n
