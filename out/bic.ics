SUMMARY:Eye of the Cyclone
DESCRIPTION:Overwhelmed? Disoriented? Exhausted? \nIn this reflective session\, Dr. Shyam Bhat draws on his expertise in psychiatry and integrative medicine to unpack the rising sense of disorientation shaped by hyperconnection\, constant noise\, and emotional overload. He explores how these forces fracture our inner clarity\, and offers practical ways to rebuild a steadier sense of purpose. Drawing from both clinical experience and contemplative traditions\, Dr. Bhat charts a path toward reconnecting with our values and rediscovering direction in an increasingly fast-paced world. \nA gentle invitation to pause\, understand what’s unfolding within\, and realign with what truly matters. \nThe talk will be followed by an audience Q&A. \nPresented by: \nNirvikalpa Integrated Therapy Foundation\nFounded by Dr. Shyam Bhat\, the Nirvikalpa Integrated Therapy Foundation blends India’s philosophical and psychological wisdom with modern Western science to create a rigorous\, evidence-based therapeutic model grounded in non-duality and transcendence. The foundation conducts scientific research\, develops therapist-training programs\, and shares integrative mental-health insights with the public. Its work aims to build a culturally rooted\, systematic approach to therapy that strengthens resilience\, deepens connection\, and supports collective well-being. \n \n

SUMMARY:The Realms of Dharma and of the Mahabharata
DESCRIPTION:Dharma is difficult to translate\, and even harder to understand.  \nIn this talk\, scholar Frederick Smith draws on nearly five decades of study to illuminate how the concept of dharma moves\, shifts\, and comes alive across the subcontinent. By tracing regional retellings of the Mahabharata\, he reveals how different communities have interpreted its moral tensions. Turning to modern literature such as U.R. Ananthamurthy’s Samskara\, he connects these ancient debates to contemporary questions of responsibility\, community\, and moral action. With clarity and depth\, Smith examines how ideas of dharma and adharma operate in the Sanskrit Mahabharata and how these ideas ripple outward into contemporary India.  \nA Q&A with the audience will follow\, offering space for reflection and dialogue. \nIn collaboration with: \n  \n

SUMMARY:Born Vulnerable
DESCRIPTION:We inherit more than genes at birth; we inherit environments. \nThis panel turns the spotlight on the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD)\, a growing body of science showing how conditions in the womb and early childhood shape lifelong risk for diabetes\, heart disease\, and other noncommunicable diseases. As India confronts a deepening NCD crisis\, the deeper question this conversation raises is unsettling and urgent: if risk begins before birth\, how do we protect a future we cannot yet see?  \nThe session will examine why early nutrition\, air pollution\, toxic exposures\, and social environments matter as much as adult lifestyle. Dr Kalpana Balakrishnan will discuss how air and toxic exposures affect health beyond the lungs\, while Dr Naveen Ramesh will address how nutrition\, social systems\, and public health responses come into play. The discussion will be moderated by Dr Ashok Vellodi. \nThis panel discussion invites a rethinking of public health itself\, from treatment to prevention\, from adulthood to the very start of life. A Q&A with the audience will close the session. \n

SUMMARY:Becoming Dravidian
DESCRIPTION:How does ideology become actionable?  \nIn the padippakkam (reading rooms) of Tamil Nadu\, ideas spread like wildfire. Pamphlets passed from hand to hand and conversations stretched endlessly. What began as intellectual restlessness soon crystallised into a shared civic consciousness.  \nThe Dravidian Pathway traces how this cultural churning transformed into one of India’s most enduring political movements. Vignesh Rajahmani’s study illuminates the Dravidian movement’s sophisticated synthesis of anti-caste thought\, aspirations for socio-economic mobility\, and an inclusive Dravidian–Tamil identity; an evolution that culminated in the emergence of the electorally formidable DMK. In his account\, ideology is never abstract: it is lived\, negotiated\, and embodied by ordinary people seeking dignity and opportunity. \nIn this discussion\, Rajahmani is joined by Dr. Srikrishna Ayyangar and Dr. Atreyee Majumder\, to examine the strategies of Periyar E.V. Ramasamy\, K. Kamaraj\, C.N. Annadurai\, and M. Karunanidhi\, and consider how their ideas continue to shape Tamil Nadu’s political imagination in an age of rising majoritarianism. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Ordinary Indians\, Extraordinary Democracy
DESCRIPTION:The Preamble of the Indian Constitution begins with “We\, the people of India\,” but do we really know how true that rings?  \nIn popular memory\, the Constitution often appears as the work of a few eminent figures. Assembling India’s Constitution reveals a more layered story; one in which citizens\, communities\, labour groups\, women’s organisations\, and emerging political movements actively influenced constitutional ideas. Across the country\, people petitioned\, campaigned\, debated rights\, and pushed the Assembly to consider questions of citizenship\, minority protections\, gender equality\, land reform\, labour\, and democratic participation. And crucially\, the Assembly listened. \nDrawing on years of archival research\, authors Ornit Shani and Rohit De illuminate how debates unfolding outside the Constituent Assembly; sometimes in distant or overlooked regions\, filtered into its deliberations\, shaping decisions that continue to define India’s democracy. They sought to make constitutional history accessible\, grounded\, and alive\, inviting readers to see the Constitution not as a static text but as a living achievement of millions. \nThe authors will offer a short presentation of the book\, followed by reflections from panelists Arvind Narrain and Arun Thiruvengadam. The event concludes with an audience Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:Play Ball
DESCRIPTION:A triple bill of Indian classical dance; transforming the negotiations of modern life into electrifying movement. \nPlay Ball brings together three sharply etched Bharatanatyam and Kathak pieces that reimagine modern experience through classical form. Premiered in India to wide acclaim at the Natya Kala Conference in 2019\, the production showcases an all-female cast of dancers whose performances move fluidly between playful\, tender\, and powerfully precise. Conceptualised and choreographed by Nina Rajarani MBE\, one of the UK’s leading choreographers\, with original scores composed\, directed\, and sung by Y Yadavan\, the evening is lifted further by live music that draws audiences into each world on stage. \nAcross the three works\, the central question unfolds: what does it take to play ball?\n“Kadala… Is It Love?” follows a relationship strained by wavering fidelity; “Bend It…” transforms the football field into a rhythmic\, high-energy dance of rivalry and camaraderie; and “Quick!” turns the corporate arena into a tightly choreographed contest of ambition and urgency: the piece that won Rajarani the 2006 Place Prize\, Europe’s largest choreographic award. \nRajarani’s fusion feels both deeply familiar and strikingly new. These works capture the pulse of contemporary life through the language of classical dance\, offering an evening where tradition meets the spirited negotiations of the modern world.  \nConcept\, Choreography and Artistic Direction: Nina Rajarani MBE\nMusic Composition and Direction: Y Yadavan\nLight Engineering: B Charles\nSound Engineering: Shanthosh Kannan\nMultimedia Design: Gaurav Singh Nijjer\nMultimedia Operations: Nikhil Bansal \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Love In The Time of Algorithms
DESCRIPTION:Swipe right on a night of laughter\, love and longing. \nCreated by The Self Centre\, Love in the Time of Algorithms is a contemporary theatre production that unpacks today’s wild world of dating and relationships through seven slice-of-life vignettes. From first dates that feel like job interviews to friends surviving the battlefield of bios\, this play brings new-age love to the centre stage. A brutally honest yet tender look at how technology has changed the way we search for connection\, and how even today\, we are all ultimately human. \nWhether you’re single\, taken\, situationship-ing\, healing\, or simply curious\, you’ll leave feeling seen\, entertained\, and maybe even a little hopeful! \nAbout The Self Centre: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Self Centre is a space dedicated to exploring the self and the dilemmas of our times through theatre. It creates and curates work that responds to the pulse of the community\, offering room for reflection\, dialogue\, and transformation.

SUMMARY:Dual Margam 7
DESCRIPTION:Two classical forms. Two systems of expression. \nOdissi emphasizes torso isolations\, its musicality flowing through sculptural stances. Every line curves inward\, contemplative and sensuous. Kuchipudi\, shaped by dance-drama traditions\, brings brisk footwork\, elevation and theatrical precision. Its energy is kinetic\, narrative-driven. \nThis Dual Margam reveals how regional lineage and performance tradition shape technique. Presented together\, these forms show what makes each dance unique in how they occupy space\, interpret rhythm and express meaning.  \nAn evening that showcases the extraordinary breadth of Indian performance traditions on a single stage. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam)\, while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Many Ladders\, Many Futures
DESCRIPTION:A society fails not when it lacks talent\, but when talent has nowhere to go. \nIn this lecture\, Professor Anirudh Krishna invites us to reimagine opportunity not as luck or merit\, but as something societies deliberately construct. Drawing on over a decade of global research across countries and contexts\, this lecture asks an uncomfortable question: how much potential are we wasting when millions operate far below what they’re truly capable of? \nThrough stories of nations that have successfully built strong pathways to success\, we’ll explore the architecture of progress: the schools\, networks\, policies\, and cultural shifts that turn capacity into achievement. This isn’t your average abstract policy talk but rather a conversation to understand the structures that launch young people toward their dreams or leave them stranded. \nWhether you’re an educator\, policymaker\, parent\, or simply someone who cares about untapped potential\, this conversation will reshape how you think about development and the futures we’re building together! \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University’s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Carols in the City
DESCRIPTION:It’s beginning to sound a lot like Christmas! \nTwo of the finest choirs in the country\, The Bangalore Men and Cappella Bangalore\, come together for an evening of festive cheer and choral splendour. Carols in the City offers a traditional Christmas concert with a few gentle twists: beloved classics\, new pieces waiting to become favourites\, and traditions gathered from places far beyond our own December skies. \nRocking jingle bells\, shimmering harmonies\, and the unmistakable sparkle of the season all find their way into this programme\, performed with the richness and precision that have defined both ensembles. Joining them on stage is pianist Rebecca Thomas Colaco. The evening comes alive under the direction of conductor Jonas Olsson. \nA concert that brings the warmth of Christmas to the heart of the city: familiar\, joyful\, and touched with just the right amount of surprise. \nSupported by: \n  Contact \n

SUMMARY:Glowbugs and Glowing Hearts
DESCRIPTION:We can always get by with a little help from our friends! \nBasava\, a young boy\, discovers this for himself when a search for firewood in the forest turns into an unexpected journey shaped by the gentle magic of helping others. \nTo mark the 20th anniversary of Basava and the Dots of Fire\, author Radhika Chadha will do a special reading of her much-beloved tale. First published by Tulika Books in 2005 and now in its seventh reprint\, the book has become a steady favourite among parents\, reviewers and young readers alike. Celebrated for its warm narrative of kindness and friendship\, as well as illustrations that make every page feel like artwork\, it continues to be recommended as a standout picture book two decades after its debut. \nJoin us for a joyful session that revisits a story whose sparks of wonder and empathy glow brightly long after it is read. \nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins\, not with a ticket\, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion\, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet\, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday\, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return\, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books\, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Colours of Meera
DESCRIPTION:A princess who walked away from the palace. A woman who defied family\, society and expectations to sing her devotion. Meera’s voice rings through centuries\, distinct and uncompromising. \nIn a canon dominated by male Bhakti and Sufi mystic poets\, Meera carved her own path. Her songs speak of pure\, love-filled devotion to Krishna\, but they also explore complex yogic ideas that challenge our understanding of spiritual practice. She didn’t just worship: she wandered\, questioned\, and transformed herself into a yogini free from the expectations placed on the women of her time. \nThis musical session explores the many colours of Meera through folk songs from Rajasthan and beyond. Vipul Rikhi will trace how her voice differs from her male contemporaries\, how her femininity shapes her devotion and how her rebellion becomes inseparable from her spirituality.  \nA chance to hear Meera as a radical figure who redefined what devotion could mean. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Why Doesn’t Patriarchy Die?
DESCRIPTION:This conversation will shift your understanding of power\, and of possibility. \nRahila Gupta will discuss how male dominance persists across radically different societies from theocracies to democracies\, dictatorships to socialist states. Her co-authored book Planet Patriarchy\, asks what makes patriarchy so resilient and where feminism is not just surviving but genuinely thriving. \nAt the heart of the conversation is a revelation: a little-known women’s revolution in Rojava\, Northeast Syria. Here\, women are building a bottom-up democracy rooted in multi-ethnic inclusivity and ecological sustainability. It’s a radical reimagining of power that challenges everything we think we know about governance and gender. \nConcluding with an audience Q&A\, this session invites you to rethink power\, resilience\, and the possibilities of feminist futures: one where gender equality isn’t an afterthought but the foundation. \n

SUMMARY:Tales of Longing: Stories of Love and Restraint
DESCRIPTION:Love unfolds in countless shades\, and dance is its most eloquent witness! \nPallavi frames the journey with invocations to Shiva\, the cosmic dancer whose eternal rhythm anchors all experience. Between these moments\, a trio of evocative episodes unfolds: a heroine confiding in her friend about the king she longs for\, a courtesan challenging her lover’s hollow assurances\, and a wife embracing one final night with her husband before he departs for war. Each vignette reveals how love moves through vulnerability\, desire\, frustration\, and devotion. \nThis performance features Raghuram Rajagopalan on vocals\, Vinay Nagarajan on mridangam\, Mathur R. Srinidhi on violin\, and Sahana Sridhar leading the Nattuvangam. With a distinguished live ensemble supporting her\, Pallavi offers an intimate exploration of love’s many textures.  \nAn evening that lingers like a feeling you recognise before you can name. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Kaleidoscope
DESCRIPTION:A tradition stays alive not by preservation alone\, but by the courage to reimagine. \nThis concert pays homage to the Hindustani classical musicians of the 20th century: artists who honoured an ancient lineage while boldly reshaping it for a changing world. As India awakened to independence\, they too evolved with it\, expanding melodic possibilities\, reimagining rhythm\, and infusing contemporary thought into timeless ragas. Legends such as Pt. Dinkar Kaikini\, Pt. Kumar Gandharva\, Vid. Prabha Atre\, Vid. Veena Sahasrabuddhe\, Begum Akhtar\, and Farida Khanum helped forge a modern\, resonant Hindustani idiom whose influence endures today. \nMaahi and Neil revisit this rich inheritance through ragas like Yaman Kalyan\, Bihag\, Multani\, and Bhairavi\, alongside select semi-classical pieces. Both artistes will present vocal works. Maahi will be accompanied by Neil on the Appalachian dulcimer\, while Neil’s performance will feature Aniket on classical electric guitar. Kaushik will provide the rhythmic accompaniment on tabla for both. \nAn evening to honour the musicians who made this music timeless. \nSupported by: \n \n
