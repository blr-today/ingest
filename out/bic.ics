SUMMARY:Maag: A Kashmiri Opera
DESCRIPTION:Maag reimagines Shakespeare’s Macbeth as a dystopian tale set in the ancient settlement of Burzohm\, deeply embedded within the rich cultural tapestry of Kashmir. This opera unfolds in lyrical Kashmiri verse\, seamlessly blending the traditional folk theatre of Bhaand Pather with avant-garde\, post-postmodern performance art. Conceived by the Theatre for Kashmir team\, Maag pushes the boundaries of theatrical expression through daring performance design and innovative storytelling techniques that challenge conventional norms. \nThe opera’s minimalist cast underscores its experimental ethos\, with each performer inhabiting multiple roles\, shifting identities with effortless precision. This approach not only highlights the versatility of the actors but also reflects the opera’s exploration of fractured identities and the fluidity of power. Central to the narrative are three enigmatic shamans—personified as a Cat\, Hyena\, and Raven—whose striking physicality and symbolic costumes evoke ancient archetypes\, each embodying a distinct facet of influence\, manipulation\, and fate. Their presence weaves an otherworldly thread through the story\, amplifying the opera’s dark\, atmospheric undertones while anchoring it in the mythic and the timeless. \nComplementing Maag is a special musical performance\, Dastaan-e-Sama\, presented by the ensemble’s Sufiyana musicians. Dastaan-e-Sama is a captivating journey through the mystical traditions of Kashmir\, blending rich storytelling\, soul-stirring music\, and evocative raqs (sacred dance). Together\, Maag and Dastaan-e-Sama offer a profound exploration of Kashmir’s cultural and spiritual heritage\, inviting audiences into a space where ancient traditions meet contemporary artistic innovation. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Vaadivaasal: The Arena
DESCRIPTION:Chellayipuram—famed for hosting the most exhilarating jallikattu contests of strength between man and bull. This year\, Pichi\, from distant Usilanoor\, is here to face the Kaari bull\, the zamindar’s pride\, both menacing in appearance and undefeated in the bull-taming contest. It’s been two years since his father Ambuli had been gored to death by this same beast. In the billowing dust of the arena\, as Pichi grabs hold of the Kaari’s horn in an attempt to make it bow its head\, watching the contest from his high perch with narrowing eyes is the zamindar. Will his prize animal—and\, by association\, the zamindar himself—be finally humbled by this ordinary young man? Vaadivaasal—The Arena is a story of revenge\, pride and power. \nThis gripping graphic adaptation of the modern literary classic by International Booker Prize-nominated author Perumal Murugan and critically acclaimed graphic novelist Appupen is a story of violence\, death and vengeance… by a Gandhian! \nPerumal Murugan and Appupen will be in conversation with Subodh Sankar\, followed by a Q&A with the audience. A book-signing will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Exploring the Temples of the Deccan
DESCRIPTION:Of all regions of India\, the Deccan has the most diverse architectural traditions\, nowhere better shown than in the variety of stone temples sponsored under a succession of dynasties which ruled peninsular India over some 700 years. To illustrate this unique diversity\, Michell explores religious monuments at lesser-known sites. He begins with Early Chalukya temples overlooking the Tungabhadra river at Alampur\, and ends with the imposing Kakatiya monument at the out of the way village of Palampet\, both in Telangana. In between\, he discusses the Nolamaba period shrines at Nandi and Shravana Belgola\, and those of the Later Chalukyas at Sudi\, Kuruvatti and Lakkundi\, all in Karnataka. He concludes with the little visited Hoysala period shrines at Belavadi\, Mosale and Agraha Bachhahalli. \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A Session with the audience. \nImage credit – Surendra Kumar \nIn collaboration with:\n  \n

SUMMARY:Agents of Happiness
DESCRIPTION:2024 | 90 minutes | Nepali and Dzongkha with English subtitles | Bhutan/Hungary \nCan you measure happiness? The country of Bhutan invented Gross National Happiness to do just that\, and Amber is one of the agents who travels door to door to meet people and see how they feel. However\, he hasn’t gotten around to measuring his own happiness level. Still living with his mother at the age of 40\, he’s nevertheless a hopeless romantic who dreams of finding love. But as one of the Nepali minorities who were deprived of their citizenship\, Amber isn’t the most eligible bachelor. We embark with Amber on his bittersweet journey to encounter Bhutanese from all walks of life. At the end of the road\, we are reminded of the fragility and beauty of our own happiness. No matter where we live. \nFollowing the screening\, Director\, Arun Bhattarai will participate in the discussion with Usha Rao\, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nProducers: Arun Bhattarai\, Máté Vince\, Noémi Veronika Szakonyi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Plate is a Portal
DESCRIPTION:Food holds the power to nourish and sustain us\, to delight and transport us. A good meal can collapse the distance between my past and my present\, ferry me to faraway family\, or bring me closer to my inner child. For writers\, food is an especially potent means to delve into memory\, notions of home\, heritage\, and relationships. \nIn this workshop\, open to writers in all genres\, we will consider the plate as a portal\, reaching through sensorium and memory to explore what food can offer to our practice. We will read prose and poetry about food together and discuss the role that food plays as a cultural signifier\, as a love language in the domestic space\, as a carrier for history\, and more. \nThrough guided generative work\, participants will be invited to consider the food that has nourished them in its fullness – where it comes from\, what historical and personal narratives it holds\, what language it allows them to access\, how it might have changed over time. We’ll read\, write\, and share\, working together to discover the ways in which the theme of food can nourish our writing. \nWhile the workshop will be conducted in English\, and we’ll be reading primarily English-language texts\, writers are welcome to make use of any language(s) they wish to. \n

SUMMARY:From Playground to Podium
DESCRIPTION:Parents play a vital role in the sports journeys of any athlete. Whether it is introducing them to sport\, providing transport support\, managing nutrition\, providing encouragement or financing a career\, they are a vital cog in the wheel. \nParenting is challenging at the best of times. Parenting a child playing\, and aspiring to excel at\, sport is a complex balance that can stretch even the most confident and knowledgeable parent. Yet\, there are few resources for parents on navigating the complexities of career planning and management\, emotional support\, ambiguous progression pathways and opaque governance structures. \nThis event aims give an opportunity to parents who finds themselves searching for insights and experiences that might be valuable in their own journeys and those of their children and to foreground issues and provide perspectives to support parents on the journey of parenting their sports child.  \nThe event will host two panel discussions involving parents who have supported their children’s quests for sports excellence followed by a panel of experts who have advised athletes and parents on their journeys. Each panel discussion will be followed with a brief Q&A session. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:This Is Not a Solo
DESCRIPTION:This is not a solo | 23 min | Vanessa Vieira da Cunha\n(De)construction. The hidden. The exposed. What is. What was. What it no longer is but could be again. Antagonistic relationships create space for a gray place\, the place that inhabits what is not yet one thing or the other. This is not a solo aims to research and deepen issues related to identity\, the exposure of the self\, the importance we attribute to the set of qualities and particularities that we think define us\, the place of confrontation with the vision of the another\, the dizzying sensation of detaching ourselves from what is known and comfortable to reveal inner layers that remain inaccessible to others.\n \nEgo | Echo | 15 min | Indrek Kornel\nA dialogue between self and surroundings\, Ego | Echo explores the interplay of reflection an resonance. Hyper-aware of the textures\, sounds\, tastes\, and rhythms of the here and now\, the performer navigates the constant feedback loop between their body and the world around them. How does the echo of their presence alter the ego of their being? In this improvised journey\, they let each moment reshape them—a push and pull between intention and instinct\, order and chaos\, heaven and hell. It is a movement through the shifting landscapes of self and space\, where the only constant is the present. \nFloating Clouds | 15 min | Abhilash Ningappa\nFloating Clouds is a contemplative performance that examines the complexities of life through the lens of artistic expression. It reflects on the universal challenges\, aspirations\, and fleeting triumphs that shape the human experience The piece combines expressive dance\, spoken word\, and symbolic gestures to create a rich tapestry of movement and meaning. The choreography\, marked by fluidity and grace\, evokes the transient beauty of clouds\, offering a metaphor for the impermanence of life. Spoken text serves as a bridge\, drawing the audience into the narrative and fostering a shared space of reflection. Through its interplay of movement and language. Floating Clouds invites audiences to engage with themes of transformation\, resilience\, and the ephemeral nature of existence.\n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Earthquake
DESCRIPTION:\n54 minutes | English\, Hindi\, Kannada | Suitable for 13+ Years\nTrigger Warnings: Themes of Loneliness \n\n\n\n\nDo you ever feel alone\, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection\, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week\, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends… Yet\, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together\, drifting apart\, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise… \nThis is an adaptation of “Bhūmikampa – Das Erdbeben” which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all\, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships\, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n“Mira and Sameer find themselves surrounded by unspoken words. ‘The Earthquake’ delves into the essence of human relationships—our connections\, routines\, distances\, and all the spaces in between. It asks us what it means to be truly seen or heard. What happens when we finally face the unspoken truths in our interpersonal relationships?”\n\n\n  \nCredits: \nPlaywrights: Marvin Krause and Samragni Dasgupta\nDirector: Shania Mathew \nCast: \nMira: Samragni Dasgupta\nSameer: Naman Roy \nThe Earthquake received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt München Kulturreferat (City of Munich). \nProduced by     \n\nWith Support from \n\n \n\n
