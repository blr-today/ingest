SUMMARY:Echoes of the Moving Body
DESCRIPTION:“O body swayed to music\, O brightening glance\,How can we know the dancer from the dance?” — W.B. Yeats \nOn World Dance Day\, we invite you into this dissolving space between dancer and dance—where form meets feeling\, stillness meets motion\, and art becomes lived experience. \nOur celebration this year unfolds across disciplines\, perspectives\, and rhythms. We begin by pausing—through the lens of photographer Shalini Jain—as she captures movement in stillness and the stories told in a dancer’s fleeting gesture. From this quiet contemplation\, we shift into the immediacy of the body: A Meeting\, a contemporary duet by Gayatri Shetty and Ronita Mukherjee\, explores presence\, dialogue\, and connection through movement. \nAs the evening deepens\, we journey into Rhythms of the Divine a confluence of Indian classical forms—Bharatanatyam\, Kuchipudi\, Mohiniyattam and Kathak—brought to life by Gauri Diwakar\, Sujata Nair Sanjay\, Gururaju\, Minal Prabhu\, and the Mudrika Foundation. Here\, tradition is not static but ever evolving\, and every step becomes a living archive. \nAcross these experiences\, we celebrate dance not only as performance\, but as conversation—between bodies\, between time periods\, between disciplines. Join us as we honor the infinite ways dance speaks\, moves\, and transforms. \nSchedule: \n5pm | Seminar Hall \nStillness in Dance \nA talk on Dance Photography by Shalini Jain \n6 pm | Gallery  \nA Meeting \nA Contemporary Dance Duet by Gayatri Shetty and Ronita Mukherjee \n7 pm |Auditorium \nRhythms of the Divine \nA solo\, duet and group dance performance by Gauri Diwakar\, Sujata Nair Sanjay\, Gururaju\, Minal Prabhu and Mudrika Foundation for Indian Performing Arts \n

SUMMARY:Stillness in Dance
DESCRIPTION:How do you capture something as fluid and ephemeral as dance — a gesture\, a rhythm\, a moment in motion? In this talk\, photographer Shalini Jain shares her approach to photographing performance\, where timing\, intuition\, and emotion come together to create images that resonate beyond the frame. Drawing from her work with dancers and musicians\, she explores how stillness can reflect movement\, and how the camera becomes a quiet partner in the act of performance. Through images and reflection\, Shalini offers a glimpse into the art of seeing rhythm and holding on to what might otherwise be lost in a blink. \nThis will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nThis event is part of our International Dance Day celebrations Echoes of the Moving Body. \n

SUMMARY:A Meeting
DESCRIPTION:A Meeting is embedded in the tumultuous emotional and physical dynamics between its two characters\, highlighting the complexities of human connection and the emotional landscape of desire and disconnection. What connections are able to form if we simply allow and make space and stop? It evokes reflection on the meaning of love\, the nature of relationships and the interplay between connection and solitude. The dancers will meet themselves from different timelines of their life and what happens to the present when the past and future meet. It is a love letter to all that once was and is.\nDancers will draw from their own lives to showcase the push and pull of relationships\, emphasizing moments of intense connection\, followed by periods of emotional and physical dissonance\, reflecting their internal and external conflicts.\nAt a point in this world when our global unity and resistance is so essential\, our daily human connections seem to be falling apart. This piece is a shared yearning and longing for each other\, its one for hope\, loss and desire for freedom. \nChoreography & Concept – Gayatri Shetty\nMovement Collaborator- Ronita Mookerji\nMusic – Riddhiman Dutta & Michael Wall \nThis event is part of our International Dance Day celebrations Echoes of the Moving Body. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Rhythms of the Divine
DESCRIPTION:As a part of World Dance Day celebrations\, this session will celebrate the rich tapestry of Indian classical dance by showcasing a curated blend of solo\, duet\, and group performances\, each representing diverse classical traditions from across the country. \nHari Ho…Gati Meri\nA Solo by Gauri Diwakar \nHari Ho…Gati Meri (let my salvation be in the supreme) is a statement of “You”. It is a search for salvation\, truth and for beauty.\nBased on the poetry of Sayyad Fazlul Hasan popularly known as Maulana Hasrat Mohani\, the work revolves around the eternal resonance of Krishna’s flute.\nIs the melody emerging out of Krishna’s flute a message beckoning to eternal life or the fount of ever increasing knowledge?\nI search you else where\, ignorant me! Waiting\, waiting and letting life go by\, while you reside within the deepest core of me. Let my senses be open to you\, within me.\nI hear the flute\, I see the melody\, I feel the love! \nCredits :\nConcept & Research : Sanjay Nandan\nChoreography :  Aditi Mangaldas\nMusic composition\, vocals & harmonium: Samiullah Khan \nNatya Samanwayam\nA Duet by Sujatha Nair and Gururaju \nOur Indian classical dances bear testimony to the national ethos of Unity in Diversity. Multiple forms\, Single spirit. Here is an attempt to reaffirm this unique trait of our country\, through the coming together of two of our popular classical dance styles; Kuchipudi & Mohiniyattam.  Adhering to the traditions and flavors of individual styles\, blending seamlessly\, an amalgamation of visual beauty and serenity is created. This segment showcases invocatory piece\, a Marathi Nirupan which is abhinaya oriented and a Swathitirunal Kriti\, a Nritta composition\, Tillana. \nAnadi Ananta: The Seamless One\nA Group Performance by Minal Prabhu & Mudrika Foundation for Indian Performing Arts \nThis piece is inspired by Advaita Vedanta\, where Brahman is the ultimate\, singular truth and all other manifestations are mere illusions of that truth. Jagat Chaitanya- the beam of light\, the Parabrahman\, symbolizes the eternal cycle of creation and destruction—without beginning or end. Shiva’s cosmic dance embodies this rhythm of life\, death and rebirth. Through the rhythm created by his movement\, breath\, damaru and the sweat that fell off his dancing body\, he created the Pancha Bhootas\, the five elements – Earth\, Water\, Fire\, Wind\, and Space\, which form the foundation of existence. \nThe manifestation of these elements is the manifestation of Brahman itself. With this production\, we bow to Parabrahman through the ethereal embodiment of the Pancha Bhootas. \nThis event is part of our International Dance Day celebrations Echoes of the Moving Body. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Farooq and I
DESCRIPTION:When the powers that be in Delhi think of Farooq Abdullah\, they think of former R&AW chief A.S. Dulat\, too. The Abdullah–Dulat connection – unlikely\, even dangerous – has shaped Kashmir’s history in ways that few understand. One was India’s top intelligence officer\, the other its most defiant Kashmiri leader. They should have been enemies. Instead\, they built a quiet\, complicated alliance that has outlasted governments\, betrayals and shadow wars. \nFrom the explosion of militancy in the 1990s to the hijacking of Air India’s IC-814 in 1999 and the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019\, their story is inseparable from Kashmir’s most turbulent moments. In this book\, for the first time\, Dulat turns to the man behind the legend. What is Farooq like when the cameras are off? How did 370 alter his place in Kashmir’s future? What divides him from his son and heir\, Omar? And as Kashmir remains contentious\, what cards does he still have to play? \nThe Chief Minister and the Spy is a collection of secrets\, encounters and untold stories – some whispered\, some explosive. With wit\, candour and an insider’s eye\, Dulat reveals ‘Doctor Sahib’ (as Farooq is popularly known) as only he can. Compelling and deeply human\, this book offers a rare glimpse into an unlikely relationship forged in the heat of one of India’s most complex conflicts. \nThe author will be in conversation with Karthik Venkatesh. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Living with Many Loves
DESCRIPTION:All Our Loves: Journeys with Polyamory in India is an eye-opening book on polyamory—the practice of being in love\, with or without sexual intimacies with more than one person simultaneously\, with the consent of all. For anyone who has ever dreamed of love\, sex\, and companionship beyond the limits of traditional monogamy\, this groundbreaking exploration navigates the infinite possibilities that polyamory can offer within the complex realities in India. \nThe discussion on the book will revolve around dispelling myths about the practice and understanding the skills necessary to live a fulfilling and responsible polyamorous life.

SUMMARY:Chaturanga to Chess
DESCRIPTION:From boasting of a lone International Master (IM) in Manuel Aaron in 1962\, India has come a long way in the world of chess\, particularly in the last two-and-half decades of the new Millennium. Today\, India has 85 Grandmasters\, including three women\, 23 Woman Grand Masters\, 140 International Masters and 42 Woman International Masters while the list of FIDE masters is growing by the day. \nIn the top 10 of any category or age group\, Indians figure so prominently that they are second only to the US and China in the men’s and women’s section respectively. The double-gold at the 2024 Olympiad and India’s superb performance in the Candidates added to its growing reputation as a superpower. \nBut if you look from an historic perspective\, our champions of today are merely continuing the legacy of a 5\,000-year-old tradition which can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization when chess (called Chaturanga then) was\, among other things\, used for war stimulation. \nAccording to legend\, Ravan’s wife Mandodari taught him Chaturanga so that he could plan battle strategies. Later\, Chaturanga became Chatrang in Persian and Shatranj in Arabic before travelling to Spain and the rest of the western world. In the modern era\, chess is looked at in different ways. A gymnasium of the mind. A cerebral tug-of-war. \nFor India\, Anand can be the best reference point to start any debate involving chess. In fact\, Indian chess can be neatly divided into Pre-Anand and Post-Anand eras. The Pre-Anand period was nascent with not many players around\, no infrastructure to talk about or any support from the government or the private sector. Indian chess style was one of the many variants of the official chess as recognized by the ruling body FIDE. By the time Anand became India’s first Grandmaster in 1987 and triggered the post-Anand era\, chess was a rapidly growing sport. Let’s look at some figures. Till the start of the new Millennium\, India had just three GMs with Dibyendu Barua (1991) and Pravin Thipsay (1997) following in the footsteps of Anand. The first decade of the new century produced 20 GMs and the next 10 a staggering 44. The present decade has already witnessed 16 GMs to take the tally to 85. \nToday’s panel will discuss this phenomena and the reasons behind it\, the personalities involved\, look at the milestones crossed so far and the ones that are ahead as Indian chess passes through a Golden Era. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n\n

SUMMARY:Void and Verse
DESCRIPTION:Join us at the BIC Library for a Blackout Poetry event where you’ll get to transform pages from your favourite books into original poems. \nBlackout poetry is a unique form of artistic expression that involves taking an existing text\, often a page from a book\, newspaper\, or magazine\, and selectively blacking out or “blacking over” certain words and phrases to create a new\, cohesive\, and visually striking piece of poetry. \nCome with a few pages of text from a book you like (or peruse our selection)\, grab your marker and get started! Participants are given a dedicated period to create their blackout poetry. During this\, they flip through the pages of their choice\, looking for words or phrases that resonate with them\, and use markers to black out the remaining text. \nThe goal is to craft meaningful and visually engaging poems that personally resonates with you followed by a small sharing circle where you’ll get to read out your work! \n

SUMMARY:Manthan
DESCRIPTION:Manthan is a performance that brings together\, for the first time\, two ancient art forms from opposite corners of India—Kaavad storytelling from Rajasthan and Mohiniyattam dance from Kerala. Rooted in the myth of Samudra Manthan\, the churning of the ocean\, it unfolds as a series of seven symbolic ‘manthans’ or churnings\, exploring what it means to be human—psychologically\, emotionally\, philosophically\, and socially. \nThe performance emerges from a long process of research\, exploration\, and experimentation. It weaves original writing\, choreography\, and music into a layered structure of stories within stories\, drawing on Indian mythology alongside imagined and contemporary experiences. Themes of existence\, duality\, and the paradoxes of life surface through metaphor\, movement\, and voice. \nMohiniyattam\, known for its fluidity and depth\, brings grace and quiet power to the performance\, while the rarely-seen Kaavad Katha—supported by over six years of dedicated study—offers a rich narrative tradition that is both visual and oral. The Kaavad box opens and closes like a book\, revealing worlds within\, as the dancer and storyteller move in and out of each other’s rhythms. \nManthan holds space for the interplay of tradition and innovation\, creating a performance that is reflective\, immersive\, and intimate. Rather than offering answers\, it invites the audience into a shared space of reflection—where stories\, images\, and movement gently churn beneath the surface. The performance was first curated by Mayuri Upadhya and commissioned by Serendipity Arts Festival. \nSupported by: \n \n
