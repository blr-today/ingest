SUMMARY:The Earthquake
DESCRIPTION:\n54 minutes | English\, Hindi\, Kannada | Suitable for 13+ Years\nTrigger Warnings: Themes of Loneliness \n\n\n\n\nDo you ever feel alone\, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection\, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week\, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends… Yet\, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together\, drifting apart\, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise… \nThis is an adaptation of “Bhūmikampa – Das Erdbeben” which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all\, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships\, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n“Mira and Sameer find themselves on a bench\, surrounded by unspoken words. ‘The Earthquake’ delves into the essence of human relationships—our connections\, routines\, distances\, and all the spaces in between. It asks us what it means to be truly seen or heard. What happens when we finally face the unspoken truths in our interpersonal relationships?”\n\n\n  \nCredits: \nPlaywrights: Marvin Krause and Samragni Dasgupta\nDirector: Samragni Dasgupta \nCast: \nMira: Yamuna Kali\nSameer: Naman Roy \nThe Earthquake received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt München Kulturreferat (City of Munich). \nProduced by     \n\nWith Support from \n\n \n\n

SUMMARY:Unpacking Economic Freedom in the Constitution
DESCRIPTION:This discussion will explore how the Constitution of India frames the concept of economic freedom. We often think of the constitutional guarantee of freedom in terms of the freedom of speech and expression. This discussion moves beyond this framing to examine the oft-ignored aspect of economic freedom for individuals and organisations. \nThe panellists will discuss the balance between state intervention and individual economic rights\, exploring issues like onerous licensing and compliance requirements for businesses\, property rights and the right to trade occupation\, profession and business. They will also discuss the evolving interpretation of these rights by the judiciary and how constitutional provisions have shaped economic policies and reforms in India over time. \nThis session is the second in the series titled ‘We the People’ to celebrate 75 years of our Constitution. As part of this series\, DAKSH\, in collaboration with BIC\, are organising a series of lectures and panel discussions on various aspects of the Constitution. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Karri-Djarrk-Durrkmirri (We-Together-Work)
DESCRIPTION:Timings: 11 am to 8 pm\nExhibition on show until Sunday\, 13 October \nWalkthroughs with the Artists:\nFriday\, 4 October\, 11:30 am\nSaturday\, 5 October\, 11:30 am \nBábbarra Women’s Centre\, in collaboration with Tharangini Studio\, presents a collection of woodblock textiles\, supported by the Australian Government’s Centre for Australia-India Relations. “Karri-djarrk-durrkmirri\,” meaning “we work together” in the Kuninjku language of West Arnhem Land\, embodies the collaborative spirit of this exhibition\, which blends heritage Indian textile traditions with culturally significant designs by Indigenous Australian women. \nBased in remote Maningrida\, 500 km east of Darwin\, Bábbarra Women’s Centre is dedicated to producing unique screen printed and Lino printed textiles that tell the stories of West Arnhem Land—its people\, traditional foods and spiritual beings like yawkyawk (mermaids). Since its inception in 1987 as a women’s refuge\, the Centre has supported women’s economic and social development. \nTharangini Studio\, a women-owned woodblock printing studio\, shares a commitment to craftsmanship and sustainability. Curators Prithi Pais and Anshu Arora have worked closely with director\, Padmini Govind to interpret the complex design briefs of the Babbarra women and add their expertise in ethically sourced fabrics\, natural dye and repeat patterns. \nKarri-djarrk-durrkmirri is an example of the beautiful artwork that can be created when Australia and India work together. Twenty-one unique textiles made from 77 individual woodblocks will be displayed. The woodblock designs were created by Bábbarra Women’s Centre artists over 20 years and reinterpreted into woodblocks by Tharangini Studio artisans. The fabric was produced under curatorial direction of Prithi Pais and Anshu Arora and Jessica Stalenberg in liaison with Bábbarra Women’s Centre.
