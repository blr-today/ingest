SUMMARY:Kattam Katti
DESCRIPTION:Kattam Katti transports you to Uttarayan\, the world-famous kite festival in Gujurat\, North India\, where millions of people from different cities\, religions\, and social classes come together to fly kites\, marking the transition from winter into spring.  \nTapping into the competitive chaos\, creativity\, and colour of the event\, the show brings to life the excitement of Uttarayan with lyricism\, drama\, and exquisite technique. It illustrates the highs and lows\, loves and losses of the lives that are lived out among the festivities. Kite flying becomes a metaphor for the injustice of unevenly distributed privilege\, in both the corporate world and society more generally.  \nChoreography: Urja Desai Thakore\nSet Design: Simon Daw\nLighting Design: Hector Murray\nDramaturgy: Lou Cope\nCostume Design: Urja Desai Thakore\, Simon Daw\, and Abha Desai Original Creative Producer: Nina Head\nCreative Producer: Lia Prentaki\nProduction Manager: Salvatore Scollo\nStage Manager: Ben Gray\nSound Engineer: Camilo Tirado\nLighting Technician: Chris Burr  \nSpecial thanks to Alap Desai\, Chitra Sundaram\, Michael Hulls\, Parbati Chaudhry\, Madhusoodanan Satchithannandan \, Nina Head\, and Eva Martinez  \nCommissioned by Sadler’s Wells Theatre\, London.

SUMMARY:Inclusive Art
DESCRIPTION:In this interactive and participatory talk by Alice Fox and Dr Hannah Macpherson\, participants will be introduced to the underpinning ideals and philosophies of Inclusive Art\, including the relational components to inclusive work\, the philosophy of coming into being and the crucial emphasis on collaboration and creative listening. \nThe session will then address critics of such participatory practice and show how in art there is more than hope (or sweet dreams!)\, there are proven benefits (for culture\, health and life). \nThe speakers suggest avoiding leaning into overly narrow identity-based work and instead embracing our commonalities—including all our diversity—through Inclusive Arts. This requires nuance. Reflecting on some of the journeys they have taken with the practice of Inclusive Arts in Asia\, they will show how collaborative practices\, first developed alongside neurodiverse people and people with learning disabilities\, have become relevant to collaborating with a wide range of people. \nThe talk will then seek to answer the following provocations using some practical participatory activities: \n\nHow do we travel at the speed of trust using forms of Inclusive Arts practice?\nWhat’s next for Inclusive Art? How might we ‘come into being’ inclusively with each other\, our art materials and the environment?\n\nThis talk will include experiential group activities suitable to all. Come prepared to participate. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:Caste\, Outcaste and Anticaste
DESCRIPTION:\nThis talk will reflect on broad trends in the study of caste including debates and discussions drawing on poststructuralist\, Marxist\, and anthropological approaches which have tended to approach caste as a distinctive form of hierarchy and social distinction. This framing will help to illuminate the challenge of new approaches and intellectual formations\, which center critical caste and Dalit studies\, scholarship on anticaste thought\, and studies of global caste. \nHow does a politics of the present inflect social transformations of caste\, as well as the resistance to its inequities? What are the potentials and the perils to studying caste through global fields of power and comparison? How might we bridge institutional logics and disciplinary constraints in effecting novel forms of critique? \nA Q&A session will follow the talk. \n\n

SUMMARY:Frugal Innovation - India’s Edge
DESCRIPTION:India stands at a critical juncture\, balancing remarkable economic progress with persistent challenges. As the world’s fifth-largest economy\, India boasts impressive growth rates and has lifted millions out of poverty. However\, it still grapples with low per capita income\, inadequate human development\, and a large informal sector. \nThe nation faces resource constraints\, including energy dependence\, land scarcity\, and skilled labour shortages. These limitations pose significant hurdles to improving living standards for over half a billion people while maintaining ecological balance. \nThe key to India’s future lies in “frugal innovation” or “jugaad innovation” – doing more and better with less\, at scale. For decades\, Indian businesses and consumers have excelled in transforming limited resources into affordable solutions across various sectors. However\, much of this innovation has relied on adapting Western technology rather than developing original solutions. \nThis event explores how India can leverage its innate frugal ingenuity to create sustainable\, scalable solutions that address its unique challenges. We will discuss strategies for fostering indigenous technological innovation\, promoting inclusive growth\, and balancing development with environmental preservation. Join us to envision India’s path towards becoming a global leader in frugal innovation and sustainable development. \nA talk by author Jaideep Prabhu will be followed by a conversation with Mekin Maheshwari\, Founder & CEO\, Udhyam Learning Foundation and a Q&A session with the audience. \n  \n

SUMMARY:Dante Beyond Borders
DESCRIPTION:Dante Beyond Borders is an Italian Indian co-production born from the collaboration between Instabili Vaganti and Ahum Trust and inspired by the Divine Comedy of the great Italian Poet Dante Alighieri\, on the occasion of his 700 years death’s anniversary. \nThe performance explores different artistic languages: experimental theatre\, dance\, cinema\, video art and electronic music in order to bring the spectator into the otherworldly journey made by Dante. The sounds of Dante’s ancient Italian language meet the mudras and gestures of  the traditional Bharatanatyam dance\, accompanied by the contemporary electronic soundscapes originally composed by the Oscar winning Italian musician Riccardo Nanni\, around the leading suggestion of the Absence\, an element that permeates Dante’s works. \nThe evocative physical actions of the performer Nicola Pianzola and the dance of Anuradha Venkataraman interact with the videos realised by the artists of the project through a remote collaboration developed during the lockdown. \nThe performance aims to explore the  numerous connections between Dante’s work and Indian culture\, both from an iconographic\, philosophical and theological point of view. \nDirection: Anna Dora Dorno\nDramaturgy: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\nPerformers: Nicola Pianzola\, Anuradha Venkataraman\nChoreography: Anuradha Venkataraman\, Nicola Pianzola\nPerformance in video\, original songs and voice over: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\, Anuradha Venkataraman\nOriginal music and sound design: Riccardo Nanni\nVideo creation: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\, Ashwin Iyer\nSet and Light design: Anna Dora Dorno\nProduction: Istituto Italiano di cultura in Mumbai\, Instabili Vaganti\, Ahum Trust\nSupporters: MIC Ministry of culture / Istituto Italiano di cultura in New Delhi \nIn collaboration with: \n      \n

SUMMARY:Universal Food Security
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a world without hunger and malnutrition. What would it take to achieve a genuinely food-secure world—where every person gets to consume the right quantity and quality of food to live a healthy\, active\, and productive life? \nAchieving and sustaining such a future requires transforming how our food is grown\, managed\, distributed\, and consumed. From production to consumption\, our food systems must be more sustainable\, halting environmental degradation\, and even repairing the damage we have previously done. \nGlenn Denning’s Universal Food Security: How to End Hunger While Protecting the Planet presents a bold\, evidence-based\, practical guide to food systems transformation. He bridges the divisive worlds of science\, policy\, and practice. By synthesizing the most relevant literature\, consulting the world’s foremost experts\, and sharing personal insights gained over four decades\, Denning lays out five priority areas for action and investment. \nBut in Universal Food Security\, Denning goes beyond what needs to change. He goes on to tackle the challenges of implementation. Echoing the words of his mentor\, the late Professor MS Swaminathan\, Denning argues that we need the knowhow and the do-how to transform our food systems.  \nUniversal Food Security calls for a new generation of enlightened practitioner-leaders—acting on their own and with others\, through institutions—to achieve a food-secure world. \nImage Captions:\nThumbnail\, Poster and Header: Rice crops in Cambodia\nInstastory: Maize crops in Malawi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:That’s All Folks!
DESCRIPTION:*This work contains scenes that explore mature themes. Viewer discretion is advised.* \nThe irreverent That’s All Folks!\, premiered at the Equilibrio Festival 2024 and draws inspiration from cartoons. In a minimalist set\, a quartet of international performers—Damiano Ottavio Bigi\, Ching-Ying Chien\, Issue Park\, and Faith Prendergast—explore a work that blends dance\, science\, and myth. Inspired by the concept of the ‘event horizon\,’ it delves into physical vertigo\, the fall\, and being drawn into a space where perspective shifts and everything changes depending on where we look. \nThis project continues the themes of Un Discreto Protagonista\, expanding the conversation on choreographic writing and artistic composition. While the previous work focused on the universe’s origins and astronomical processes\, this piece shifts to humanity’s relationship with the cosmos. \nWorking with a quartet of dancers\, the team explored two distinct paths. The first centers on a “purely physical narrative\,” using complex movement patterns to create a thematic structure that unfolds gradually. This investigation draws on ritual forms connected to founding myths and cosmology\, balancing irrationality with control and chaos with logic to explore interconnected spatial and dimensional relationships. \nThe second path constructs four characters suspended in an undefined space—a non-time and non-place—where they encounter their unconscious and archetypal memories. Inspired by the event horizon concept\, the characters search for a new beginning\, questioning whether our world could have emerged from a previous universe\, in a moment called “the bounce\,” when space and time dissolved into a cloud of probabilities. \nThrough this journey\, they question the nature of time\, motion\, and instability in a place where there is no fixed perspective. Our vulnerabilities and strengths are mixed as we teeter on the edge\, learning more about ourselves. \nCreated by Damiano Ottavio Bigi & Alessandra Paoletti\nPerformers: Damiano Ottavio Bigi\, Ching-Ying Chien\, Issue Park\, Faith Prendergast\nComposition and Sound Design: David Blouin\nMusic: David Blouin\, Colin Stetson / Sarah Neufeld Duo\, Gary ‘Oslide\, Henry Purcell\, Hank Williams\nLighting Design: Lucien Laborderie\nSet and Costumes: In collaboration with Tzela Christopoulou\nSet Construction: Marios Karaolis \nPlease note: Kindly arrive and be seated by 7:15pm. Entry to the auditorium will not be permitted after the performance begins at 7:30pm. \nIn collaboration with: \n           \n

SUMMARY:Solving Avian Mysteries
DESCRIPTION:To find a rare bird is the ultimate dream of ornithologists and birdwatchers. But doing it requires a combination of skills including an understanding of habitats\, animal behaviour and people skills as well as plain old good luck. But the ornithologists\, naturalists and birdwatchers\, who tracked down the most difficult to find birds of the Indian subcontinent\, got lucky because they worked really hard at it. \nIn this session authors Shashank Dalvi and Anita Mani will be in conversation with contributors to the book ‘The Search for India’s Rarest Birds‘\, Atul Jain\, Radhika Raj and Aasheesh Pittie  who will be speaking about the challenges of species discovery and what makes a bird ‘rare’. In addition\, the session will explore conservation issues and solutions to prevent such rare species from going over the brink\, as well as future directions on where the next raft of discoveries could come from. \nIn collaboration with : \n          \n

SUMMARY:Putting the Story Back into History
DESCRIPTION:A little over five hundred years ago\, in a green valley surrounded by tall mountains\, a Timurid prince named Babur was born. Babur’s tumultuous life led him to India\, where he laid the foundations of what would become one of the wealthiest empires in the world. \nBabur’s descendants would reshape the cuisine\, music\, art and landscape of their new home\, creating a vibrant\, syncretic culture of intellectual curiosity and an openness to new influences. Yet\, from its zenith in the seventeenth century\, the empire would decline swiftly\, and end in tragedy three hundred years after it began. \nWho were the men and women who peopled this empire? How did their choices influence the course of history? From Humayun\, the emperor who looked to the stars for guidance\, to Jahangir\, the ever-curious traveller\, to the tragic figure of Shah Alam II\, this session will focus on the triumphs and tragedies of the Timurids\, and why their stories still matter. \nA talk by the author will be followed by a discussion with Meera Iyer\, INTACH and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:Sevens
DESCRIPTION:Sevens is a triple bill of dance pieces\, featuring Nina Rajarani as a performer\, as well as\nfour Bharatanatyam and Kathak dancers and three musicians in ensemble work. Seven\nSnags\, Seven Steps and Seven Sins explore the sacred and sinful significance of the\nnumber seven. \nSeven Snags \nThe choreographic equivalent of an obstacle race\, this is a fast-paced rhythmic ensemble filled with exciting dynamics and laced with challenging cross-rhythms. This is an abstract display of the fun and frolics of youth\, the flirtatious quality of interactions\, the freedom and liberties one takes with choices\, all inspired by the modern-day phenomena of speed dating and dating apps. \n  \nSeven Steps \nThis is a duet by dancer/choreographer Nina Rajarani MBE and vocalist/composer Y Yadavan\, based on ‘saptapadi’\, the most important rite of a Hindu marriage ceremony\, where with each step\, the couple make a promise to each other.  \nAlthough an age-old ritual dating back to Vedic times\, the vows remain relevant for anyone entering a committed relationship.  \nSeven Sins \nThis piece is an abstract exploration of stereotyped concept of rights and wrongs \, what it is like to live under the burden of the idea of sin. The behaviour we call ‘sinful’ is never simply that. Sins are the most profound expression of unmet needs. Representing an unfortunate response to difficulty and distress\, Seven Sins considers that we are not evil at all\, but in fact in all types of very human and difficult pain. \nThe piece evolves to evoke both the claustrophobic feeling of guilt that comes from living a life deemed sinful\, untrue or unacceptable; and the dark places we are driven towards by a capitalistic consumerist society that simultaneously demands and condemns accumulation and wealth. \nBut the journey of the piece is one of acceptance as we learn to listen\, not admonish or punish\, a way to forgiveness.  \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:And\, Towards Happy Alleys
DESCRIPTION:75 mins | Persian\, English | 2023 | India\, Iran \nFascinated by Iran’s film culture and the poetic works of the feminist poet Forough Farrokhzad\, Indian filmmaker Sreemoyee Singh sets out in search of the protagonists of Iranian cinema. Her interactions over six years with filmmakers Jafar Panahi\, Mohammad Shirvani and human rights activist Nasrin Sotudeh\, among others\, depict the precarious situation in which critics of the regime find themselves\, including the constant threat of imprisonment and being banned from practicing their profession. With a keen eye for unusual situations\, she poetically captures the effect of the Islamic Republic’s omnipresent censorship on the daily lives of Iranian women whose uncompromising struggle has put them at the forefront of the protests that are currently rocking the country. \nAnd\, Towards Happy Alleys is a passionate declaration of love for the cinema and poetry of Iran which also provides a frank view of daily life\, and bears witness to a fearless generation raising its voice and implacably demanding its civil liberties. \nInspired by Iranian cinema and the poetry of Forough Farrokhzad\, a young director from India journeys to Tehran to witness how resistance becomes a daily act of survival in Iranian society. Despite stringent censorship of the Islamic Regime\, she collects a series of eloquent and candid interviews with filmmaker Jafar Panahi\, activists and Iranian women. Over six years\, these conversations with the camera capture the simmering anxieties\, fears\, hopes and dreams of a nation on the brink of revolution. \nThe screening will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n
