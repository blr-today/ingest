SUMMARY:'STEMinism' and Feminism
DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to be a feminist? And specifically\, what does it mean to be a feminist in science studies? What does it mean to examine science at multiple levels\, using the twin conceptual tools of feminism: gender and patriarchy? Furthermore\, what does it mean to bring in intersectional perspectives to our understanding of science? Using her work on a) developing the field of Feminist Science Studies in India\, b) archiving the gendered experiences of women in science and c) exploring questions about masculinities in science\, Prof. Gita Chadha will present the possibilities of critically reimagining institutional cultures in and around science. \nThis lecture is part of the Obaid Siddiqi Lectures\, Annual lectures delivered by the Obaid Siddiqi Chair in the History and Culture of Science at the Archives at NCBS. \nImage credit: Thumbnail and Header Art by Megha Ramachandra \nIn collaboration with \n     \n

SUMMARY:India's Paradox
DESCRIPTION:In this talk\, Professor Ashutosh Varshney\, will delve into the paradoxes and complexities of India’s democratic journey. Drawing on his extensive research\, he will explore India’s resilience as the world’s largest democracy and its challenges in maintaining liberal democratic norms. He will examine India’s democratic trajectory\, highlighting the foundational choices made by political elites that have contributed to its stability since independence in 1947\, contrasting India’s vibrant electoral democracy with the recent decline in democratic standards observed since 2014\, marked by the erosion of civil liberties\, minority rights\, and checks on executive power. By comparing India’s experience with other democracies worldwide\, particularly in the developing world\, he will provide a comprehensive analysis using global indices and datasets such as V-Dem\, offering insights into how India’s democratic credentials measure up globally. \nProfessor Varshney will also discuss the critical role of political elites and civil society in sustaining and undermining democratic governance. He will emphasise the importance of elite values and interests in shaping democratic trajectories and offer recommendations for reinforcing democratic norms and institutions in India. Strategies for reversing democratic backsliding\, the significance of free and fair elections\, a robust civil society\, and the role of international support for democracy will be key points of discussion. This talk promises to offer profound insights and provoke thoughtful discussion on the state and future of democracy in India. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Patterns in Bhasha
DESCRIPTION:The book The Politics of Modern Indian Language Literature examines various works of literature\, focusing on prose narrative forms such as novels\, short stories\, memoirs and plays. It deals with works by 25 different writers in 14 languages including those from the religious minorities\, marginalised sections and ethnic groups such as those from Kashmir and Manipur\, and also women writers from across India. The thrust of the book is primarily the politics of the writing and the common concerns that surface in the selected works. Since so many languages are covered\, the works are studied in English language translation and important are primarily the concerns and attitudes of the writers as they are revealed in the translated works. \nThe book tries to look beyond the expressed concerns of each writer at covert significations if any. The discussion is expected to shed light on issues pertaining to Indian language literature after 1947\, since this is the first book on the subject to scrutinize it in this way. \nThe author MK Raghavendra will be in conversation with Chiranjiv Singh\, IAS and N Vidyashankar Jois\, both of whom have been highly active culturally in Bengaluru. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n

SUMMARY:Dhrupad Double Bill
DESCRIPTION:Dhrupad is one of the oldest pristine art forms that textures the Indian musical system. Join us for an evening of Dhrupad\, reimagined by two young and talented Dhrupadiyas. \nMurali Mohan Gowda will introduce the basic concepts and techniques of Dhrupad\, specifically related to Dagarbani and Raga music in general.

SUMMARY:The Making of a Campus
DESCRIPTION:The design of the IIM Bangalore (IIMB) campus has evolved through contributions from multiple architects over time\, yet its adaptable built and open spaces seem to have allowed it to develop into a cohesive and integrated entity. The book The Making of a Campus: IIM Bangalore shares how this campus came into being and how it has been experienced over time. Through its pages\, the book reveals the thought processes\, design philosophies\, and the interplay between architecture and community that have contributed to the campus’s continuing appeal and functionality. \nUsing the book as a starting point\, the session will explore how a shared design philosophy has imbued the campus with a sense of timelessness. This project\, conceived and executed by architects Balkrishna Doshi and Achyut Kanvinde with subsequent additions by Sanjay Mohe & Medappa\, stands as a testament to the enduring design. \nThe session will commence with an introduction by the book’s author\, Kiran Keswani\, followed by insights from Bijoy Ramachandran\, who has produced two documentary films on Doshi. Subsequently\, architects Sanjay Mohe and Medappa will present their contributions to the campus design\, sharing their discoveries\, challenges\, and outcomes. The event will conclude with a dialogue on ‘creative collaboration’ among the speakers and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n             \n

SUMMARY:Layam in Trinity Compositions
DESCRIPTION:“Shruthi Maatha\, Laya Pitah” is a famous saying where Shruthi and Layam are seen as two most important fundamentals of music. Layam is a basic rhythm that flows through any movement\, expressed as Thaalam (beats). There is an implicit Layam and explicit Layam. The former is something that has to be realised for the latter to be grounded into one’s sensibilities and mind. \nMany music composers have explored this layam aspect of music\, but the Trinity (Thyagarajaswamy \, Muthuswamy Deekshitar and Shyama Saastrigal) stand out in this. Just like in Raagam\, in Layam also they have many firsts. The basic framework of tala dasha pranas have also been used by them intelligently in their kritis. \nThis presentation will look at that basic framework of layam and how trinity made it shine even better\, both intuitive and explicit. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:O Gaanewali
DESCRIPTION:Entertaining the nobility of India\, her life was different from the other women around her. She had financial independence\, she could choose her patrons and partners\, and most importantly\, she was highly skilled at her art\, her music! \nTawaifs and women performers were given a reputation\, one that made their life difficult and tainted them as prostitutes and sex workers. Unfortunately\, history doesn’t credit them enough for their most valuable contribution to Indian Culture\, their Music! Even though they were known for Thumri\, Dadra\, other semiclassical forms like hori\, jhoola\, chaiti and so on\, they were the first performers to set ghazals to tune and bring them to the performance space as a music genre. This performance will be tracing the evolution of this beautiful genre that gained popularity through the performance of Tawaifs and many other women performers over the years. \nO Gaanewali invites you on a journey through the rich cultural heritage of Indian music\, sharing fascinating stories and anecdotes as it introduces iconic forms like thumri\, dadra\, hori\, chaiti\, and ghazal\, made famous by the legendary Tawaifs and the many talented women who followed in their footsteps \nCreated for lovers for Ghazal\, this format explores a slightly later time period in the lives of these artists\, taking the audience through a nostalgic musical journey. Expect to hear some evergreen Ghazals like Aye Muhobbat Tere Anjaam Pe Rona Aya\, Hum Dekhenge\, Woh Jo Hum Mein Tum Mein Qarar Tha\, Mere Humnafas and more! \nSupported by: \n \n
