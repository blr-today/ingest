SUMMARY:Wolves of the Deccan
DESCRIPTION:Older than the Himalayas\, the Deccan is the oldest geological formation of the Indian subcontinent. Endemic species\, some found nowhere else on earth\, once inhabited this landscape\, teeming with wildlife. Gently undulating plains of endless grasslands and savannah\, rocky thorn and scrub jungles\, and riverine and riparian ecosystems\, were rich with an amazing biodiversity of flora and fauna. Tigers roamed and Asiatic Cheetah hunted Black Buck in high-speed chases across the plains. From Dung Beetles to Sloth Bears\, from the Great Indian Bustard to Caracals\, from millions of migratory birds arriving in winter\, to wild flora rich with life-giving sustenance\, this was the Deccan. From the unbearable heat of summer\, to the welcome monsoons\, the land was vibrant. From cool winters to a short spring\, culture and nature tell stories of millions of years of evolution.  \nFast forward to today\, and the reality of the effects of unsustainable development. Loss of habitat\, rampant illegal wildlife trade\, roadkill\, conflict with the grassroots level stakeholders\, have all taken a heavy toll. We have lost most of our pristine wilderness and over half of our flora and fauna. \nThis presentation will take the audience through a view of the past\, present and future of the Deccan landscape. It will include the work of the Deccan Conservation Foundation as para ecologists\, preserving\, protecting and conserving the last remaining isolated\, unprotected habitats and wilderness\, with a focus on the Indian Wolf\, the apex predator\, and other associated species. \nImage Credit: All photos by Indrajeet Ghorpade. \nPresented by the Deccan Conservation Foundation. \n \n

SUMMARY:Our Trouble With Normal
DESCRIPTION:As Pride Month rolls in\, the eternal question pops up yet again: “Why can’t they keep it to themselves? Why can’t they just act normal?” So… what does it mean to be normal? And what seems to be the queer community’s “Trouble With Normal”\, as Michael Warner calls it? \nCome join us at the BIC Library for an Open Mic that hopes to unravel notions of normality and assimilation through stories brought by you\, the audience\, in mediums of your choice. Challenge narratives of conformity with your art\, music\, stories or poetry\, and share your own trouble with normal! \nGuidelines: \n\nAll pieces must be in line with the themes of queerness and non-conformity.\nParticipants are requested to keep their pieces under 5 minutes to give all participants ample time to speak.\nPieces should be free from profanities.\nPlease keep in mind that BIC is an open and inclusive platform and pieces that reflect intolerance towards any community will not be accepted.\nBIC reserves the right to reject submissions.\n\nPlease submit your pieces here. \nThis year\, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is — unconforming\, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates\, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society\, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression. Pride\, Insists Upon Itself! \n

SUMMARY:Prabodhan - An Awakening
DESCRIPTION:Prabodhan – an awakening is an intimate offering of dance compositions that reflect and reveal the artist’s inner world. Each piece in this journey is a doorway to deeper presence and transformation—an awakening of the senses\, the spirit\, and the social conscience. \nThe performance opens with Madurapuri Chokkar Kauvuthuvam\, a celebration of Śiva’s splendor. In Rāvaṇa – the dot that moved\, the lens turns to Rāvaṇa—not as a demon\, but as a devotee whose fierce love evokes Śiva’s grace\, uncovering a powerful and unexpected reciprocity. \nIn Ganga\, ecological and personal histories entwine. It becomes a meditation on legacy—on what we inherit and what we pass on. This is an awakening to responsibility and the urgent need for care. \nThe final piece\, Chakra Alarippu\, brings the journey to alignment. It is a dance of balance—between breath and movement\, the self and the cosmos. \nThis is not performance as display\, but a quiet turning toward presence—a call to awaken. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Souza's Modernism
DESCRIPTION:Francis Newton Souza\, one of the most provocative and unflinching voices in modern Indian art\, challenged the conventions of both European and Indian art traditions. In her new book F.N. Souza: The Archetypal Artist\, academic and art critic Janeita Singh offers a deeply interdisciplinary reading of Souza’s life and work\, drawing on Jungian analysis\, mythology\, religion\, and philosophy\, to examine how Souza confronted the collective unconscious through his art. \nIn this session\, she presents the key ideas from her book and then engages in a conversation with art historian Annapurna Garimella to explore how Souza’s expressionism defied colonial and religious authority\, reclaimed the fragmented self\, and questioned the ideological foundations of modernism. Together\, they will reflect on the urgency of rethinking art history from decolonial and non-Western perspectives\, and how Souza’s work\, with its blend of eroticism\, irreverence\, and rage\, continues to challenge dominant narratives of aesthetics\, identity\, and power. \nThe conversation will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:First Movers in ‘Second Life’ Start-Ups
DESCRIPTION:When it comes to climate change and the environment\, they are part of  the problem and part of the solution – Plastics and Lithium-ion. \nWe cannot ignore the role these materials play in today’s world. They have revolutionized many industries even while they have been the cause of negative ecological and social impacts. Mainly because their end-of-life management remains a significant global challenge. Is it possible to bring them into the circular economy in positive and equitable ways? \nThis discussion is with three innovative companies that not just think so\, they also walk the talk. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nPresented by: \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Doddata
DESCRIPTION:Discover the raw\, immersive power of Doddata\, a ritualistic folk theatre tradition from North Karnataka that fuses storytelling\, spiritual invocation\, music\, and movement. Also known as Moodalakatte Bayalata\, Doddata is a performance form rooted in village life\, where the stage is sacred and every gesture resonates with centuries of lived belief. Presented by GK Kala Vedike\, Hubballi and led by Ramesh\, this evening offers an intimate and interactive introduction to a tradition where drama is both prayer and pedagogy. \nThrough live demonstrations and audience engagement\, the session traces Doddata’s transformation from a ritual offering into a full-bodied dramatic experience. You’ll witness the vibrant Ranga Pooje (stage worship)\, learn about the significance of traditional instruments like the chende and maddale\, and explore the layered symbolism of costume\, mudras\, and movement. The audience will be invited to participate through chanting invocations\, mirroring expressive gestures\, and stepping briefly into the performative world of gods\, demons\, kings\, and jesters. The evening culminates in a 20-minute performance of Shalyarajana Saarathya\, a tale from the Mahabharata\, allowing audiences to experience the full emotional and spiritual arc of this powerful tradition. \nDoddata is not just a theatrical form but a repository of memory\, identity\, and pedagogy\, passed on through generations by rural communities. While modernisation poses challenges to its continuity\, programs such as the one being presented\, play a vital role in sustaining and revitalising this precious art form. \nThis is not just a performance\, it’s an invitation to enter a space where art\, ritual\, and community converge. Whether you’re a lover of theatre\, a student of culture\, or simply curious about Karnataka’s rich traditions\, Doddata promises a rare\, resonant encounter with a living legacy. \nThis is the third performance of our series BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka’s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India\, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression. Through demonstrations\, performances\, and academic discussions\, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n       \n

SUMMARY:My Otter Diary
DESCRIPTION:52 minutes | English and Kannada with English subtitles | 2005 | India \nIndia’s smooth-coated otters are captivating animals with distinct characters and intricate social lives. In this documentary\, wildlife filmmaker Sugandhi Gadadhar explores the playful and resilient lives of an otter family residing in one of India’s most rapidly changing waterways. \nThe banks of the River Cauvery are where Sugandhi spent her childhood holidays. The memories of those times and her fleeting glimpses of the mysterious animals dipping below the waterline have fascinated her ever since. \nNow she is back and with the help of Shivu\, a local fisherman\, is following Maya\, a female otter\, and her family in the hope of documenting their family dynamics\, challenges\, and achievements. But the otters are wary of her presence. They have learnt that staying elusive means staying alive. \nShivu grew up along the banks of the river Cauvery. He not only helps Sugandhi navigate the waters but also opens her eyes to the lives of fishermen and the problems they face.\nAs pollution and destructive dynamite fishing threaten the delicate balance of their habitat\, the otters and the fishermen\, whose livelihoods also depend on the river\, are often in conflict. \nNot many people know that otters exist in India. An otter is to a river what a tiger is to a forest. They are the apex predators in the river. Set along the picturesque landscape of the river Cauvery in southern India\, this film captures never-before-filmed otter behaviour while subtly articulating the conflict that is brewing. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers. \nThis screening is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Breaking the Nets
DESCRIPTION:25 minutes (2 films) | Bengali and Tamil with English Subtitles | India | 2024 \nThe films are part of a series Breaking the Nets: An oral history of India’s fisherwomen. At the heart of the fishing industry is the invisible labour of women. Over 12.3 million women in India work in fishing— catching\, farming\, processing\, and selling fish\, mending nets\, and maintaining fishing gear. But their contribution is largely unacknowledged. Fisherwomen have fought to get recognition for their labour and secure their rights. “Breaking the Nets” brings stories from across India that chronicle the discriminations fisherwomen have faced\, the battles they have waged\, and the solutions they have crafted. \nFilm 1: This Jungle is Ours \n12 min | Bengali with English subtitles\nUrmila Sardar saw a tiger drag her husband away while they were fishing in the Sundarbans. Parul Haldar had to abandon building a temple dedicated to the forest deity when her husband was killed by a tiger. Still\, they defy the Forest Department to work in this mangrove forest\, facing the threat of tigers\, crocodiles\, and snakes. Catching fish and crab has been the sole means for women here to earn a living. With the creation of the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve\, the government has restricted people’s access to the forest\, and made women’s jobs difficult. Increased frequency of storms and cyclones caused by climate change has added to their woes. Now\, fisherwomen are demanding customary harvest rights in Sundarban. \nFilm 2: The Sea is our Mother\n13 min | Tamil with English subtitles\nNamma Thayi has been diving in the Gulf of Mannar to pick seaweed since she was seven. She couldn’t miss work even when heavily pregnant. On one such dive\, she delivered her child on an island. Today\, as a frail 80-year-old\, she still goes to the sea to collect seaweed. The women around the islands of Gulf of Mannar have carved a niche for themselves as India’s sole wild seaweed harvesters. For them\, diving in the sea is not an act of recreation or adventure\, but a means to their livelihood. With the creation of the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park\, their places of work have come under legal protection for their rich biodiversity. The National Park is also a ‘no-take’ zone\, denying them their traditional fishing grounds and seaweed beds. Over 5\,000 seaweed collectors have their livelihoods at stake. How do women dependent on protected areas survive in the time of conservation? \nThis project is created by a ‘tiny team’ of three independent journalists Shamsheer Yousaf\, Monica Jha\, and Sriram Vittalamurthy. They did everything from reporting\, writing\, shooting and editing photos and videos\, and producing multimedia stories\, debugging the code and troubleshooting. It was supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers and Lakshmi Murthy\, a seaweed harvester turned leader. \nIn collaboration with: \n     \nThis screening is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Huliyappa – A Retelling
DESCRIPTION:15 minutes | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 | India \nHuliyappa is a short documentary in Kannada by first-time filmmaker\, Sourabha Rao. Shot entirely in the remote hamlets of the Uttara Kannada district\, the film is centred around an ancient custom of worshipping the eponymous tiger deity during Deepavali\, for the protection of people and their livestock from large Carnivora – tigers\, leopards and bears. \nThe film reveals the losses faced by the residents of this thickly forested Western Ghats landscape to themselves and their prized cattle due to incidents with wildlife\, and the surprising tolerance\, forgiveness and compassion that prevail in people despite them. It is an exploration of the mythical\, emotional and rational origins of the remarkable faith. Through conversations with people from various strata of the local society\, including scholars\, farmers and cowherds\, Rao makes a concise and compelling retelling of a culture that has maintained the unlikeliest harmony between humans and wildlife in the region for centuries\, and documents the simple rituals that constitute it. \nRather soberingly\, Huliyappa is also a timely reminder of the dire need to impress such indigenous practices upon a generation increasingly disconnected from its roots\, if the equilibrium with Nature\, so pivotal to the future of humanity\, is to be vouchsafed. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with the team that made the film\, in conversation with Sonu Venugopal. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis screening is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Bound by Soil: A Requiem for the Forgotten
DESCRIPTION:Inspired by ONV Kurup’s evocative Malayalam poem Bhoomikaorru Charmageetham\, a requiem to the Earth\, this production mournfully echoes the planet’s anguish as it witnesses the destruction of its progeny and the desecration of its sacred body. Drawing from ancient myths of forests sacrificed for the march of civilization to the modern plundering of natural resources\, the narrative weaves a searing commentary on humanity’s parasitic progression. It lays bare the devastating impact of ecological imbalance\, exposing how the relentless pursuit of growth comes at the expense of both nature and the lives of marginalized communities that remain intimately bound to it. \nThis performance is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:A Perfect Storm
DESCRIPTION:What happens when a defiant chronicler and an idealist revolutionary converge in the playground that is India’s freedom struggle? Urdu newspaper Pratap\, launched in pre-partition India\, was a torchbearer against the British Raj. The man who publicly defended it against colonial censorship was none other than Jawaharlal Nehru. \nThe pen picked up by freedom fighter Virendra\, the paper’s editor and the founder’s son who once walked shoulder to shoulder with stalwarts like Bhagat Singh was equally fearless despite threats by the imperial government\, Indira Gandhi’s Emergency and a parcel bomb sent to Pratap’s office during terrorism in Punjab. \nVirendra was first arrested in the historic Saunders murder case. He was also in jail with Bhagat Singh the day the legendary revolutionary was hanged\, sharing a rare first-hand witness account. In Independent India\, too footsteps filled Pratap and its editors with dread and terror. \nPratap: A Defiant Newspaper is a timely reminder of the ethos of a struggle\, a template for speaking truth to power at all costs. It is the story of a perfect storm. The book is written by Virendra’s son\, distinguished editor Chander Mohan and journalist granddaughter Jyotsna Mohan. Jyotsna and Azeezullah Baig will be in conversation with Maya Sharma. There will be a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Against the Tide
DESCRIPTION:97 minutes | Koli\, Marathi and Hindi with English subtitles | 2023 | India \nAgainst the Tide follows Bombay fishermen Rakesh and Ganesh\, both belonging to the indigenous Koli community and inheritors of a rich\, ancestral knowledge system—one that reads the sea through the moon and tides.

SUMMARY:The History of Welfare
DESCRIPTION:Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press\, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day\, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment\, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India’s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development\, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of ‘direct benefits’ which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session\, Louise Tillin\, the author of the book\, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair\, NLS.  \n
