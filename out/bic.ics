SUMMARY:Seeds of Insight
DESCRIPTION:By the canons of orthodox social science\, countries like India are not supposed to have an environmental consciousness. They are\, as it were\, “too poor to be green.” \nIn his new book\, Speaking with Nature\, Ramachandra Guha challenges this narrative by revealing a virtually unknown prehistory of the global movement set far outside Europe or America. Long before the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring and well before climate change\, ten remarkable individuals wrote with deep insight about the dangers of environmental abuse from within an Indian context. In strikingly contemporary language\, Rabindranath Tagore\, Radhakamal Mukerjee\, J. C. Kumarappa\, Patrick Geddes\, Albert and Gabrielle Howard\, Mira\, Verrier Elwin\, K. M. Munshi\, and M. Krishnan wrote about the forest and the wild\, soil and water\, urbanisation and industrialisation. Positing the idea of what Guha calls “livelihood environmentalism” in contrast to the “full stomach environmentalism” of the affluent world\, these writers\, activists\, and scientists played a pioneering role in shaping global conversations about humanity’s relationship with nature. \nSpanning more than a century of Indian history\, and decidedly transnational in reference\, this book offers rich resources for considering the threat of climate change today. \nRamachandra Guha’s talk will be followed by a conversation with Ecologist\, Harini Nagendra. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Sound of Streets
DESCRIPTION:Teesta Troupers are a collective of musicians\, rappers and songwriters that came to life in 2022 in a jam room below a garage on the Teesta highway\, set up as a part of the research methodology in the Arts Research project Water Cuts Stone by Veecheet Vigya Dhakal. \nTheir music draws from their experience of growing up along the highway and reflects the hustle\, melancholy and dreams of young people from their hometown. They released their debut album Sound of Streets in April 2024. This performance draws an amorphous portrait of the Teesta highway line\, capturing the rhythm of life and work along the highway. \nLanguage: Nepali | English \nThis event is in collaboration with India Foundation for the Arts (IFA)\, as part of their festival Past Forward: The Pleasure\, Purpose and Practice of Arts Research\, that celebrates the work of over 70 artists in the last 10 years of their Arts Research programme.\n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Magic of Sound
DESCRIPTION:Music is the most delicate and precise way to improve your well-being. Through music\, we can look inside ourselves\, at our desires\, and our true feelings. In today’s fast-paced world\, where we need to act quickly and decisively\, there is often no time for feelings\, for awareness\, and for experiencing our accumulated emotions. ‘The Magic of Sound’ will be your gentle guide into the spiritual world. You will find inspiration\, escape the ordinary\, and fill yourself with beauty. For a deeper immersion\, in addition to the sound component\, a visual sequence corresponding to the mood of the piece will be presented. The action will take place in almost complete darkness\, creating a trusting atmosphere of a warm evening. Having experienced ‘The Magic of Sound’\, you will acquire a new energy shell that will envelop you in its magical warmth and light. \n \nSupported by: \n   \n

SUMMARY:Body and Breath: Our Sacred Spaces
DESCRIPTION:Degula | Shreema Upadhya | 35 mins \nThe human form is considered sacred across civilizations and religions. Scriptures describe its sanctity and godliness; the significance its protection holds. Just as a shrine constructed with symbolism and care houses the deity\, so does the body act as a vessel for our soul. This parallel also manifests itself in the Indian temple\, whose structure appears to mirror the human anatomy\, in both the physical and metaphysical sense. \nWhy then do we abuse this body\, hate it\, neglect it\, and constantly attempt to alter it to fit into an external mold that it was never meant to conform to? We journey thus through the length of our very being to where the worshipped resides\, with an exploration of the body through culture and time to celebrate the beauty of the imperfectly unique over the ideal\, the purpose behind the periphery. \nBreath | Deepali Salil\, Sayani Chakraborty | 45 mins \n“Breath is our maadhyam\, a conduit for our emotional well being and a spiritual gateway. Living in the breath allows us to experience our present and our body completely. It allows healing. \nHave you noticed that emotions and thoughts disturb the rhythm of your breath\, leaving it shallow\, or reluctant at the bottom of an exhale or top of an inhale? When left unchecked\, these thoughts and emotions calcifies into repeated\, reactive responses. Meditating and /or regulating our breath opens our awareness\, breaking the chain reaction of emotional and thought elaboration. We can recognize that our incessant breath is always informing us of our inner world\, while simultaneously providing us with the solutions to disturbances in our emotions\, thoughts\, and physical wellbeing. \nThis incessant breath dances within me and I seek that breath while I dance\, and when I dance there are two dancers\, one me and one Shiva. When Shiva gradually merges into me and two dancers become one. I become a manifestation of his Ananda Tandava\, where everything that moves in this universe is a beautiful dance. \nHe dances\, the world dances\, I dance and we all become one.” \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Musings in Mohiniyattam
DESCRIPTION:Vijayalakshmi will present a unique programme\, comprising items that are both traditional and very innovative and singular. They will exemplify and underline the quintessential spirit and technique of Mohiniyattam and have been specially selected\, to offer a pan-Indian experience of the dance form to the audience. Be it a “traditional’’ pan-Indian piece from the revered Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda\, or a piece inspired by the traditional North Indian chaupai\, or an excerpt from her Indo-American work called Rain\, or from the soundtrack of Beyond Grace\, a documentary feature film about her Guru-mother and her\, by LA based film makers. \nHer diverse repertoire truly reflects her pan-Indian and global perspective towards Mohiniyattam\, besides also highlighting the inherent richness of Mohiniyattam’s vocabulary\, which lends itself with equal ease to both traditional and multicultural/world music. The presentation underlines the dance form’s immense versatility and the diverse multicultural influences that have shaped Vijayalakshmi\, the artist and the person. Besides her own multi-dimensional forms of creative expression and her unique collaborations and inspirations both in India and abroad. \nThe session will conclude with a brief Q&A\, moderated by Masoom Parmar\, who is a Bangalore based artist\, curator and arts manager. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n  \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The End
DESCRIPTION:90 mins | English & Hindi \nA college romance slowly takes a turn for something complicated and traumatic. \nA young live-in couple begins to realize that maybe love isn’t all that you need\nto build a home with someone. \nDoubt\, deceit\, and the past come to haunt a marriage that is struggling to survive. \nAn anthology of 3 stories about 3 couples\, ‘The End’ uses text\, movement\, music\, and memory to understand what we look for in romance and relationships when the odds are stacked against us\, when love starts making way for loss\, and questions about desire and the need for control start popping up. How does one unlearn societal norms and expectations to build relationships that are authentic\, nurturing\, and filled with love still? \nWe meet these 3 couples near what they think is the end of their (love) stories. \nBut is it\, really\, The End? \nCredits: \nDesign & Direction: Nikhita Singh \nWriters: Nikhita Singh\, Mitali Kalagi\, Sambita De \nCast: Mitali Kalagi\, Rituparna Sanyal\, Kaustav Sinha\, Aditya Kashyap \nMovement Director: Babusha Jain \nMusic: Hashparker (Harsh Choudhary) \nLyrics & Poetry: Madhumoy Satpathy \nAssistant Director: Rituparna Sanyal \nProduction Manager & Photographer: Divyansh Thada \nProduction Assistant: Sambita De \nCostume Design: Simran Jagdale \nSet Design: Nikhita Singh\, Rituparna Sanyal\, Vivek Jadhav \nLight Design: Nikhita Singh\, Rahul Kumar \nPoster Design: Vighnesh Kharadkar\, Debosmita Mazumdar \nSocial Media Design: Tanya Vaghela \nSocial Media Planning & Strategy: Divya Sundrani \nMarketing & Publicity: Dheeraj Dubey \nCreative Director for Visual Promos: Omkar Phatak \nOutreach & Brand Advocacy Partner: Centre for Contemporary Folklore \nSupported by Tamaasha Studio Foundation’s UsPaar Residency. \n  \nThis is a BIC Elsewhere Event. \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur\, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations\, arts\, and culture directly to diverse audiences.

SUMMARY:Akhyāt - Ākhyānā 
DESCRIPTION:Words of inspiration from India’s first female teacher…  \nWritings of unabashed desire from the heart of Tamizh land…  \nQuestions of existentialism asked by Buddhist nuns…  \nProse that interrogates anthropocentrism… \nVerses that subvert gender roles and patriarchy…  \n…and more insight into the female perspective of desire\, denouncement\, faith and activism. Only this time\, through poetry authored by women themselves! \nAkhyāt – Ākhyānā is an experiential exploration of rare multilingual poetry tactfully woven into a Bharatanatyam repertoire performed along with live musicians. This work stems from Divya’s diverse encounters with heart-wrenching poetic expressions of women from across timelines and geographies\, in a quest to unearth narratives ‘by’\, ‘for’ and ‘of’ women. \nCast:\nDance | Choreography | Script – Divya Ravi\nMusic composition | Vocals – Sharan Subramanian\nNattuvangam – DV Prasanna Kumar\nMridangam – Srihari Rangaswamy\nFlute – Vivek Krishna \nSupported by:\n \n
