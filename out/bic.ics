SUMMARY:Abhipsaa — A Seeking
DESCRIPTION:Abhipsaa — A Seeking charts a journey of discovery in physical\, emotional\, and spiritual realms. \nIn four choreographic works\, Bihayini Satpathy expands the parameters of the formal and representational norms of the Odissi tradition through both narrative and non-narrative dances – reimagining classical Odissi forms through a personalised interpretation. \nCommissioned by Duke University and the Baryshnikov Arts Center\, Abhipsaa — A Seeking\, takes the audience on a profoundly personal journey. In collaboration with musicians\, composers\, lighting and theatrical designers\, Satpathy’s performance is an otherworldly and transformative experience. A selection of the piece was presented virtually by the Baryshnikov Arts Center with introduction by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Mark Morris in February 2021 and the full piece had its world premiere performances at Duke University in December 2021. \nThis work was made possible with additional funding from the New England Foundation for the Arts’ National Dance Project\, with lead funding from the Doris Duke Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. \n

SUMMARY:Kattam Katti
DESCRIPTION:Kattam Katti transports you to Uttarayan\, the world-famous kite festival in Gujurat\, North India\, where millions of people from different cities\, religions\, and social classes come together to fly kites\, marking the transition from winter into spring.  \nTapping into the competitive chaos\, creativity\, and colour of the event\, the show brings to life the excitement of Uttarayan with lyricism\, drama\, and exquisite technique.

SUMMARY:Dante Beyond Borders
DESCRIPTION:Dante Beyond Borders is an Italian Indian co-production born from the collaboration between Instabili Vaganti and Ahum Trust and inspired by the Divine Comedy of the great Italian Poet Dante Alighieri\, on the occasion of his 700 years death’s anniversary. \nThe performance explores different artistic languages: experimental theatre\, dance\, cinema\, video art and electronic music in order to bring the spectator into the otherworldly journey made by Dante. The sounds of Dante’s ancient Italian language meet the mudras and gestures of  the traditional Bharatanatyam dance\, accompanied by the contemporary electronic soundscapes originally composed by the Oscar winning Italian musician Riccardo Nanni\, around the leading suggestion of the Absence\, an element that permeates Dante’s works. \nThe evocative physical actions of the performer Nicola Pianzola and the dance of Anuradha Venkataraman interact with the videos realised by the artists of the project through a remote collaboration developed during the lockdown. \nThe performance aims to explore the  numerous connections between Dante’s work and Indian culture\, both from an iconographic\, philosophical and theological point of view. \nDirection: Anna Dora Dorno\nDramaturgy: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\nPerformers: Nicola Pianzola\, Anuradha Venkataraman\nChoreography: Anuradha Venkataraman\, Nicola Pianzola\nPerformance in video\, original songs and voice over: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\, Anuradha Venkataraman\nOriginal music and sound design: Riccardo Nanni\nVideo creation: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\, Ashwin Iyer\nSet and Light design: Anna Dora Dorno\nProduction: Istituto Italiano di cultura in Mumbai\, Instabili Vaganti\, Ahum Trust\nSupporters: MIC Ministry of culture / Istituto Italiano di cultura in New Delhi \nIn collaboration with: \n      \n

SUMMARY:Universal Food Security
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a world without hunger and malnutrition. What would it take to achieve a genuinely food-secure world—where every person gets to consume the right quantity and quality of food to live a healthy\, active\, and productive life? \nAchieving and sustaining such a future requires transforming how our food is grown\, managed\, distributed\, and consumed. From production to consumption\, our food systems must be more sustainable\, halting environmental degradation\, and even repairing the damage we have previously done. \nGlenn Denning’s Universal Food Security: How to End Hunger While Protecting the Planet presents a bold\, evidence-based\, practical guide to food systems transformation. He bridges the divisive worlds of science\, policy\, and practice. By synthesizing the most relevant literature\, consulting the world’s foremost experts\, and sharing personal insights gained over four decades\, Denning lays out five priority areas for action and investment. \nBut in Universal Food Security\, Denning goes beyond what needs to change. He goes on to tackle the challenges of implementation. Echoing the words of his mentor\, the late Professor MS Swaminathan\, Denning argues that we need the knowhow and the do-how to transform our food systems.  \nUniversal Food Security calls for a new generation of enlightened practitioner-leaders—acting on their own and with others\, through institutions—to achieve a food-secure world. \nImage Captions:\nThumbnail\, Poster and Header: Rice crops in Cambodia\nInstastory: Maize crops in Malawi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Our Eternal Musical Tale
DESCRIPTION:\nAny musical piece has the power to teleport us to a certain moment or phase from our lifetimes. From being ecstatic to being in despair\, from being confused to being determined\, these musical pieces have the ability to take us through all those moments and phases from our lives instantly. \nThrough this concert\, each person in the audience revisits the countless emotions they once experienced in their lifetimes through the life story of the fictional character named ‘Rachanachar’.

The inter-reflective storyline lets us step inside the shoes of Rachanachar\, making us the hero of this eternal musical tale. \nSupported by: \n\n\n
