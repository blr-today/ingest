SUMMARY:A (Pandemic) World in Syllables
DESCRIPTION:In March 2020\, when the world went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus\, poets and friends Marilyn Hacker and Karthika Nair—living mere miles from each other\, but separated by circumstance\, and spurred by this strange time—began a correspondence in verse. \n‘Renga’\, an ancient Japanese form of collaborative poetry\, is comprised of alternating ‘Tanka’\, beginning with the themes of ‘Toki’ and ‘Toza’: this season\, this session. Here\, from the “plague spring”\, through a year in which seasons are marked by the waxing and waning of the virus\, Hacker and Nair’s Renga charts the “differents and sames” of a now-shared experience. \nTheir poems witness a time of suspension in which some things\, somehow\, press on relentlessly\, in which solidarity persists—even thrives—in the face of a strange new kind of isolation. Between “ten thousand\, yes\, minutes of Bones”\, there’s cancer and chemotherapy and the aches of an ageing body. There is grief for the loss of friends nearby and concern for loved ones in the United States\, Lebanon\, and India. And there is a deep sense of shared humanity\, where we all are “mere atoms of water\, each captained by protons of hydrogen\, hurtling earthward.” \nAt turns poignant and playful\, the seasons and sessions of A Different Distance display the compassionate\, collective wisdom of two women witnessing a singular moment in history. \nKarthika Nair will be in conversation with Prem Panicker. An audience Q&A session will follow. \nPresented by:\n \n

SUMMARY:How We Used to Love
DESCRIPTION:Being immune to the charms of poetry is a crime that is its own punishment\, the Sanskritic tradition tells us. Join us as we discover the allure of Sanskrit and Prakrit love poetry and the travails of translating doe-eyes and elephant-thighs into English with Anusha Rao and Suhas Mahesh\, co-translators of the verse anthology\, How to Love in Sanskrit (HarperCollins 2024). \nHow to Love in Sanskrit is a poetic exploration of the maze of modern dating: flirting\, daydreaming\, yearning\, and breaking up\, through the eyes of Kalidasa\, Bana\, Vidya\, and many other\, often anonymous gifted poets. \nModerated by Radhika Chadha\, the translators will discuss their inspiration for the book\, their approach to translation\, misconceptions about Sanskrit poetry\, and the challenges of translating pre-modern poetry\, drawing from both classic and forgotten texts to paint a picture of what love feels like in Sanskrit. The session will conclude with a reading of their favourite verses from the book. \n

SUMMARY:The Journey of the Veena
DESCRIPTION:Ancient Sanskrit literature mentions the veena as the instrument used to accompany vedic chants\, very much like the organ that was used in the Roman catholic church for the Gregorian chants. The earliest instruments used grass reeds and animal guts as strings for plucking and the joke is that the musicians still use “Grass”. As music developed from folk to classical\, desi and Marg Sangeeth\, as described in ancient texts like Natya Shastra of  Bharata Muni of the 3rd Century AD\, and later Sarangadeva of the 11th Century\, the sophistication of playing techniques has advanced. \nIn today’s musical presentation \, the audience will witness the use of hybrid electronic veenas as a part of this sophistication and progress\, without watering down the gravity and authenticity of the musical form as described in voluminous texts on Indian classical music. \nArtists: \nShanthi Rao and Neeraja Krishnamurthy :Veena\nK.N.Uma Maheshwari :Keyboard\nN.Vasudeva : Mridangam\nSubba Rao : Ghatam \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Wild Fictions
DESCRIPTION:Join us for an engaging conversation as Amitav Ghosh discusses Wild Fictions\, a collection of his writings from the past twenty-five years\, with Julia Wheeler. This expansive work explores the themes that have defined Ghosh’s literary journey: literature and language\, climate change and the environment\, human lives\, travel\, and discoveries. \nThrough topics ranging from the commodification of the clove to the rich diversity of Bengal’s mangrove forests and the radical fluidity of multilingualism\, Wild Fictions offers a critique of imperial violence and the fictions we weave to navigate history. It is a call to sensitivity\, empathy\, and the urgent need to repair our relationship with volatile landscapes. \nWith his unique combination of moral passion\, intellectual curiosity\, and literary elegance\, Amitav Ghosh invites us to see the world anew in this thought-provoking discussion. The session will be followed by a book signing with the author. \nIn collaboration with: \n     \n

SUMMARY:The Making of Modern Karnataka
DESCRIPTION:Karnataka is one of India’s most diverse states\, as rich in literary and cultural traditions as it is in democratic struggles and political churns. The twentieth century witnessed the birth of a modern Kannada renaissance\, accompanied by the emergence of a powerful social conscience. One young man’s desire to explore this vibrant historical backyard\, born out of a feeling of being linguistically unmoored\, compounded by worries over an increasingly opaque political direction\, leads to an ambitious—no\, audacious—attempt to unpack the region’s social and cultural histories. \nRama Bhima Soma is an enterprise of translation and rediscovery\, packed with stories and conversations. The life and times of legends like Kuvempu and Shivaram Karanth; the fall of Socialism and the rise of the Hindu Right; the intellectual ruminations of U.R. Ananthamurthy\, D.R. Nagaraj and M.M. Kalburgi; the wildly popular television serials of T.N. Seetharam and the community-centred one-woman theatre shows of Du Saraswathi; a brief history of Naxalism in Karnataka and glimpses of other complicated legacies of the 1970s’ Left—the book explores a dizzyingly wide sweep of Karnataka’s contemporary history\, seeking\, above all\, to forge new connections and begin fresh conversations. \nMarshalling a diverse range of literary and scholarly resources\, framed through biographical sketches and immersive reportage\, this session will reanimate some pivotal moments in the making of modern Karnataka. \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Out of the Middling Middle
DESCRIPTION:Midlife is a phase when we find ourselves pulled in multiple directions—across work\, home\, health\, friendships\, and hobbies. \nIn this session\, Ravi Venkatesan delves into themes from Deepak Jayaraman’s recent book\, Play to Potential. The book offers a nuanced exploration of how to unlock human potential—not just professionally but holistically—by embracing life’s highs and lows. Drawing from his acclaimed Play to Potential podcast and his experiences as a coach\, Deepak introduces the FLAVOUR framework\, a practical guide to navigating the intricate interplay of family\, aspirations\, values\, and relationships. \nDeepak emphasises that life is a team sport\, with family serving as an essential support system. He argues that personal growth and achievement are deeply intertwined with our family contexts\, a perspective often overlooked in self-help literature\, particularly in cultures where family plays a central role. \nA key insight of the book is the recognition that life unfolds in seasons\, shaped by transitions—some intentional\, others unexpected. Using real-life examples and case studies\, Deepak illustrates how navigating these transitions thoughtfully is vital to realising our potential. \nThis discussion will resonate with anyone in their 30s to 60s\, offering valuable strategies to lead a multi-dimensional\, purposeful life. \n

SUMMARY:Dido and Aeneas
DESCRIPTION:Dido and Aeneas in Bangalore is a unique collaboration project\, bringing together some of the finest musicians from India and Sweden\, in a performance of one of the most beloved chamber operas from the Baroque-period. Experience the passionate drama through stirring instrumental music\, dance\, arias and choirs – a must-see-hear in Bangalore in 2025! \nDido and Aeneas is based on Book IV of Virgil’s epic The Aeneid. It is one of the earliest known English operas\, and one of the most important and often performed operas written in the Baroque period. It is also Henry Purcell’s only true opera; that is\, his only all-sung dramatic work. \nWhat is most remarkable for such an important work in the opera repertoire\, is that so little about it is known. A copy of a libretto from the 1700’s exists (possibly from the first performance)\, so we know it originally was composed as a Prologue and Opera. However\, the music for the Prologue\, the end of the act II Grove scene\, and several dances have been lost\, and indeed no score exists in Purcell’s handwriting. \nMoreover\, the dates of composition and the first performance are uncertain. It is known\, through references in letters\, that it was performed at a girls’ school in Chelsea\, London\, some time before the end of 1689. However\, some scholars argue that the opera was composed and performed for the Royal Court of either James II or Charles II with a date as early as 1684\, and argue that the reference in the Prologue to the joy of a marriage between two monarchs is an allegorical one. \nWhatever history of the opera is waiting to be uncovered\, what we do know\, and perhaps most important of all\, is that Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas is a deeply moving and unforgettable opera. \nDido\, Queen of Carthage – Maria Forsström\, mezzo-soprano\nAeneas\, Trojan hero – Rahul Bharadwaj\, baritone\nBelinda\, Dido’s confidante and handmaiden – Tanisha Herbert Rozario\, soprano\nSecond Lady – Rachel Mathew\, soprano\nSorceress – Sangita Santosham\, mezzo-soprano\n1st Witch – Rebekah Alexander\, soprano\n2nd Witch – Ketki Herlekar\, soprano\nA Sailor – Benson Chacko\, tenor\nA Spirit – Nora Alexy\, alto \nViolin – Carol George & Arun Rozario\nViola – Maria Winiarski\nCello – Kristina Winiarski\nBass – Jasiel Peter\nHarpsichord – Rebecca Thomas Colaco\nPercussion – Akshay Nagmule\nGuitar – Ryal Sequiera\nConductor – Sofia Winiarski \nCappella Bangalore\nThe Bangalore Men \nConductor – Jonas Olsson \nDancers from The Lewis Foundation of Classical Ballet\nChoreographer: Iryna Hryshukova\nDancers: Iryna Hryshukova\, Elina Wisung\, Ramya Manikam\, Tanvi Agarwal \nIn collaboration with Legato School of Music and The Lewis Foundation for Classical Ballet \n \n

SUMMARY:Nature's Wild Child
DESCRIPTION:India has a unique relationship with the mango. It is all over our cultural life and festivals. Our emotional life and our social existence. Our markets and our countryside. It is the only fruit that is a festival unto itself. Each year\, cities organize their own mango festivals that are extremely popular events. No other fruit seems to have a comparable role anywhere else. The mango seems intimately familiar to almost all Indians\, nay\, all residents of South Asia. Yet we are unaware of the wider role of the mango fruit\, leaves\, flowers\, trees\, orchards and groves in almost every facet of our lives through our known and unknown history. In politics\, economics\, land ownership\, infrastructure\, ecological (and psychological) health\, propaganda\, diplomacy\, ecology\, festivities\, funerals\, weddings\, seduction\, poetry\, the arts\, architecture… \nDrawing from the recently published bestseller Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango\, this discussion will join the ubiquitous excitement around mangoes to look towards avenues untrodden\, histories unconsidered\, festivals abandoned. The event will take place close to the time that marked India’s myriad spring festivals\, the symbol of which was the mango flower. The known mango is a bridge to a lot about us that is either unknown or goes unacknowledged. \nThe author\, Sopan Joshi will be in conversation with Venu Madhav Govindu which will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Aradhana Saraswati
DESCRIPTION:The concert pays homage to the Goddess Saraswati\, revered through the ages as the embodiment of the four essentials of a discerning human life: Speech (Vaani)\, the foundation of communication and expression; Music (Sangeet)\, the universal language of harmony and emotion; Wisdom (Buddhi)\, the guiding light of understanding and insight; and Discrimination (Vivek)\, the power to discern and choose wisely. \nThrough an enchanting journey of timeless raags and original compositions\, master musicians delve into these eternal qualities\, reflecting the grace and profundity that the Goddess represents. This celebration is not just a tribute to Saraswati but a call to connect with the divine essence of creativity\, intellect\, and balance within us all. \nSupoorted by: \n \n
