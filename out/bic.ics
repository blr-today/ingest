SUMMARY:Reaching for the Stars
DESCRIPTION:What does it take to dream beyond your time—and make those dreams real? \nVikram Sarabhai\, founder of India’s space programme\, imagined communication satellites that would educate people when even a modest rocket launch seemed audacious. He envisioned agricultural complexes powered by atomic energy\, sea water turned drinkable\, and a modern India fuelled by science and creativity. But Sarabhai was more than a scientist—he co-founded the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad\, the National Institute of Design\, the dance academy Darpana\, and India’s first textile research cooperative\, ATIRA. He also ran a thriving pharmaceutical company and launched India’s first market research organisation\, ORG. \nAs India navigates its twenty-first century aspirations\, this session revisits the humane\, imaginative\, yet pragmatic vision of a man who built enduring institutions. Drawing from Vikram Sarabhai: A Life\, author Amrita Shah offers an intimate portrait of a multifaceted genius whose legacy continues to shape India’s present and future. After her talk\, she will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey\, exploring the many lives and lasting vision of this extraordinary builder of modern India. \nThe conversation will conclude with an audience Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:KABIR: A Dance Production
DESCRIPTION:How do centuries-old verses find new life in rhythm and movement? \nKABIR is a Bharatanatyam production that brings the timeless poetry of Sant Kabir into conversation with dance. What makes this work unique is the seamless weaving of Kabir’s Hindi verses into the expressive framework of Bharatanatyam\, guided by the musical brilliance of Vidwan O. S. Arun. His evocative vocals create a living bridge between word and movement\, allowing the spiritual depth of Kabir’s poetry to bloom on stage. \nConceived and choreographed by Varsha Akhouri\, alumna and former faculty of the Kalakshetra Foundation\, the production embodies both tradition and innovation. With her students carrying forward the performance\, the piece becomes not just a retelling of Kabir’s verses but a passing on of artistic legacy. \nKabir’s words question dogma\, transcend boundaries\, and call us to simplicity\, love\, and self-realisation. In this production\, poetry and dance converge to reveal their continued resonance with our fragmented world. \nA performance for the divine within and without. \nCredits:\nMusic and Vocals: O S Arun\nConcept and Choreography: Varsha Akhouri\nTabla: Martin\nMridangam: Shivaprasad\nSitar: Kishore\nFlute: Hariprasad\nSound engineer: Rakesh\nJathi: Sheejith Krishna\nLights: Venkatesh Krishna \nDancers:\nAsika Sajeevan\nAarathi S Nair\nDevika AC\nJisma K.K\nRoopesh PP\nShobhit Shivhare\nSreelakshmi EB\nSreeshna KM\nSreerejini NS \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Gandhi
DESCRIPTION:Can dance translate the restlessness of a conscience\, the weight of compassion? \nWith Gandhi\, choreographer C P Satyajit reimagines the Mahatma’s life and philosophy through the timeless language of Bharatanatyam. This is not a chronological retelling\, but a meditation on his ideals: his restless pursuit of truth\, his unwavering sense of justice\, his profound connection with people. \nThrough delicate abhinaya and layered rhythmic improvisations\, the production traces Gandhi’s journey as both a leader and a seeker. Informed by the research of Dr. V R Devika\, whose PhD explored Gandhi’s communication strategies\, the work captures how his ideals might continue to move us\, literally and metaphorically\, today.\n\nIn this unique performance\, every gesture is a reminder that truth and compassion remain unfinished tasks. \nCredits:\nConcept & Choreography: C P Satyajit \nDancers:\nKeerthana Ganesan\nDevikha S\nHemavathy Kalaiarasan\nParvathi Parameswar\nArchana Sivasubramanian\nAnjannaa Ashok \nMusicians\nM S Sukhi: Rhythm\nMonali Bala: Voice\nManonmani T: Sarangi \nOriginal Lighting Design: Martin Jose\nOperated by: Muthukumar R \nThe production is created by Bharata Kalanjali with the support of the Kaladham Trust and Sarvodaya International\, Karnataka. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n  \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Adventures in Friendship
DESCRIPTION:Step into a world where stories come alive! \nThis playful\, imaginative psychodrama workshop invites children (ages 8–12) and their parents into a delightful exploration of friendship through three beloved tales—The Musicians of Bremen\, Krishna and Sudama\, and The Monkey and the Crocodile. Together\, we’ll jump into the roles of these memorable characters\, improvising new meanings and alternative endings\, while joyfully navigating friendship’s adventures\, challenges\, and deeper meanings. \nExpect laughter\, noise\, creativity\, and quiet reflections as we uncover essential lessons about friendship. Two unforgettable hours spent deepening bonds through story\, play\, and shared discovery. \nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins\, not with a ticket\, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion\, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet\, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday\, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return\, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books\, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \nIn collaboration with:\n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Celestial Dance
DESCRIPTION:The ancient Indian Panchanga\, or Hindu calendar\, is a remarkable synthesis of astronomy\, mathematics\, and cultural tradition. This unique event brings it alive using modern Stellarium astronomy software\, where celestial movements will be visualised through simple planetary animations. \nParticipants will learn the meaning of terms like Masa\, Paksha\, Tithi\, and Nakshatra\, and discover why our festivals shift dates each year\, why months have 30 or 31 days\, why there are 12 zodiac signs\, and why exactly 27 nakshatras govern the skies. These everyday questions find their answers in the ingenious design of the Panchanga. \nThe session also highlights the rich heritage of the Hindu school of astronomy. Flourishing for over 1\,500 years and reaching a peak during the Vijayanagar period\, with Kerala as its vibrant epicenter\, this tradition produced profound insights into planetary motion and time. The ancient text Surya Siddhanta went even further\, defining multiple scales of time—from a human day (sunrise to sunrise)\, to a day of the Pitrs (a lunar month)\, to a day of the gods (a solar year). It even stretched the imagination to the grand cosmic cycles of parardha—155.52 trillion years—down to the fleeting span of prana\, a few seconds. \nBy blending science with storytelling\, speaker S. Kishore Kumar will reveal how the Hindu calendar is not just a tool for marking festivals\, but a timeless scientific framework that connects human life to the rhythms of the cosmos. \nPresented by:\n \nSupported by:\n  \n

SUMMARY:Artie’s Festival India
DESCRIPTION:Join us for an evening of timeless music spanning the Classical\, Romantic\, and operatic traditions. \nThe program opens with Mozart’s Sonata for Violin and Piano K. 379\, followed by two highlights from Handel’s Giulio Cesare in Egitto: the stately “Ouverture” and the aria “Piangerò la sorte mia.” Three elegant songs by Reynaldo Hahn—Décrets indolents du hasard\, L’heure exquise\, and La dernière valse—close the first half. \nAfter the interval\, Schubert’s expansive Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat major\, Op. 99 takes center stage\, before the concert ends on a lighthearted note with Offenbach’s witty operetta numbers: Ah que j’aime les militaires and Tu n’es pas riche\, tu n’es pas beau. \nA program of contrasts—poised and playful\, intimate and grand—this evening offers a journey through some of Europe’s most beloved musical voices. \nPresented by: \n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Magdalana Mariam
DESCRIPTION:\nWhat awakens within us when temptation gives way to truth? \nThis performance in chaste Malayalam brings to life Mahakavi Vallathol Menon’s lyrical poem Magdalana Mariam through the timeless vocabulary of Bharatanatyam. The poem narrates the story of Mariam\, a woman who rises from poverty to wealth\, only to find herself ensnared by pride and desire. One night\, a moment of stark realization shatters her illusions\, revealing the emptiness of her existence. \nHer encounter with Christ transforms this despair into redemption\, and it is this very arc from vanity to awakening\, that unfolds on stage. Through evocative abhinaya\, intricate rhythm\, and the expressive power of Bharatanatyam\, the performance turns Vallathol’s poetry into a moving meditation on the possibility of renewal. \nA story of loss\, grace\, and transformation\, waiting to be felt through movement and verse! \n \n \nCredits: \nMusic: Dr. O.S.

SUMMARY:Romantic Visions: Scriabin\, Liszt\, and Chopin
DESCRIPTION:Hailed by CBC Music as one of Canada’s finest young musicians\, pianist Tony Yike Yang first captured international attention at just sixteen\, when he became the youngest-ever laureate of the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. Since then\, he has appeared in some of the world’s leading concert halls\, from Carnegie Hall and the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre to the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory\, performing with major orchestras including the Cleveland Orchestra\, Warsaw Philharmonic\, and Orchestre Métropolitain. \nThis evening\, he presents a programme that traces a sweeping arc through the Romantic imagination. Scriabin’s early Preludes open the program alongside his rarely heard Fantasy in B minor. Liszt follows with two contrasting masterpieces: the intimate Sonetto 104 del Petrarca\, and the dazzling Mephisto Waltz No. 1\, one of Liszt’s most iconic showpieces. The program culminates in Chopin’s Sonata in B minor. Together\, these works highlight the Romantic piano’s full expressive range\, brought to life by Tony Yike Yang’s artistry. \n \nSupported by: \n    \n

SUMMARY:ಸಂಗಮ | Sangama | Coming Together
DESCRIPTION:67 minutes | Kannada\, English and Hindi with English subtitles | Germany\, India | 2025 \nOn January 22\, 2024\, much of India came to a halt as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a grand temple to Lord Ram\, built on the contested site of a demolished mosque. The spectacle\, meticulously staged\, gave the ruling party a decisive advantage ahead of the 2024 Indian elections\, further splintering an already divided opposition. \nSangama is a powerful portrait of democracy at work in Southern India. The film follows the campaign of Wake-up Karnataka (WK)\, a citizen-led coalition mobilizing national networks to challenge the decade-long dominance of the BJP. \nJourneying with Team WK\, by train\, car\, and on foot\, the film captures their efforts to steer clear of polarizing rhetoric and instead spotlight urgent\, everyday issues: unemployment\, farmer distress\, and the rising cost of essentials. “Our tradition has taught us to love and not hate\,” one senior member affirms\, encapsulating their ethos. \nFrom intimate community meetings and voter registration drives to the energy of massive political rallies\, an intricate mosaic of the Indian election unfolds. Voices from the ground echo the people’s concerns: “Modi may have done a lot for the rich\, but daily wagers haven’t benefited at all.” \nAs the summer intensifies\, so do the campaigns—and with them\, caste-based clashes stirred by political forces. Meanwhile\, the Prime Minister amplifies anti-Muslim rhetoric\, unsettled that strident Hindu nationalism is losing its appeal. Protests demanding accountability from pliant election officials expose the unevenness of the playing field. Through it all\, Team WK persists\, moving village to village\, booth to booth\, ensuring that people cast their votes. \nCommissioned by the Centre for Modern Indian Studies\, Göttingen\, Germany\, the film is part of Election Diaries 2024\, a series of nine campaigns across India that celebrate the resilience of democracy. At a time when authoritarian regimes are on the rise and narrow visions of nationhood threaten to erase cultural plurality\, Sangama reminds us that an alternative vision of collective resistance and unity endures. \nThe screening will be followed by an interactive discussion with Tara Rao\, Noor Sridhar and Mallige Sirimane from Eddelu Karnataka\, and filmmaker Sunanda Bhat. The session\, moderated by Pooja Prasanna\, will conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Samyoga – Khayal Se Kriti Tak
DESCRIPTION:Shared roots\, divergent paths: listen as tradition and expression entwine! \nSamyoga brings together Hindustani and Carnatic music in a rare exploration of sound\, emotion\, and tradition. Conceptualised and presented by Dr. Radhika Joshi (Hindustani Vocal) and Manasi Prasad (Carnatic Vocal)\, the performance celebrates both the shared ancestry and the distinctive aesthetics of these classical systems. \nTraversing genres from the gravitas of classical forms to the devotion of Bhakti Sangeet and the lyrical beauty of Thumri and Jawali\, each piece highlights how the two traditions converse\, diverge\, and find harmony. Beyond their mastery as performers\, Radhika and Manasi are accomplished researchers\, bringing deep theoretical understanding and insight into the evolution\, structure\, and nuances of Indian music. Through a seamless blend of narration and performance\, Samyoga transforms listening into discovery\, revealing connections and contrasts that are rarely experienced together. \nAn evening of sound\, story\, and subtle interplay\, this is a unique opportunity to witness these two traditions unite in conversation! \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Navalny
DESCRIPTION:98 minutes | English\, Russian and German | 2022 \nEnthralling and intimate\, the Oscar-winning documentary Navalny\, directed by Daniel Roher\, unfolds with the pace of a thriller as it follows Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny in his quest to identify the men who poisoned him in August 2020. Shot in Germany as the story unfolded\, the film offers extraordinary access to the investigation while also portraying Navalny the man—a reformist leader who refuses to be cowed\, even by an assassination attempt. \nThe documentary takes viewers inside the meticulous investigation into the shocking poisoning\, revealing who was behind it. Navalny’s years-long campaign against corruption among Russia’s elites has earned him powerful enemies\, particularly Vladimir Putin\, who pointedly refuses to utter his name in public. In August 2020\, Navalny was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent in an elaborate attempt on his life. Despite official denials\, independent investigations by Bellingcat\, CNN\, and others later linked the attack to the Kremlin. \nThe film Navalny is produced by Odessa Rae (RaeFilm Studios)\, Diane Becker and Melanie Miller (Fishbowl Films)\, Shane Boris (Cottage M)\, and Amy Entelis and Courtney Sexton (CNN Films)\, with Maria Pevchikh as executive producer. \nFollowing the screening\, a discussion between Aakar Patel and Swati Dandekar will take place\, followed by an audience Q&A. \nPlease note: director Daniel Roher will not be present. \nViewer discretion: Children under 17 are restricted from viewing the film unless accompanied by an adult. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Rasika
DESCRIPTION:What do you really see when a classical dancer takes the stage? \nIs it the beauty of the movement\, the rhythm of the music\, or the story unfolding before your eyes? This evening invites you to look closer\, to discover the richness within Indian classical dance; the traditional repertoire\, the interplay of melody and rhythm\, the subtle gestures that carry meaning\, and the role of texts that shape interpretation. \nGuided by Dr. Sahana Das\, a seasoned choreographer and researcher\, the session opens up the world of classical dance in ways that both newcomers and longtime rasikas can enjoy. Adding depth and texture are dancers Kirti Ramgopal and Meghna Das\, who bring their own artistry in Bharatanatyam and Odissi to the conversation. \nThrough reflection and performance\, the evening gently unravels the intricacies of these timeless traditions\, reminding us that dance is not just to be seen: it is to be experienced\, understood\, and felt! \n
