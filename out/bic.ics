SUMMARY:390. Confessions of a Lobbyist
DESCRIPTION:Insider accounts from political aides\, bureaucrats\, and diplomats have long illuminated the workings of power—but even more enigmatic were the lobbyists. Operating in the shadows\, often invisible to public scrutiny\, they were intimately privy to clandestine negotiations\, back-channel discussions\, and subtle bureaucratic skirmishes. In his new roman-à-clef For No Reason At All\, Ramjee Chandran shines a light on this hidden world. \nChandran—well‑known in Bangalore as a journalist\, publisher\, and podcaster—has\, until now\, remained silent about his time as a lobbyist in 1980s New Delhi\, a pivotal era just before major economic reforms took hold. \nDrawing from real events\, the novel charts the journey of a young lobbyist caught in a high-stakes conflict over silicon metal—a material deemed strategically vital. Central to the drama is Metkem Silicon\, which\, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore\, devoted 17 years to developing indigenous silicon metal technology. Yet their efforts collided with a rival scheme spearheaded by the Department of Electronics\, which wanted to bypass local innovation and import U.S. technology. \nWhat ensued was a four‑year bureaucratic war: media leaks\, secret memorandums\, and the covert involvement of the Soviets and other intelligence agencies—culminating in a final decision placed in the hands of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. \nSet against the backdrop of Cold War Delhi on the cusp of liberalisation\, the novel paints a vivid portrait of a nation—and capital—torn between ideologies and ambitions. The Soviet Union may have vanished\, lobbyists have receded from public corridors\, and few can claim first‑hand knowledge of that era. \nIn Confessions of a Lobbyist\, Siddharth Raja—a lawyer\, historian\, and bibliophile—sits down with Ramjee Chandran to peel back the layers of this story\, offering an insider’s glimpse into a world that feels at once distant and disarmingly relevant. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks\, Ramjee Chandran will be in conversation with Siddharth Raja. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in Aug 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favourite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere\, including Apple Podcasts\, Spotify\, Google Podcasts\, Castbox\, Overcast\, Audible\, and Amazon Music. \n

SUMMARY:Tat Tvam Asi - Finding Thyself
DESCRIPTION:Tat-Tvam Asi is a meditative dance production that explores the essence of surrender as a path to self-realisation\, through the lives of Andal\, Radha\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu—each a yogi in their own right. Drawing from the Bhagavad Gita\, where Krishna says\, “As all surrender unto Me\, I reward them accordingly\, ” this work reflects the multiple ways one can find the divine: through devotion\, knowledge\, or selfless action. The production unfolds as a series of  vignettes—Andal’s karmic service\, Radha’s longing rooted in bhakti\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s ecstatic sankeertana—interwoven with Krishna ’s own voice as the sutradhar (narrator). From the chariot of Jagannatha in Puri to the quiet sanctum of a temple\, the narrative reveals the beauty of total surrender\, dissolving the ego in divine love. Blending classical dance traditions such as Bharatnatyam and Gaudiya Nritya with original music and poetic texts\, Tat-Tvam Asi is a journey into Krishna Tattvam—the omnipresence of the divine within and around us. \nThe depth of this timeless message and wisdom (familiar to many Vedantic scholars and Indians) was explored by Neha through the many coloured hues of devotion (bhakti) found in ancient lores and cultures. Neha chose the beloved pastoral God Krishna as the focus of bhakti of the devotee. Neha’s approach to Tat Tvam Asi is episodic. Fragments from Andal\, Radha and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were revisited and evoked with compelling conviction through her intense abhinaya. Neha Mondal has conceptualized Tat-Tvam Asi after years of deep reflection on the nature of devotion and surrender. Her creative process involved studying scriptures\, poetry\, and the lives of Andal\, Radha\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to understand their spiritual journeys. She collaborated closely with scholars\, musicians\, and writers to shape a narrative that is both intimate and universal. As a dancer rooted in tradition yet open to exploration\, Neha wove together movement\, music\, and storytelling to evoke the transformative power of bhakti. This production is a culmination of her artistic introspection and spiritual inquiry\, brought to life through dance. \nCredits \nConcept & Choreography: Neha Mondal \nScript: Smt.

SUMMARY:Damaru- Duality
DESCRIPTION:The Damaru\, as an instrument\, manifests the flow of energy between Purusha and Prakriti through its very shape. In it is contained the origin of sound; sound that is the genesis of creation and movement. Conceptualized and choreographed by Vidhya Subramanian\, the work brings together an ensemble of eight dancers – Vidhya Subramanian\, Anu Bhaskararaman\, Anisha Parameswaran\, Archa Shajukumar\, Manasa Vijaychander\, Pranathi Ramadorai\, Sandhya Venkiteshwaram and Subashree S. DAMARU highlights the dualities present within us as well as in the universe—sound and silence\, stillness and movement\, creation and dissolution\, male and female\, self and other\, union and separation – in each of us exists the duality that the universe holds.  \nSparsha Dance Ensemble\, founded by eminent Bharatanatyam dancer Vidhya Subramanian\,  creates new work that brings together concept\, process and intense training. Choreographed and directed by Vidhya Subramanian\, Damaru is Sparsha’s first ensemble work and has received excellent audience feedback. \nSupported by: \n \n
