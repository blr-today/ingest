SUMMARY:Gandhi and Savarkar
DESCRIPTION:Between Gandhi and Savarkar lies the story of India’s unresolved future. \nThe future of India has long been caught between two irreconcilable visions. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar were not just men\, but embodiments of two enduring ideologies: Hind Swaraj and Hindutva. Their contest was never merely personal; it was a struggle over what India could\, and should\, become. \nPartition was one gash on the body of the nation\, its scars still visible. Can India afford new wounds? To even attempt an answer\, we must return to the old antagonisms – between communities\, yes\, but also within Hindu society itself. Few rivalries have been as sharp\, or as consequential\, as that between Gandhi and Savarkar. \nBased on his new book\, Hindutva and Hind Swaraj\, this talk reflects on the unresolved gulf between Gandhi and Savarkar. Not as history\, but as a question that remains open: can such differences ever be bridged\, or are they the fault lines of India’s future? \n

SUMMARY:Mahua Has Always Mattered
DESCRIPTION:Mahua\, the flower of the forest\, carries with it memory\, resilience\, and taste. Once central to community life\, it is now being reclaimed as a symbol of pride\, livelihood\, and ecological care. \nWe begin with a screening of Mahua – Wild Dreams\, Wild Harvest\, a short documentary by Ganesh Tilgam and Priyanshu Raj (Green Hub Fellows). The film traces how ethical harvesting and community-led initiatives are bringing Mahua back into the heart of culture and economy. \nA panel discussion\, Reviving Mahua: From Forest to Future\, follows. Ecologists\, writers\, entrepreneurs\, chefs\, and community members open a many-sided conversation on Mahua’s cultural\, ecological\, and culinary significance. \nThe evening closes with a Mahua Tasting\, where the flower’s delicate sweetness and earthy depth come alive in both savoury and sweet forms. Crafted in collaboration with chefs and food researchers\, this tasting invites you to meet Mahua not just as a plant\, but as an experience of flavour\, memory\, and possibility. \nA flower\, a flavour\, a memory: take Mahua with you in more ways than one. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:A Fly on the Wall
DESCRIPTION:82 minutes | English | 2024 | India \nWhat does it mean to face the end on one’s own terms—and in the company of friends?\n\nA Fly on the Wall\, directed by Nilesh Maniyar and Shonali Bose\, traces the final chapter in the life of Chika Kapadia\, framed through the intimate lens of friendship. In a quiet Swiss town\, loved ones gather from across the world to raise a last toast\, while a filmmaker friend documents the delicate passage between celebration and farewell.

SUMMARY:Beyond the Days of Wine and Roses
DESCRIPTION:India’s first and only Master of Wine\, Sonal C Holland\, sits down with Harish Vasudev\, Director at Museum of Art and Photography\, to talk about her memoir One In A Billion and the remarkable journey which inspired her to write it. \nThis dialogue traces how Sonal walked away from a thriving corporate career and dared to pursue a career in wine even before India knew how to drink it. From knowing nothing about wine\, she embarked on a gruelling decade-long pursuit of the world’s most respected wine qualification. It will also explore her rise as one of the most trusted and popular voices in the alcobev space\, emphasising the importance of self-investment\, ambition without a blueprint\, and chasing success without shortcuts. \nIn this candid conversation\, Sonal will reveal what it takes to build a market from scratch and to lead with vision when no roadmap exists. Drawing from years of entrepreneurship\, leadership\, and global experience\, she will offer a rare perspective on creating impact and shaping an industry against the odds. A Q&A session with the audience will follow the fireside chat. \nPresented by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Rumi Meets Kabeer
DESCRIPTION:A mehfil of mystics where two great voices of devotion find resonance across time and tradition.  \nThis performance weaves together song and story: the earthy nirguni verses of Kabeer alongside the soaring ghazals of Rumi. Tales from Rumi’s Masnavi unfold beside episodes from Kabeer’s life\, drawing audiences into the philosophies that shaped them and the spiritual journeys they invite us to walk. \nThough born in different worlds\, their words echo the same longing: love\, surrender\, and the search for the divine. More than a concert\, the evening offers an immersion into mysticism itself. Music and poetry intertwine\, creating spaces for reflection\, wonder\, and stillness.  \nThis is a celebration of unity in diversity through the timeless legacies of Kabeer and Rumi that continue to awaken the eternal within us. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Reaching for the Stars
DESCRIPTION:What does it take to dream beyond your time—and make those dreams real? \nVikram Sarabhai\, founder of India’s space programme\, imagined communication satellites that would educate people when even a modest rocket launch seemed audacious. He envisioned agricultural complexes powered by atomic energy\, sea water turned drinkable\, and a modern India fuelled by science and creativity. But Sarabhai was more than a scientist—he co-founded the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad\, the National Institute of Design\, the dance academy Darpana\, and India’s first textile research cooperative\, ATIRA. He also ran a thriving pharmaceutical company and launched India’s first market research organisation\, ORG. \nAs India navigates its twenty-first century aspirations\, this session revisits the humane\, imaginative\, yet pragmatic vision of a man who built enduring institutions. Drawing from Vikram Sarabhai: A Life\, author Amrita Shah offers an intimate portrait of a multifaceted genius whose legacy continues to shape India’s present and future. She will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey\, exploring the many lives and lasting vision of this extraordinary builder of modern India. \nThe conversation will conclude with an audience Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:KABIR: A Dance Production
DESCRIPTION:How do centuries-old verses find new life in rhythm and movement? \nKABIR is a Bharatanatyam production that brings the timeless poetry of Sant Kabir into conversation with dance. What makes this work unique is the seamless weaving of Kabir’s Hindi verses into the expressive framework of Bharatanatyam\, guided by the musical brilliance of Vidwan O. S. Arun. His evocative vocals create a living bridge between word and movement\, allowing the spiritual depth of Kabir’s poetry to bloom on stage. \nConceived and choreographed by Varsha Akhouri\, alumna and former faculty of the Kalakshetra Foundation\, the production embodies both tradition and innovation. With her students carrying forward the performance\, the piece becomes not just a retelling of Kabir’s verses but a passing on of artistic legacy. \nKabir’s words question dogma\, transcend boundaries\, and call us to simplicity\, love\, and self-realisation. In this production\, poetry and dance converge to reveal their continued resonance with our fragmented world. \nA performance for the divine within and without. \nCredits:\nMusic and Vocals: O S Arun\nConcept and Choreography: Varsha Akhouri\nTabla: Martin\nMridangam: Shivaprasad\nSitar: Kishore\nFlute: Hariprasad\nSound engineer: Rakesh\nJathi: Sheejith Krishna\nLights: Venkatesh Krishna \nDancers:\nAsika Sajeevan\nAarathi S Nair\nDevika AC\nJisma K.K\nRoopesh PP\nShobhit Shivhare\nSreelakshmi EB\nSreeshna KM\nSreerejini NS \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Gandhi
DESCRIPTION:Can dance translate the restlessness of a conscience\, the weight of compassion? \nWith Gandhi\, choreographer C P Satyajit reimagines the Mahatma’s life and philosophy through the timeless language of Bharatanatyam. This is not a chronological retelling\, but a meditation on his ideals: his restless pursuit of truth\, his unwavering sense of justice\, his profound connection with people. \nThrough delicate abhinaya and layered rhythmic improvisations\, the production traces Gandhi’s journey as both a leader and a seeker. Informed by the research of Dr. V R Devika\, whose PhD explored Gandhi’s communication strategies\, the work captures how his ideals might continue to move us\, literally and metaphorically\, today.\n\nIn this unique performance\, every gesture is a reminder that truth and compassion remain unfinished tasks. \nCredits:\nConcept & Choreography: C P Satyajit \nDancers:\nKeerthana Ganesan\nDevikha S\nHemavathy Kalaiarasan\nParvathi Parameswar\nArchana Sivasubramanian\nAnjannaa Ashok \nMusicians\nM S Sukhi: Rhythm\nMonali Bala: Voice\nManonmani T: Sarangi \nOriginal Lighting Design: Martin Jose\nOperated by: Muthukumar R \nThe production is created by Bharata Kalanjali with the support of the Kaladham Trust and Sarvodaya International\, Karnataka. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n  \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Celestial Dance
DESCRIPTION:The ancient Indian Panchanga\, or Hindu calendar\, is a remarkable synthesis of astronomy\, mathematics\, and cultural tradition. This unique event brings it alive using modern Stellarium astronomy software\, where celestial movements will be visualised through simple planetary animations. \nParticipants will learn the meaning of terms like Masa\, Paksha\, Tithi\, and Nakshatra\, and discover why our festivals shift dates each year\, why months have 30 or 31 days\, why there are 12 zodiac signs\, and why exactly 27 nakshatras govern the skies. These everyday questions find their answers in the ingenious design of the Panchanga. \nThe session also highlights the rich heritage of the Hindu school of astronomy. Flourishing for over 1\,500 years and reaching a peak during the Vijayanagar period\, with Kerala as its vibrant epicenter\, this tradition produced profound insights into planetary motion and time. The ancient text Surya Siddhanta went even further\, defining multiple scales of time—from a human day (sunrise to sunrise)\, to a day of the Pitrs (a lunar month)\, to a day of the gods (a solar year). It even stretched the imagination to the grand cosmic cycles of parardha—155.52 trillion years—down to the fleeting span of prana\, a few seconds. \nBy blending science with storytelling\, speaker S. Kishore Kumar will reveal how the Hindu calendar is not just a tool for marking festivals\, but a timeless scientific framework that connects human life to the rhythms of the cosmos. \nIn collaboration with:\n   \n

SUMMARY:Artie’s Festival India
DESCRIPTION:Join us for an evening of timeless music spanning the Classical\, Romantic\, and operatic traditions. \nThe program opens with Mozart’s Sonata for Violin and Piano K. 379\, followed by two highlights from Handel’s Giulio Cesare in Egitto: the stately “Ouverture” and the aria “Piangerò la sorte mia.” Three elegant songs by Reynaldo Hahn—Décrets indolents du hasard\, L’heure exquise\, and La dernière valse—close the first half. \nAfter the interval\, Schubert’s expansive Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat major\, Op. 99 takes center stage\, before the concert ends on a lighthearted note with Offenbach’s witty operetta numbers: Ah que j’aime les militaires and Tu n’es pas riche\, tu n’es pas beau. \nA program of contrasts—poised and playful\, intimate and grand—this evening offers a journey through some of Europe’s most beloved musical voices. \nPresented by: \n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:ಸಂಗಮ | Sangama | Coming Together
DESCRIPTION:67 minutes | Kannada\, English and Hindi with English subtitles | Germany\, India | 2025 \nOn January 22\, 2024\, much of India came to a halt as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a grand temple to Lord Ram\, built on the contested site of a demolished mosque. The spectacle\, meticulously staged\, gave the ruling party a decisive advantage ahead of the 2024 Indian elections\, further splintering an already divided opposition. \nSangama is a powerful portrait of democracy at work in Southern India. The film follows the campaign of Wake-up Karnataka (WK)\, a citizen-led coalition mobilizing national networks to challenge the decade-long dominance of the BJP. \nJourneying with Team WK\, by train\, car\, and on foot\, the film captures their efforts to steer clear of polarizing rhetoric and instead spotlight urgent\, everyday issues: unemployment\, farmer distress\, and the rising cost of essentials. “Our tradition has taught us to love and not hate\,” one senior member affirms\, encapsulating their ethos. \nFrom intimate community meetings and voter registration drives to the energy of massive political rallies\, an intricate mosaic of the Indian election unfolds. Voices from the ground echo the people’s concerns: “Modi may have done a lot for the rich\, but daily wagers haven’t benefited at all.” \nAs the summer intensifies\, so do the campaigns—and with them\, caste-based clashes stirred by political forces. Meanwhile\, the Prime Minister amplifies anti-Muslim rhetoric\, unsettled that strident Hindu nationalism is losing its appeal. Protests demanding accountability from pliant election officials expose the unevenness of the playing field. Through it all\, Team WK persists\, moving village to village\, booth to booth\, ensuring that people cast their votes. \nCommissioned by the Centre for Modern Indian Studies\, Göttingen\, Germany\, the film is part of Election Diaries 2024\, a series of nine campaigns across India that celebrate the resilience of democracy. At a time when authoritarian regimes are on the rise and narrow visions of nationhood threaten to erase cultural plurality\, Sangama reminds us that an alternative vision of collective resistance and unity endures. \nThe screening will be followed by an interactive discussion with Tara Rao\, Noor Sridhar and Mallige Sirimane from Eddelu Karnataka\, and filmmaker Sunanda Bhat. The session\, moderated by Pooja Prasanna\, will conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \n
