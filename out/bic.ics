SUMMARY:The Twist in the Odyssey of Naxalism in Karnataka
DESCRIPTION:Around 15 years ago\, the then UPA government had launched an all-out offensive (commonly known as ‘Operation Greenhunt’) targeting the armed cadres of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) (also known as Naxalites) across the ‘Red Corridor’ which consisted of Naxal-affected districts spanning Central and Eastern India and spilling into Southern India as well. According to reports at the time\, Naxal cadres were active (to varying degrees) in at least 165 districts across this corridor which was also coterminous with the most backward\, primarily tribal and the most resource rich parts of the country. The BJP government\, which came to power in 2014\, continued this policy of an all-out offensive against the Naxalites extending this to target the urban activists/ sympathisers of the CPI (Maoist) as well.  \nThere has been a marked decline in Naxalite activity since then with the number of affected districts falling to 70 in 2021 and newer reports suggesting that the Naxalite presence is restricted to fewer than 50 districts now. In a strong policy statement\, Home Minister Amit stated that “Naxalism will be completely eliminated by 2026.” Human rights activists have questioned the state’s all-out approach of using overwhelming force to quash Naxalism as this method is not addressing the fundamental grievances of the residents of these tribal parts which is of their displacement and exploitation of the rich natural resources by large corporations. Several Naxalites have surrendered over the past two decades but questions have also been raised on the efficacy and sincerity of the surrender policy.  \nKarnataka was also impacted by the wave of Naxalism and\, commencing in the 1980s\, cadres were recruited for this cause in the State as well. In the 1990s\, it seemed like the movement was spreading its base in Karnataka aggressively but a series of encounters including that of Saketh Rajan\, the charismatic Naxal leader\, in 2005\, ensured that the movement did not become widespread in Karnataka. There was also intense churn among a section of the cadres of the CPI (Maoist) in Karnataka after this as well with one group exiting the party as it had ideological differences with the central leadership of the party. Over the two decades since that time\, the Naxalite movement has ebbed in Karnataka with several Naxalites also surrendering. Early in 2025\, with the “surrender” of the last group of Naxalites in Karnataka\, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah declared the state to be Naxal-free. The Karnataka model presents a template of how Naxalism\, in its violent form\, can be ended. By all accounts\, the Karnataka model is unique for the manner in which former Naxalites joined the mainstream of activism. The role of the mature civil society in Karnataka that played a crucial role in facilitating this process is also important. \nThe discussion proposes to dwell on the trajectory of Naxalism in Karnataka from its inception in the 1980s till early 2025\, and whether the state is willing to seriously engage with the grievances of marginalised people who became Naxals. Is the state empathetic to the concerns of the Naxalites who came overground? The discussion proposes to dwell on all these aspects while broadly focussing on the success of the Karnataka model of mainstreaming Left-Wing Extremists.  \n

SUMMARY:Chief Justice Ahmadi & the Idea of India
DESCRIPTION:In the 1940s\, a rebellious teenager tore through the bustling lanes of Surat’s Dawoodi Bohra mohalla on his rickety bicycle\, noisily jangling his rusty bell. Obsessed with cricket\, mischief and pranks\, nobody could have predicted then that young Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi would one day stride across the glittering halls of the Rashtrapati Bhavan to swear in as the third Muslim Chief Justice of India. \nThis is the story of Justice A.M. Ahmadi —26th Chief Justice of India — who served during some of India’s most turbulent political and legal moments. From his powerful dissent in the Babri Masjid case as he withstood immense political pressures\, the fight for federalism in S R Bommai to his extraordinary courage in the unforgettable General Vaidya assassination case\, his legacy is remembered for safeguarding democracy and the social fabric of our nation.  \nBut beyond the courtroom\, his story is also one of personal struggles and conviction—navigating a world often hostile to religious minorities\, protecting others from the same\, or confronting difficult questions of identity and dissent within his own community. For Justice Ahmadi\, secularism wasn’t just a legal principle—it was a way of life. \nPart biography\, part legal history\, and part family memoir— this book\, written by Justice Ahmadi’s granddaughter\, is a journey through the corridors of power and an unflinching portrait of a man who dared to speak truth to power no matter the consequences.  \nIn this session\, author and journalist Insiyah Vahanvaty speaks with senior advocate and legal scholar Aditya Sondhi about her deeply personal and powerfully political biography\, The Fearless Judge:The Life and Times of Justice A M Ahmadi. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:366. A Date with Bangalore
DESCRIPTION:What makes a city uniquely itself? Is it its geography\, history\, location\, demographic? Is it its leaders\, influencers\, inspirations? Or is it something else\, an undefinable but palpable spirit\, wrought over centuries of a combination of all these\, that seeps into the soil and charges the air\, infecting residents and visitors alike? \nTwo decades of exploring\, discovering\, researching – and reading\, writing\, and talking – about her hometown have convinced Roopa Pai\, author\, columnist\, and co-founder of the heritage walks and tours company\, BangaloreWalks\, that the latter is true – cities are neither born nor made\, they become. Her collection of evocative essays on the city have now been compiled into a book\, Becoming Bangalore\, published by Hachette India. \nIn her conversation with Brinda S Narayan\, Roopa will dive into the city’s history to tease out bits of the Bangalore jigsaw – a chieftain’s decision\, a Commissioner’s inclusiveness\, a scientist’s quest for excellence\, a Dewan’s conviction\, a missionary’s zeal\, a Maharani’s foresight\, an entrepreneur’s vision\, an industrialist’s generosity\, an activist’s passion\, a common man’s ambition\, a writer’s pride in his language – in an effort to track down the genesis of Bangalore’s modern\, progressive\, liberal spirit. \nWhat she hopes will emerge from that discussion are tantalizing hints that reveal how a little 16th century settlement on a hill became India’s most charismatic city. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks\, Roopa Pai will be in conversation with Brinda S. Narayan. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in April 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere\, including Apple Podcasts\, Spotify\, Google Podcasts\, Castbox\, Overcast\, Audible\, and Amazon Music. \n

SUMMARY:Blueprints of Strength
DESCRIPTION:This session offers a deep and reflective exploration of India’s journey toward self-reliance in defence research and development\, inspired by the DRDO publication “Endeavours in Self-Reliance: Defence Research 1983–2018”\, by KG Narayanan. The book captures a critical period of transformation in India’s defence landscape\, chronicling key achievements\, institutional efforts\, and the steady march toward technological autonomy over three and a half decades. \nThe session will open with a keynote presentation by Mr. Narayanan\, who will outline the central themes and insights drawn from the book. This includes the evolution of DRDO’s role\, the emergence of indigenous capabilities\, and the broader strategic imperative of self-reliance in defence. The presentation will set the stage for a nuanced conversation about the motivations\, challenges\, and breakthroughs that have defined India’s R&D efforts in the defence sector. \nFollowing the keynote\, a panel discussion will bring together eminent voices who have been closely involved in shaping this journey. Dr Samir V. Kamat\, Chairman DRDO and Secretary\, Department of Defence R&D; Dr S. Christopher\, former Chairman DRDO; and Dr Anantha Krishnan M\, senior defence journalist and author\, will engage in a dynamic exchange of perspectives. The discussion will be moderated by Air Marshal (Retd.) P Rajkumar\, providing context and continuity across decades of institutional memory and technological evolution. \nTogether\, the panel will reflect not only on past achievements but also on the pressing needs and strategic directions for the future\, offering valuable insights into what it will take to secure and sustain a truly self-reliant defence ecosystem in India. \n

SUMMARY:And a Story Came Tumbling Down...
DESCRIPTION:What happens when you tumble down a hill and land on a secret? \nBased on a true story of a botanist who accidentally rediscovered a rare orchid in the forests of Tamil Nadu. The session begins with a live reading of Botanist and the Vanishing Orchid\, a comic inspired by real events followed by a hands-on workshop where participants complete a comic of their own. With some panels already illustrated and others left blank\, you get to imagine the characters\, twist the plot\, and decide how the tale ends. \n

SUMMARY:Tarana vs Thillana
DESCRIPTION:Tarana and Thillana—two strikingly vibrant forms in Hindustani and Carnatic classical traditions—share more than just syllabic play and rhythmic flair. Yet\, they are often misunderstood\, conflated\, or heard in isolation. \nThis workshop invites participants to explore the shared pulse and divergent expressions of these two forms. Through live demonstrations\, guided listening\, and cross-cultural comparison\, we will experience the same raga unfold as a Tarana and a Thillana\, tracing how it transforms in structure\, tempo\, and mood across styles. \nThe session will introduce key rhythmic devices like layakari\, jatis\, and tihais\, explore improvisation techniques in each tradition\, and unpack the role of these forms in both concert and dance settings. Alongside a deep listening experience\, participants will also gain a historical understanding of how Tarana and Thillana evolved and how they continue to be shaped by performance and pedagogy today. \nLed by expert practitioners from both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions\, this workshop is designed for listeners\, learners\, dancers\, and musicians alike—anyone curious to hear\, feel\, and understand rhythm as language and lineage. \n

SUMMARY:Step In the Frame
DESCRIPTION:This two-piece contemporary dance performance explores the body’s inner battles and breakthroughs. While one piece unravels self-doubt; the other captures the pulse of transformation. \nMetamorphosis \nThe dancers explore the reactions of what happens when one goes through the process of transformation. How does one’s body’s senses and feelings react through this unending loop between creation of new patterns\, destruction\, and recreation of one another. Metamorphosis dives deep into the question of how a pattern impacts the body? And during the period of transition when old patterns are fading away and the new self is finding its expression in the world\, what is then your relationship to the changed self\, and how does your body respond to this change? What is this new self? Is it an add-on to the old pattern or a breakaway into something new? \nLost in Oscillation \nThis piece carries us into the surreal world of self-doubt; shifting\, strange\, and deeply personal. The dancer moves through a dreamlike space\, where self-doubt becomes a physical presence that twists the body and unsettles the mind. Reflections fragment across the stage\, echoing the dancer’s inner conflict. Movements swing between sharp tension and quiet stillness\, capturing the push and pull of uncertainty. With haunting sound and abstract visuals\, the piece invites you into a world where even your own reflection feels unfamiliar. It’s not just a performance—it’s a glimpse into the shifting terrain of the self. \nSupported by: \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:You Can Change Friends but Not Neighbours
DESCRIPTION:India’s foreign policy towards Pakistan reflects the reality that while friends may change\, neighbours are permanent. Dialogue\, deterrence\, and diplomacy remain key. Despite tensions\, India seeks peaceful coexistence\, emphasising counter-terrorism and regional stability while keeping open channels for engagement\, recognising geography’s role in shaping long-term strategic approaches. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University’s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Unfolding Memory: Many People\, Many Desires
DESCRIPTION:45 minutes | English\, Kannada\, Tamil\, Malayalam and Hindi with English subtitles | 2004 \nAs part of BIC’s Pride Programs\, this session will include a screening of T Jayashree’s Many People\, Many Desires\, followed by a panel discussion with T Jayashree\, Mira Brunner and Siddharth Narrain. \nMany People\, Many Desires is centered around the interviews of many members of the LGBTQ community in Bangalore at the time. The film was shot entirely in a MiniDV tape format. Starting from an exploration of sexuality and human rights\, it allows the viewer to hear the first-person narratives of some of those who were engaged with the sexuality movement of the time – whose work is instrumental for the fight for legal rights for queer people in India. \nUsing legal discrimination against sexual minorities as its starting point\, the film explores the relationship between class\, sexuality\, and gender. The film captures early years in the movement against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code\, a colonial law which criminalized homosexual behavior and has now\, through efforts which included some of those interviewed in the film\, been read down. \nThe panel will talk about what has changed\, what has remained the same\, and QAMRA’s (the Queer Archive of Memory\, Reflection\, and Activism) attempts to preserve this history. They will discuss their perspectives on archiving queer material and the responsibilities of preserving what is still in living memory. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis year\, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is — unconforming\, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates\, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society\, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression. Pride\, Insists Upon Itself! \n

SUMMARY:The Third Moment
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the promise of equal citizenship begins to fade for one of the world’s largest Muslim populations? In today’s India\, the question is no longer theoretical\, but urgent and deeply personal for over 200 million people. \nThis session explores the shifting political landscape of Indian Muslims through the lens of Shikwa-e-Hind\, the new book by political scientist Mujibur Rehman. He examines what he calls their “third political moment\,” a phase marked by the erosion of constitutional equality and the rise of a majoritarian ethos since 2014. Tracing the arc from the aftermath of 1857\, through the hopeful vision of 1947\, to today’s polarised climate\, Rehman invites a critical look at the future of democratic participation for Indian Muslims. \nThe conversation features Mujibur Rehman in dialogue with author and columnist Aakar Patel and moderated by journalist Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed. They will explore the tension between constitutional ideals and majoritarian pressures\, the structural challenges of representation\, and the possibilities for reclaiming dignity\, rights\, and democratic participation for Indian Muslims. The session will conclude with a Q&A\, offering space for your questions in what promises to be an inclusive and engaging discussion. \n

DESCRIPTION:Many Things is a cross genre instrumental trio\, treading the fine line between composition and improvisation. The inventive tapestry of sound and music takes the listener on a journey full of twists and turns. \nTheir second album Two Many Things is still about the development of ideas in sound – spontaneous and instantaneous – but the compositional element is more pronounced\, with emphasis on structure\, where soloistic endeavors happen in a collective space. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Leela
DESCRIPTION:Experience an intimate evening of evocative acoustic music with Sanjay Divecha\, one of India’s most celebrated guitarists.

SUMMARY:The History of Welfare
DESCRIPTION:Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press\, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day\, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment\, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India’s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development\, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of ‘direct benefits’ which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session\, Louise Tillin\, the author of the book\, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair\, NLS.  \n
