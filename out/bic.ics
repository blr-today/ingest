Practice for AFA is understood more in the form of an atelier or a work-shop which is known for a certain way of doing things\, approach to questions\, craft\, and other related qualities. Like most good ateliers\, the focus is to produce ideas for good architecture and the method and modality of putting these ideas forward has been the physical model. \nAFA was established in 2011 by Ajay Sonar and Monali Patil in Nashik. AFA has won several awards\, including the Archdaily’s 2021 New Practices. Their work has been exhibited at Time Space Existence in Venice in 2023.

SUMMARY:The Arduous Pursuit of Dignity for All
DESCRIPTION:This talk draws from Matthias Mahlmann’s recent critically acclaimed book\, Mind and Rights: The history\, law and psychology of Human Rights published in open access mode by Cambridge University Press in February 2023.  The talk critically examines the growth of the concept of human rights\, its roots in history and current human rights theories. It scrutinizes in particular the myth of the Western origin of the idea of human rights by highlighting the many roots of human rights in different cultures\, including within the Global South and indigenous cultures. \nA particular goal of the talk is to engage with the so-called cognitive revolution and to investigate the relationship between human cognition and human rights.  The talk will argue that insights gained from modern theories of the mind can deepen our understanding of the foundation of human rights. The talk also seeks to answer the question whether the current attacks on democracy can be countered through the use of human rights and its underlying political ethics of egalitarian dignity. Finally\, the talk will contend that the pursuit of the human rights idea\, with its achievements and tragic failures\, is key to understanding what kind of beings humans are. Such self-knowledge is crucial in times in which the human species has put its own survival at risk. \nA conversation between the author\, Matthias Mahlmann\, and the discussant\, Sudhir Krishnaswamy\, will be followed by a moderated Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Living Wills
DESCRIPTION:An Advance Medical Directive (AMD) (usually misunderstood as a Living Will) recognizes the right of a person to choose the nature of medical treatment that he/she would like to be withheld. It is an extension of the principle of the right to die with dignity. An AMD is a person’s advanced exercise of autonomy on the subject of the level of medical intervention they intend to accept on their own body at a time when they may not be able to express their views. The objective and intent of an AMD are to convey a person’s medical care preferences if they lose their ability to make decisions. \nIn March 2018\, the Supreme Court of India\, in a landmark judgement\, recognized the right of a terminally ill person to execute an Advance Medical Directive. AMD helps in protecting basic human autonomy\, while also shedding light on the concept of dignity in death. However\, it is still a new concept in India and early last year the Supreme Court modified its guidelines for the execution of the Living Will. \nThis session by Mr. Shiv Kumar will delve into the Advanced Medical Directive and will examine the ingredients of an AMD\, its legal nuances\, how and when it can be made\, and its consequences. It will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience and enable a discussion on the barriers that impact the efficacy of the AMD. \nIn collaboration with Silver Talkies\, a social enterprise focused on making active ageing a desirable and viable goal for older adults:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Costs of Political Corruption
DESCRIPTION:In the era of electoral bonds\, the costs of political corruption demand scrutiny. Today’s corruption differs vastly from that of a decade or two ago\, altering its associated consequences. \nThe captive coal block allocation scandal entrenched oligarchy by favoring select families\, while in states like Punjab\, corruption consolidates power within a single family\, depriving the state of revenue. Presently\, India witnesses a surge in a rent-sharing model\, akin to a mafia state\, where government support disproportionately benefits chosen firms. This breakdown in the citizen-party social contract prompts reporter M Rajshekhar to analyze its origins and effects. \nAbout Narayan Dutt:\nMr Narayan Dutt was a Hindi journalist. He retired as the Features Editor of PTI Hindi division. He was earlier Editor of Navaneet\, a Hindi digest\, for many years. He was highly regarded by his peers and received honours such as the Sri Ganesh Shanker Vidhyarthi Puraskar bestowed by the President of India\, and an Honorary D. Lit by Makhanlal Chaturvedi Rashtriya Patrakarita evam Sanchar Vishwavidyalay\, Bhopal. His date of birth is 17 February 1929. The last few speakers have included the journalist Mr P Sainath\,  the film-maker Mr Girish Kasaravalli\, the sociologist Prof Amita Baviskar of Asoka University and Prof Krishna Achuta Rao of the Department of Climate Change\,IIT Delhi. \nThis event is in collaboration with Devagitam Charitable Trust (R)\, Mysuru & Abhijnana\, Bengaluru: \n \n

SUMMARY:China through Another Prism
DESCRIPTION:Discussions surrounding China and India’s relationship remain urgent and crucial due to their geopolitical significance\, economic interdependence\, and potential for conflict. As two of the world’s most populous nations and emerging global powers\, their interactions shape regional stability and have far-reaching implications for international relations. With ongoing territorial disputes\, trade tensions\, and differing strategic interests\, understanding and managing their relationship is vital for fostering cooperation\, averting conflicts\, and navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing world order. \nExploring themes from his book Beyond Binaries: The World of India and China based on his writings on India\, China and their often-tumultuous relationship\, Shastri Ramachandaran unravels a succinct history of how ties between the two Asian neighbours have evolved over the 15 years from 2008–2022 and the internal and bilateral compulsions that shaped them. The book makes the reader aware about the strategic thinking that went into each move and counter-move by the two nations that are often at odds with each other\, as they are at present. It is an attempt to deepen understanding of the recent history of Sino-Indian relations and\, as the title suggests\, look at India-China relations without putting it in the category of good or bad. \nIn this session\, author Shastri Ramachandran will be in conversation with Manoj Kewalramani taking the listener beyond the binaries in which perceptions of India and China\, their relationship and their role on the world stage is trapped. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:The Gods Who Come Down from Heaven
DESCRIPTION:In this illustrated lecture\, Pepita Seth presents her decades of work on Theyyams published in her recent book\, In God’s Mirror: The Theyyams of Malabar. The word ‘Theyyam’ is a corruption of ‘daiva’\, meaning\, quite simply\, God. Theyyam is an act of worship that brings the deities down from heaven to be among their devotees. The practitioners of Theyyam perform specific rituals and dance to express their joy at seeing their devotees\, while the last stages of their manifestation involve them in blessing\, healing\, exorcising\, answering questions and maintaining the link between humanity and the divine. While the process is an internal one that obliterates the practitioner’s human persona\, on an external level his face is transformed by intricate make-up and his body fantastically costumed. There are Theyyams for Gods and Goddesses\, warrior heroes\, wronged women\, ghosts\, spirits\, tigers\, snakes and even a crocodile; there are also a few Muslim Theyyams (performed by Hindus). A Theyyakkaran must be able to sing\, dance\, play the chenda\, bless\, exorcise and be proficient in kalaripayattu\, Kerala’s martial art form since it is used in the rituals of the warrior heroes. Pepita Seth’s decades-long association with Theyyam’s practitioners gave her unprecedented access to their unique culture. In God’s Mirror: The Theyyams of Malabar is the culmination\, in her words and photographs\, of her commitment to this extraordinary subject. \nPepita Seth writes: “In God’s Mirror is the outcome of Theyyam’s practitioners suggesting I do a book about them. This was in order to establish that Theyyam is a ritual act during which devotees seek the blessings\, and even the help\, of the elaborately costumed deities. This was to dispense with the outside world always referring to Theyyam as a dance or a performance when in fact it is a sacred ritual in which men belonging to certain families have the ‘right’ to ‘carry’ a deity. Their only condition was that I stayed with them in order to know and understand their lives\, respect their multiple skills and realise what was important to them.”  \n“Although I was born in the UK and trained as a film editor\, it was the chance discovery of my soldier great-grandfather’s diary documenting his regiment’s 1857 march from Calcutta to Lucknow that took me to India. Yet despite going there in 1970 to retrace their long march\, I finally found another India in Kerala. And it was there that I eventually settled and began photographing and writing about the region’s unique culture.” \n

SUMMARY:Dvijottama
DESCRIPTION:\nDvijottama is the narrative of one of the greatest warriors of the Bharatha war – Drona. A man born to educate also finds the need to fight. What starts as a fight for survival ends for him on the battlefield of Kurukshetra\, losing everything he holds dear. His scruples\, his values\, and the love of his disciples. The play illustrates the conflict of choice each one of us faces in the battle for survival\, the choice of selecting the right action.\n\nThe play is a solo performance with an accomplished classical singer and a Bharatanatyam dancer. \nDvijottama premiered as Dvija at The Hindu Theatre Festival 2019 in Chennai\, and travelled to Bangalore to Swastika School of Dance and Music and was staged at the Sunday to Sunday Natarani Theatre Festival 2019 in Ahmedabad. Most recently it was performed as part of Kutty Kutcheri organised by Lasya Narasimhachari. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Ocean Connection
DESCRIPTION:35 mins | Kannada\, English with English Subtitles | India \nHonavar\, a coastal town mostly famous for pre-wedding shoots and great scenic routes\, a community full of men and women connected to fishing\, have been coming together to save the nesting grounds of the Schedule one species Olive Ridley Sea Turtles. The privatisation plans for the beach would lead to the nesting grounds being ruined thus the death of the next generation of sea turtles in the region. This is a heartwarming story of how humans bond with nature and also come together to protect it. \nIn 2010\, the Karnataka government identified a site for a proposed port on an estuary of the Sharavathi River in the town of Honnavar in Uttara Kannada district. Since then\, local residents of villages such as Tonka 1 and 2\, which are located on this sandspit of land known as Kasarkod have been protesting against the construction of the proposed port. Fisherfolk inhabit these picturesque seaside villages whose beaches are also a crucial Olive Ridley turtle nesting site. The residents and environmentalists state that the port would destroy this crucial turtle nesting site in coastal Karnataka. The annual nesting patterns of the Olive Ridley turtles are closely followed by the local fishing community and a pooja is also conducted when the hatchlings head to the sea. \nLocals also contend that the port would destroy their livelihood as it would have an impact on fishing. As it is\, the dry fishing industry which used the land now taken over by the port authorities\, has already stopped functioning. Another concern cited by environmentalists is that the estuary is situated on an unstable piece of land that is prone to erosion which would make it unusable for a port. Activists also claim that the building of a port would also mean the laying of a four-lane road that passes through these villages which are a breach of Coastal Regulation Zone norms. The fisherfolk’s opposition to the port has also led to instances over the past few years when protestors have been arrested by the district authorities. While their protests so far have not been successful\, villagers have vowed to continue their battle till all the legal routes have been exhausted. \nThe screening of the documentary will be followed by a panel discussion with the filmmaker\, Vikas Badiger\, Sandeep Hegde of the Honavar Foundation and fisherman\, Rajesh Govind Tandel\, moderated by journalist\, Vikhar Ahmad. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:ಪಂಚಮ ಪದ | Panchama Pada
DESCRIPTION:Panchama was a magazine closely aligned with the Dalit Movement in Karnataka that gave voice to a generation of writers and journalists to document their contemporary moment including atrocities against Dalits. Using performance\, the Jangama Collective revisits some of these writings and places them alongside songs\, skits\, pamphlets\, and their own memories to think about where one should look for an embodied archive of Dalit resistance.\n\nThere will be a twenty minute post performance open forum with the performers and audience.\n\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Vara Narada
DESCRIPTION:Typically considered to be a mischief maker\, the role of Narada has often been reduced to that of jest\, featuring as a comic relief in mythological stories. However\, there is far more depth to his character\, as evident in Sanskrit and regional literature. \nHe is a guru\, a well wisher and a soul that helps devotees in distress and more. His persona far surpasses the stereotypes that surround him\, and this production by Madrasana aims to highlight that. Presented by Vinay Varanasi & Aditya Madhavan\, Vara Narada pays homage to lesser known aspects of the bard through stories and music. The program aims to unravel the layers behind the character\, while traversing through stories and supporting music. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Towards Digital Film Societies
DESCRIPTION:Two years of Covid witnessed the world going digital in a big way. The analogue era’s cultural movements like film societies too underwent major changes. Many used digital platforms to see and discuss films in their quest towards building a better film culture. \nAfter starting as the only forum for savouring world film classics in 1940s Mumbai\, today the film society movement is finding itself in the midst of a complete digital makeover after two decades of struggling with digital formats from VHS tapes to OTT. Will these changes help them achieve their original goal of developing a group of film connoisseurs and professionals who will carry on the mantle of meaningful films? To know the future one needs to understand the history and its dynamics in full measure. \nBased on the book Celluloid to Digital: India’s Film Society Movement by V K Cherian\, this session will examine the future course of the Indian film society movement\, which nourished the ‘New Wave’ in Indian films from 1970 and has been an anchor for all the meaningful films in the country. \n

SUMMARY:Like the Date Palm
DESCRIPTION:“Translation is a little like falling in love\,” says Arvind Krishna Mehrotra. “It can be love at first sight\, when you read a poet and have a desire to translate him immediately. Or he can come back to you decades later\, your memory of him faded. When I started translating Rahim’s dohas\, I had forgotten all about him\, even who he was. It’s as if I’d never read him – though I had.” \nIn Search of Rahim is Mehrotra’s discovery of the man and his work through translation\, history\, and memory. In the process\, he recovers parts of his own boyhood by going back to someone who died 400 years ago. \nThis evening has Mehrotra in conversation with Jeet Thayil. \nHeader Image: Akbar’s siege of “Brampore” (Burhanpur); from the last German edition of *Munster’s Cosmographia*\, 1628 \n

SUMMARY:Echoes of AI
DESCRIPTION:On the surface\, an Indian doctor\, a British poet\, an UberEats courier in Pittsburgh\, and a Chinese activist in exile have nothing in common. But they are in fact linked by a profound common experience―unexpected encounters with artificial intelligence. In her debut book Code Dependent\, shortlisted for the Women’s Prize for Non-fiction\, Madhumita Murgia shows how automated systems are reshaping our lives all over the world\, from technology that marks children as future criminals\, to an app that is helping to offer medical diagnoses to a remote tribal community. \nAI has already infiltrated our day-to-day\, through language-generating chatbots like ChatGPT and social media. But it’s also affecting us in more insidious ways. It touches everything from our interpersonal relationships\, to our kids’ education\, work\, finances\, public services\, and even our human rights. \nBy highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley\, Madhumita explores the impact of this often-exploitative technology on individuals\, communities\, and our wider society. She exposes how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency\, and shatter our illusion of free will. AI is already changing what it means to be human\, in ways large and small\, and this book reveals what could happen if we fail to reclaim our humanity. \nMadhumita will be in conversation with lawyer\, Vidushi Marda. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Asamana Anasuya
DESCRIPTION:92 Minutes 36 Seconds | English & Telugu with English Subtitles | 2023 \nAsamana Anasuya (Incomparable Anasuya)\, is a documentary directed by Seetha Ratnakar as a tribute to her mother Vinjamuri Anasuya Devi.  \nVinjamuri Anasuya Devi was a musical prodigy who started giving concerts at the age of 7. Her first gramophone recording\, Ayyo Koyyoda at age 8\, ignited her lifelong love affair with folk music. She was a trailblazer who introduced folk songs on a concert platform when she was 11. Encouraged by the overwhelming response she started giving full length folk concerts along with her sister\, Vinjamuri Seetha Devi. Popularly known as the Vinjamuri Sisters\, they became a phenomenon that took the music world by storm.  \nAnasuya started composing music for her uncle\, Devulapalli Krishna Sastri when she was 9 and became a sought-after music composer. She was multi-talented and excelled in music of every genre but folk music remained her passion. She dedicated her life to popularising and propagating traditional and folk songs. She bequeathed an invaluable legacy to posterity by categorising her vast collection into 7 volumes and publishing them along with lyrics and music notations. At the age of 80\, Anasuya became a writer and published 4 books including her autobiography Asamana Anasuya\, at the age of 94.  \nThe film screening will be followed by a conversation with the director and a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:The Rise and Fall of the Vanderbilts
DESCRIPTION:Once upon a time\, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations\, the wealth-worth billions in today’s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change – the emotional and the rational – and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business\, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture\, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change—something prevalent in today’s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away. The authors will share their insight on how it’s imperative to draw lessons from the past\, navigate the present\, and prepare for the future. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n
