SUMMARY:396. Sama\, Dana\, Danda\, Bheda: Friends\, Rivals\, or Just Trading Partners?
DESCRIPTION:Trust is thin\, history is long\, and the consequences? Unforgiving. \nIndia and China share a long border and a longer shadow. Security risks and market hopes pull in opposite directions. In a world of shifting power\, India must choose with care. \nThis evening explores that choice through the ancient philosophical and logical Indian discipline of Purva Paksha. \nEach speaker first presents the other’s case\, fully and fairly\, before offering their own. The aim isn’t to score points\, but rather\, to see clearly: where trust frayed\, where interests align\, and where wisdom might guide policy. \nExpect a rigorous\, humane conversation that values nuance over noise\, and context over heat. If you’ve wondered how India can guard its borders while growing its future\, this format offers you a chance to learn through respectful debate. \nFor those who prize thoughtfulness\, this is a rare chance! \nIn collaboration with: \n \nIn this episode of BIC Talks\, Manoj Kewalramani will be in conversation with Pranay Kotasthane. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in Sep 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favourite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere\, including Apple Podcasts\, Spotify\, Google Podcasts\, Castbox\, Overcast\, Audible\, and Amazon Music. \n

SUMMARY:Tales of Longing: Stories of Love and Restraint
DESCRIPTION:Love unfolds in countless shades\, and dance is its most eloquent witness! \nPallavi frames the journey with invocations to Shiva\, the cosmic dancer whose eternal rhythm anchors all experience. Between these moments\, a trio of evocative episodes unfolds: a heroine confiding in her friend about the king she longs for\, a courtesan challenging her lover’s hollow assurances\, and a wife embracing one final night with her husband before he departs for war. Each vignette reveals how love moves through vulnerability\, desire\, frustration\, and devotion. \nThis performance features Raghuram Rajagopalan on vocals\, Vinay Nagarajan on mridangam\, Mathur R. Srinidhi on violin\, and Sahana Sridhar leading the Nattuvangam. With a distinguished live ensemble supporting her\, Pallavi offers an intimate exploration of love’s many textures.  \nAn evening that lingers like a feeling you recognise before you can name. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Kaleidoscope
DESCRIPTION:A tradition stays alive not by preservation alone\, but by the courage to reimagine. \nThis concert pays homage to the Hindustani classical musicians of the 20th century: artists who honoured an ancient lineage while boldly reshaping it for a changing world. As India awakened to independence\, they too evolved with it\, expanding melodic possibilities\, reimagining rhythm\, and infusing contemporary thought into timeless ragas. Legends such as Pt. Dinkar Kaikini\, Pt. Kumar Gandharva\, Vid. Prabha Atre\, Vid. Veena Sahasrabuddhe\, Begum Akhtar\, and Farida Khanum helped forge a modern\, resonant Hindustani idiom whose influence endures today. \nMaahi and Neil revisit this rich inheritance through ragas like Yaman Kalyan\, Bihag\, Multani\, and Bhairavi\, alongside select semi-classical pieces. Both artistes will present vocal works. Maahi will be accompanied by Neil on the Appalachian dulcimer\, while Neil’s performance will feature Aniket on classical electric guitar. Kaushik will provide the rhythmic accompaniment on tabla for both. \nAn evening to honour the musicians who made this music timeless. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:My Guru\, My Art
DESCRIPTION:This edition of My Guru\, My Art offers a distinctive lens on legacy. While the life and work of Vidushi Lalith J Rao are traced through the voices and performances of her students\, a personal perspective is brought in by her husband\, Shri N. Jayavanth Rao\, who will be present on her behalf. The performances will be accompanied by Surya Upadhya on the harmonium and Yogeesh Bhat on the tabla. Through a careful weaving of conversation and live music\, the programme reflects on Vidhushi Lalithji’s journey from early training in Bengaluru to her stature as a leading torchbearer of the Agra–Atrauli Gharana\, and on the values she shaped and passed on. Curated and scripted by Manohar Patwardhan and Tara Kini\, the evening is both a tribute and a heartfelt celebration of a luminous journey. \nThe Guru-Shishya parampara has been integral to the learning of Indian classical dance and music art forms: a deeply immersive and rigorous tradition that holds its own even in the modern context. A profound emotional and spiritual bond forms between teacher and student\, through which not just the practice and knowledge of art\, but also a way of life is transmitted down the generations. The Guru goes beyond the imparting of technicalities and nuances of art to shape and hone the Shishya’s voice\, indeed\, the artistic identity. The Shishya\, part of a lineage that connects to the Guru’s Gurus\, links the past with the future\, carrying this tradition to a new generation of artistes and audiences. \nThis series\, My Guru\, My Art  takes an intimate look at this tradition and hopes to capture for posterity the stories of how the magic is created. In these sessions artistes explore personal histories of learning a classical art form\, sharing memories of interactions with their teachers\, inspirations\, influences\, anecdotes of compositions and teaching moments\, punctuated by music to illustrate the stories. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Land of the Blackbuck: A Story of Hope and Resilience
DESCRIPTION:23 minutes | English | 2025 | India \nWhen we decide what is worth protecting\, who gets left behind? \nLand of the Blackbuck turns its gaze toward India’s grasslands: vast\, open ecosystems long dismissed as “wastelands\,” and quietly pushed to the margins of conservation thought. This documentary reveals the cost of this misnaming. Not only is the survival of species such as the blackbuck\, caracal\, and great Indian bustard at risk\, but also a deeper understanding of how life persists in these seemingly spare terrains. \nMoving beyond wildlife portraiture\, the film traces the intricate web of life sustained by grasslands\, weaving together ecological science\, lived knowledge\, and cultural memory. Through voices of local communities\, researchers\, and conservationists\, it challenges the hierarchy of what is deemed worthy of care\, asking what happens when we fail to protect what is not glorified. \nThis film is a mark of the wider movement calling for attention\, humility\, and responsibility toward ecosystems that quietly sustain us all. \nThe screening is followed by a conversation with filmmaker Sumanth Kuduvalli and behavioural ecologist Kavita Isvaran\, concluding with an audience Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:Love on the Run
DESCRIPTION:How far would you go for love? \nIn this session author Madhavi Mahadevan and Lakshmi Sankar explore elopement; an act often romanticized but rooted in complex societal conflict. Joining the discussion are speakers from varied backgrounds: a classical dancer who interprets myths through movement\, a storyteller who uncovers mythology in India’s living traditions and a legal expert who grounds these narratives in present-day realities. \nThe conversation will trace how mythology shapes our understanding of love and rebellion. From classic texts to contemporary cinema\, from mainstream retellings to folk traditions\, whose voices get prioritized? How do different modes of storytelling influence what we consider acceptable defiance? And did earlier societies view elopement as a legitimate response when love collided with social expectations\, or has our romanticization of it obscured more complex truths? \nAn evening that moves between myth and modernity\, romance and reality. \n

SUMMARY:Biscuits\, Samosas and a Fork\, Please
DESCRIPTION:Turning the ordinary into the extraordinary! \nIn this playful\, interactive session\, children set off on a lively treasure hunt through the BIC Library\, discovering how everyday objects can hide extraordinary stories. With clues\, riddles\, and a round of object-themed Dumb Charades\, young explorers search for familiar items—a pencil here\, a mysterious “kick-me” object there—and uncover how these simple things travelled across continents through collaboration\, curiosity\, and centuries of shared ideas. \nClues tucked inside books lead the way\, revealing how common tools found their path to India and into daily life. As the hunt unfolds\, the library itself becomes a map of hidden histories. \nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins\, not with a ticket\, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion\, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet\, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday\, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return\, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books\, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Things I Know to Be True
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the story parents tell themselves begins to unravel? \nThings I Know to Be True opens inside a household that appears settled\, successful\, and certain of its own choices. The parents believe they have raised four responsible\, self-sufficient children. Yet\, as the family gathers and life quietly intervenes\, that confidence begins to fracture. Each child stands at a turning point (some comic\, some devastating) forcing the family to confront what growing up truly costs\, and what letting go really means. \nWritten by Australian playwright Andrew Bovell and directed by Delhi-based veteran theatre-maker Feisal Alkazi\, the play traces the intimate tremors beneath everyday life: marriages that settle into routine\, careers that falter\, identities that refuse to stay hidden\, and parents learning (often painfully) that love cannot protect against every fall. With deeply universal themes\, the play has resonated across continents\, becoming one of the world’s most performed scripts in recent years. \nFamiliar lives\, difficult choices\, and the tender ache of watching those we love grow in unexpected ways. \nProduced in arrangement with Nick Hern Books \n\n\nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Vishnu-Davis-Haleigh Project
DESCRIPTION:Crossing genres and geographies\, this performance is truly unique. \nThe Vishnu\, Davis & Haleigh project is a genre-defying crossover that brings together the richness of Indian ragas and rhythms with the expansiveness of American folk and jazz harmony into a shared soundscape. This collaboration began as a musical conversation across distance: between Appalachian folk traditions rooted in storytelling\, the improvisational language of jazz\, and the raga-based imagination of Indian classical music. \nDavis & Haleigh\, a violin and acoustic guitar duo from Birmingham\, Alabama\, come together with Bengaluru-based Carnatic fusion artist Vishnu R—an award-winning performer and inventor of the Navtar—to explore what happens when distinct musical lineages meet without hierarchy\, and with curiosity leading the way. Bridging traditions of the East and the West\, the trio seamlessly blends Carnatic\, folk\, jazz\, and blues\, bringing centuries-old traditions into dialogue with innovative modern artistry. \nAt the heart of the performance is dialogue: between strings and rhythm\, structure and spontaneity\, memory and invention. Davis & Haleigh’s intricate interplay is woven into Vishnu’s explorations on the Navtar\, his self-designed nine-string instrument that merges fretted\, fretless\, and harp-like textures. Fresh from a US tour\, this India and Southeast Asia debut carries music shaped by travel\, trust\, and attentive listening. \nGenres blur\, and geographies dissolve\, as music takes on a new form. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Raag Anuraag
DESCRIPTION:Raag Anuraag opens into an evening of khayal gayakee shaped by the quiet eloquence of the Rampur–Sahaswan tradition. Known for its unhurried pace and lyrical clarity\, this gharana values feeling over flourish\, allowing melody to travel in long\, graceful arcs. Each phrase is carefully placed\, each turn of the raag revealed with patience\, creating a sound world that is poised\, reflective\, and deeply attentive to nuance. \nHere\, taan and tarana are not displays of speed but acts of expression. Taan flows like extended sentences: supple\, voice-led\, and melodic. Tarana unfolds as song rather than spectacle\, its syllables shaped for balance and resonance. The music lingers\, listens\, and slowly opens outward\, inviting the raag to show its many shades. \nA contemplative experience of khayal from a unique tradition. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Gail and Bharat
DESCRIPTION:80 minutes | English & Marathi with English subtitles | India | 2025 \nScholarship and resistance bridged by love. \nA documentary that traces the shared journey of US-born Indian sociologist and Dalit rights activist Dr. Gail Omvedt and activist-intellectual Dr. Bharat Patankar\, this film situates their personal story within the larger arc of India’s socio-political movements. Charting Omvedt’s path from America to western Maharashtra\, her deep engagement with Dalit-Bahujan politics\, and a life of thought and action shaped alongside Patankar\, Gail & Bharat brings out the personal in the political. \nSet largely in Kasegaon\, where the couple lived and worked for decades\, the film foregrounds voices and struggles long ignored by mainstream media and academia. It reflects Omvedt’s seminal contributions to anti-caste studies and her role in building global intellectual conversations around Phule and Ambedkar\, while also capturing Patankar’s grassroots leadership through movements for land\, water\, and dignity. Tender\, political\, and quietly moving\, the documentary preserves the legacy of two organic intellectuals whose lives blurred the boundaries between scholarship\, activism\, and everyday care. \nThe screening will be followed by a conversation between filmmaker Somnath Waghmare and investigative journalist Sudipto Mondal\, and will subsequently conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Nritya Naad
DESCRIPTION:Can a dancer hold rhythm in her feet\, melody in her voice\, and an instrument in her hands? \nThis performance brings Indian classical dance\, music\, and rhythm into conversation. Rooted in Kathak and reaching across vocals\, sitar and tabla\, the production traces how movement\, melody\, and taal speak to one another: not as separate disciplines\, but rather\, as interwoven modes of expression. \nThe performance features a rare Kathak Yoga segment\, where the dancer sings the rhythmic cycle\, plays an instrument\, and dances complex mathematical patterns simultaneously. It also ventures into a 5½-beat cycle\, an unusual rhythmic inquiry\, followed by an unconventional jugalbandi that draws the entire musical ensemble into spontaneous dialogue with the dance.  \nThe evening unfolds a porous performance space where roles blur and expression travels freely between body\, voice\, and rhythm.  \nSupported by:\n \n  \n

SUMMARY:The Trial that Shook Britain
DESCRIPTION:A courtroom drama that shook an empire. \nIn 1945\, three Indian National Army officers stood trial for treason against the British Crown. Shah Nawaz Khan\, Prem Sahgal and Gurbaksh Dhillon were convicted. Then something unexpected happened; events that would accelerate the transfer of power and expose cracks in both British authority and Congress strategy. While Congress built its reputation on passive resistance\, at this critical moment it applauded and capitalized on the INA’s use of force. What does this contradiction reveal about the final phase of India’s independence struggle? How did a legal proceeding meant to assert British control instead demonstrate its fragility? \nAshis Ray will discuss his latest book\, The Trial that Shook Britain\, which uncovers how this court martial became a catalyst for independence. Ray’s research unearths material that historians have largely overlooked\, throwing new light on a decisive juncture where courtroom drama became political dynamite. Following the talk\, Ray will be in conversation with Siddharth Raja.  \nThe session concludes with a Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:A Timeless Musical Journey
DESCRIPTION:Three instruments. Three eras. One continuous string of sound. \nThis lecture–demonstration traces the surprising history of the Rudra Veena\, Surbahar\, and Sitar: three string instruments that shaped the imagination of Indian classical music across centuries. Moving from the deep\, contemplative resonance of early traditions to the expressive possibilities of modern forms\, the session reveals how design\, repertoire\, and aesthetics evolved alongside changing musical worlds. \nGuiding this journey is Dr. Jayant Kumar Das\, among the very few artists in India proficient in all three instruments\, and an A-graded All India Radio artiste on each. Through carefully chosen demonstrations and reflective conversation\, he evokes the musical philosophies surrounding these strings\, from the gravity of Dhrupad to the subtle refinements of Khayal. Joining him are Abhijit Sarkar on pakhawaj\, Mihir Kallianpur on tabla\, Sashikala Bhat on vocals\, and C. Shivashankar on tanpura. \nA listening space where history speaks through sound\, and tradition reveals itself anew. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Being and Becoming: Writing the Memoir of a Transman
DESCRIPTION:Sunil Mohan’s memoir is a deeply reflective account of transition that moves beyond the familiar arc of before-and-after. Writing with honesty and quiet courage\, Mohan traces a lifelong knowing of self alongside a persistent questioning of gender\, masculinity\, and belonging. As he transitions from being read as female to male\, the book resists easy definitions\, asking how one might claim manhood without surrendering to narrow\, socially sanctioned models of masculinity. \nRather than centring pain alone\, the narrative turns outward: to the queer\, trans\, anti-caste\, feminist\, and people’s movements that have shaped Mohan’s political and emotional world. It reflects on friendship\, resistance\, silence\, healing\, and the strength found in sharing our struggle. \nIn this conversation\, Sunil Mohan will be joined by contemporary inventive Dalit writer Dr Gogu Shyamala and Assistant Professor at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit\, Reshma Bharadwaj to reflect on the book’s themes\, the politics of becoming\, and the quiet pride of living with integrity. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n
