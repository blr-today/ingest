SUMMARY:Wolves of the Deccan
DESCRIPTION:Older than the Himalayas\, the Deccan is the oldest geological formation of the Indian subcontinent. Endemic species\, some found nowhere else on earth\, once inhabited this landscape\, teeming with wildlife. Gently undulating plains of endless grasslands and savannah\, rocky thorn and scrub jungles\, and riverine and riparian ecosystems\, were rich with an amazing biodiversity of flora and fauna. Tigers roamed and Asiatic Cheetah hunted Black Buck in high-speed chases across the plains. From Dung Beetles to Sloth Bears\, from the Great Indian Bustard to Caracals\, from millions of migratory birds arriving in winter\, to wild flora rich with life-giving sustenance\, this was the Deccan. From the unbearable heat of summer\, to the welcome monsoons\, the land was vibrant. From cool winters to a short spring\, culture and nature tell stories of millions of years of evolution.  \nFast forward to today\, and the reality of the effects of unsustainable development. Loss of habitat\, rampant illegal wildlife trade\, roadkill\, conflict with the grassroots level stakeholders\, have all taken a heavy toll. We have lost most of our pristine wilderness and over half of our flora and fauna. \nThis presentation will take the audience through a view of the past\, present and future of the Deccan landscape. It will include the work of the Deccan Conservation Foundation as para ecologists\, preserving\, protecting and conserving the last remaining isolated\, unprotected habitats and wilderness\, with a focus on the Indian Wolf\, the apex predator\, and other associated species. \nImage Credit: All photos by Indrajeet Ghorpade. \nPresented by the Deccan Conservation Foundation. \n \n

SUMMARY:Prabodhan - An Awakening
DESCRIPTION:Prabodhan – an awakening is an intimate offering of dance compositions that reflect and reveal the artist’s inner world. Each piece in this journey is a doorway to deeper presence and transformation—an awakening of the senses\, the spirit\, and the social conscience. \nThe performance opens with Madurapuri Chokkar Kauvuthuvam\, a celebration of Śiva’s splendor. In Rāvaṇa – the dot that moved\, the lens turns to Rāvaṇa—not as a demon\, but as a devotee whose fierce love evokes Śiva’s grace\, uncovering a powerful and unexpected reciprocity. \nIn Ganga\, ecological and personal histories entwine. It becomes a meditation on legacy—on what we inherit and what we pass on. This is an awakening to responsibility and the urgent need for care. \nThe final piece\, Chakra Alarippu\, brings the journey to alignment. It is a dance of balance—between breath and movement\, the self and the cosmos. \nThis is not performance as display\, but a quiet turning toward presence—a call to awaken. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:First Movers in ‘Second Life’ Start-Ups
DESCRIPTION:When it comes to climate change and the environment\, they are part of  the problem and part of the solution – Plastics and Lithium-ion. \nWe cannot ignore the role these materials play in today’s world. They have revolutionized many industries even while they have been the cause of negative ecological and social impacts. Mainly because their end-of-life management remains a significant global challenge. Is it possible to bring them into the circular economy in positive and equitable ways? \nThis discussion is with three innovative companies that not just think so\, they also walk the talk. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nPresented by: \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Huliyappa – A Retelling
DESCRIPTION:15 minutes | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 | India \nHuliyappa is a short documentary in Kannada by first-time filmmaker\, Sourabha Rao. Shot entirely in the remote hamlets of the Uttara Kannada district\, the film is centred around an ancient custom of worshipping the eponymous tiger deity during Deepavali\, for the protection of people and their livestock from large Carnivora – tigers\, leopards and bears. \nThe film reveals the losses faced by the residents of this thickly forested Western Ghats landscape to themselves and their prized cattle due to incidents with wildlife\, and the surprising tolerance\, forgiveness and compassion that prevail in people despite them. It is an exploration of the mythical\, emotional and rational origins of the remarkable faith. Through conversations with people from various strata of the local society\, including scholars\, farmers and cowherds\, Rao makes a concise and compelling retelling of a culture that has maintained the unlikeliest harmony between humans and wildlife in the region for centuries\, and documents the simple rituals that constitute it. \nRather soberingly\, Huliyappa is also a timely reminder of the dire need to impress such indigenous practices upon a generation increasingly disconnected from its roots\, if the equilibrium with Nature\, so pivotal to the future of humanity\, is to be vouchsafed. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with the team that made the film\, in conversation with Sonu Venugopal. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis screening is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Bound by Soil: A Requiem for the Forgotten
DESCRIPTION:Inspired by ONV Kurup’s evocative Malayalam poem Bhoomikaorru Charmageetham\, a requiem to the Earth\, this production mournfully echoes the planet’s anguish as it witnesses the destruction of its progeny and the desecration of its sacred body. Drawing from ancient myths of forests sacrificed for the march of civilization to the modern plundering of natural resources\, the narrative weaves a searing commentary on humanity’s parasitic progression. It lays bare the devastating impact of ecological imbalance\, exposing how the relentless pursuit of growth comes at the expense of both nature and the lives of marginalized communities that remain intimately bound to it. \nThis performance is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparabl \n
