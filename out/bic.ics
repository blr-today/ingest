SUMMARY:Gandhi
DESCRIPTION:Can dance translate the restlessness of a conscience\, the weight of compassion? \nWith Gandhi\, choreographer C P Satyajit reimagines the Mahatma’s life and philosophy through the timeless language of Bharatanatyam. This is not a chronological retelling\, but a meditation on his ideals: his restless pursuit of truth\, his unwavering sense of justice\, his profound connection with people. \nThrough delicate abhinaya and layered rhythmic improvisations\, the production traces Gandhi’s journey as both a leader and a seeker. Informed by the research of Dr. V R Devika\, whose PhD explored Gandhi’s communication strategies\, the work captures how his ideals might continue to move us\, literally and metaphorically\, today.\n\nIn this unique performance\, every gesture is a reminder that truth and compassion remain unfinished tasks. \nCredits:\nConcept & Choreography: C P Satyajit \nDancers:\nKeerthana Ganesan\nDevikha S\nHemavathy Kalaiarasan\nParvathi Parameswar\nArchana Sivasubramanian\nAnjannaa Ashok \nMusicians\nM S Sukhi: Rhythm\nMonali Bala: Voice\nManonmani T: Sarangi \nOriginal Lighting Design: Martin Jose\nOperated by: Muthukumar R \nThe production is created by Bharata Kalanjali with the support of the Kaladham Trust and Sarvodaya International\, Karnataka. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n  \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Adventures in Friendship
DESCRIPTION:Step into a world where stories come alive! \nIn this fun and playful workshop\, kids (ages 8–12) and their parents get to explore friendship through three wonderful tales: The Musicians of Bremen\, Krishna and Sudama\, and The Monkey and the Crocodile. \nTogether\, we’ll jump into the roles of these memorable characters\, improvising new meanings and alternative endings\, while joyfully navigating friendship’s adventures\, challenges\, and deeper meanings. \nExpect laughter\, noise\, creativity\, and quiet reflections as we discover how stories—and friendship—can shine brighter when shared.\nTwo magical hours of story\, play\, and togetherness! \nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins\, not with a ticket\, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion\, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet\, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday\, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return\, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books\, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \nIn collaboration with:\n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Celestial Dance
DESCRIPTION:Can ancient astronomy teach us how to measure both a second and a trillion years? \nIn this special session\, astronomy enthusiast S Kishore Kumar brings the ancient Indian Panchanga (the Hindu calendar) alive through modern Stellarium software. Celestial movements unfold as vivid animations\, making complex ideas simple and visual. Participants will learn the meaning of terms like Masa\, Paksha\, Tithi\, and Nakshatra\, and discover why festivals shift dates each year\, why zodiac signs number twelve\, and why cosmic rhythms still shape our daily lives. \nThe Panchanga is more than an almanac; it is a scientific framework linking human life to the cosmos. For over 1\,500 years Indian astronomy thrived\, reaching a peak in Vijayanagar and Kerala\, charting planetary motions with astonishing precision. Texts like the Surya Siddhanta imagined time on scales from a fleeting breath (prana) to a cosmic cycle (parardha) spanning 155.52 trillion years. \nThrough a blend of science and storytelling\, S. Kishore Kumar reveals how this timeless tradition connects us to the universe.  \nStep in\, and witness time unfold! \nPresented by:\n \nSupported by:\n  \n

SUMMARY:Artie’s Festival India
DESCRIPTION:Join us for an evening of timeless music spanning the Classical\, Romantic\, and operatic traditions. \nThe program opens with Mozart’s Sonata for Violin and Piano K. 379\, followed by two highlights from Handel’s Giulio Cesare in Egitto: the stately “Ouverture” and the aria “Piangerò la sorte mia.” Three elegant songs by Reynaldo Hahn—Décrets indolents du hasard\, L’heure exquise\, and La dernière valse—close the first half. \nAfter the interval\, Schubert’s expansive Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat major\, Op. 99 takes center stage\, before the concert ends on a lighthearted note with Offenbach’s witty operetta numbers: Ah que j’aime les militaires and Tu n’es pas riche\, tu n’es pas beau. \nA program of contrasts—poised and playful\, intimate and grand—this evening offers a journey through some of Europe’s most beloved musical voices. \nPresented by: \n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Magdalana Mariam
DESCRIPTION:\nWhat awakens within us when temptation gives way to truth? \nThis performance in chaste Malayalam brings to life Mahakavi Vallathol Menon’s lyrical poem Magdalana Mariam through the timeless vocabulary of Bharatanatyam. The poem narrates the story of Mariam\, a woman who rises from poverty to wealth\, only to find herself ensnared by pride and desire. One night\, a moment of stark realization shatters her illusions\, revealing the emptiness of her existence. \nHer encounter with Christ transforms this despair into redemption\, and it is this very arc from vanity to awakening\, that unfolds on stage. Through evocative abhinaya\, intricate rhythm\, and the expressive power of Bharatanatyam\, the performance turns Vallathol’s poetry into a moving meditation on the possibility of renewal. \nA story of loss\, grace\, and transformation\, waiting to be felt through movement and verse! \n \n \nCredits: \nMusic: Dr. O.S. Arun \nConcept & Choreography: Anjana Anand \nLighting Design: Sneha Sheejith \n \n \n\nSupported by: \n \n\n  \n\n

SUMMARY:Romantic Visions: Scriabin\, Liszt\, and Chopin
DESCRIPTION:Hailed by CBC Music as one of Canada’s finest young musicians\, pianist Tony Yike Yang first captured international attention at just sixteen\, when he became the youngest-ever laureate of the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw. Since then\, he has appeared in some of the world’s leading concert halls\, from Carnegie Hall and the Tokyo Metropolitan Theatre to the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory\, performing with major orchestras including the Cleveland Orchestra\, Warsaw Philharmonic\, and Orchestre Métropolitain. \nThis evening\, he presents a programme that traces a sweeping arc through the Romantic imagination. Scriabin’s early Preludes open the program alongside his rarely heard Fantasy in B minor. Liszt follows with two contrasting masterpieces: the intimate Sonetto 104 del Petrarca\, and the dazzling Mephisto Waltz No. 1\, one of Liszt’s most iconic showpieces. The program culminates in Chopin’s Sonata in B minor. Together\, these works highlight the Romantic piano’s full expressive range\, brought to life by Tony Yike Yang’s artistry. \n \nSupported by: \n    \n

SUMMARY:ಸಂಗಮ | Sangama | Coming Together
DESCRIPTION:67 minutes | Kannada\, English and Hindi with English subtitles | Germany\, India | 2025 \nOn January 22\, 2024\, much of India came to a halt as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a grand temple to Lord Ram\, built on the contested site of a demolished mosque. The spectacle\, meticulously staged\, gave the ruling party a decisive advantage ahead of the 2024 Indian elections\, further splintering an already divided opposition. \nSangama is a powerful portrait of democracy at work in Southern India. The film follows the campaign of Wake-up Karnataka (WK)\, a citizen-led coalition mobilizing national networks to challenge the decade-long dominance of the BJP. \nJourneying with Team WK\, by train\, car\, and on foot\, the film captures their efforts to steer clear of polarizing rhetoric and instead spotlight urgent\, everyday issues: unemployment\, farmer distress\, and the rising cost of essentials. “Our tradition has taught us to love and not hate\,” one senior member affirms\, encapsulating their ethos. \nFrom intimate community meetings and voter registration drives to the energy of massive political rallies\, an intricate mosaic of the Indian election unfolds. Voices from the ground echo the people’s concerns: “Modi may have done a lot for the rich\, but daily wagers haven’t benefited at all.” \nAs the summer intensifies\, so do the campaigns—and with them\, caste-based clashes stirred by political forces. Meanwhile\, the Prime Minister amplifies anti-Muslim rhetoric\, unsettled that strident Hindu nationalism is losing its appeal. Protests demanding accountability from pliant election officials expose the unevenness of the playing field. Through it all\, Team WK persists\, moving village to village\, booth to booth\, ensuring that people cast their votes. \nCommissioned by the Centre for Modern Indian Studies\, Göttingen\, Germany\, the film is part of Election Diaries 2024\, a series of nine campaigns across India that celebrate the resilience of democracy. At a time when authoritarian regimes are on the rise and narrow visions of nationhood threaten to erase cultural plurality\, Sangama reminds us that an alternative vision of collective resistance and unity endures. \nThe screening will be followed by an interactive discussion with Tara Rao\, Noor Sridhar and Mallige Sirimane from Eddelu Karnataka\, and filmmaker Sunanda Bhat. The session\, moderated by Pooja Prasanna\, will conclude with a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Samyoga – Khayal Se Kriti Tak
DESCRIPTION:Shared roots\, divergent paths: listen as tradition and expression entwine! \nSamyoga brings together Hindustani and Carnatic music in a rare exploration of sound\, emotion\, and tradition.

SUMMARY:Sovereigns of the Sea: Omani Ambition in the Age of Empire
DESCRIPTION:This talk based on the book\, Sovereigns of the Sea. Omani ambition in the age of Empire\, views the Indian Ocean as an important political space where both Asian and Western imperial aspirations were articulated in the long nineteenth century. Putting the micro-optic on the Omani Sultans\, rather than on European powers\, it questions the idea that the Ocean became an uncontested British lake in the age of Empire. It shows how the Sultans made the most of Europeans who made a bee line to the Western Indian Ocean hungry for slaves\, cloves\, and ivory. They leveraged themselves to European economic concerns and politics\, but remained heeled in their own cultural tradition. Many of them reached out to Indian financiers and merchants and articulated clearly their political ambitions. The talk forefronts these Asian imperial ambitions in the Ocean with important implications for the writing of global histories. \nAbout Prof. Satish Chandra \nProf. Satish Chandra (1922 – 2017) was a leading authority on Medieval Indian History. \nIn a career spanning nearly 40 years\, Prof. Chandra taught history at Allahabad University\, Aligarh Muslim University\, Delhi University\, Rajasthan University\, and finally the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)\, where along with S. Gopal\, Bipin Chandra and Romila Thapar he co-founded the Centre for Historical Studies. \nIn between\, from 1972 to 1980 he was first Vice Chairman and then the Chairman of the University Grants Commission. \nIn 1985\, along with intellectuals like Prof. Nurul Hasan and marine biologist Dr. Zahoor Qasim\, he founded the Society for Indian Ocean Studies which\, among other activities\, brings out the quarterly Journal for Indian Ocean Studies. \nSon of Sir Sita Ram\, India’s first High Commissioner to Pakistan (1947-48)\, Prof. Chandra has\, along with some other JNU historians\, been said to have been a ‘left leaning historian’ who espoused the Marxist approach to history\, and one whose early experiences helped bridge the intellectual gap in interpreting medieval Indian history and modern times. \n

SUMMARY:Kutiyattam Balivadham
DESCRIPTION:When the curtain is removed we see Sugreeva sitting in a mood of deep sorrow and dejection. Sugreeva expresses through hand gestures and facial expression his agonies and his hardships on living alone in a solitary wood. \nSugreeva\, for fear of his elder brother Bali\, has taken refuge in the Malyavan Mountain. Hounded out of his palace\, Sugreeva bemoans his sad lot\, living alone in the forest facing the rigours of nature. He sees around him in the forest\, a reflection of his own mental state. “My good God\, will my miseries never end? Exposed to the sun\, drenched by the rains\, shivering in the cold and open to the winds\, I live in the forest. Would I ever see a normal comfortable life? He decides to take a leaf and tried to go deep into the issue. First he sees that there is no Friend but there is foe. At that time\, he sees a deer running away frightened hearing a hunter’s bow. On taking shelter in a cave\, it is frightened to see a lion in it. When he takes up the leaf and looks a second time\, he sees Friend and foe. In another angle\, he sees a snake hiding in a hole fearing Garuda flying in the sky. Then\, Hanuman comes and allies with him. Looking a third time\, he sees that he has Friend but there is no foe. In a direction\, a peacock dances seeing the dark clouds and a forest fire starts. Later he sees that it rains and the fire ends. Then\, seeing Rama and Lakshmana on the banks of the river Pamba\, he asks Hanuman\, Please go and find the truth behind it and kindly bring them here and make them join hands with me. Sugreeva sees Hanuman returning with Rama & Lakshmana .Here\, with the fire as witness\, the scene of Sugreeva making friends with Rama is acted out. Together with Rama\, Lakshmana\, and Hanuman\, Sugreeva returns to Kishkindha and boldly challenges Bali to battle \nOn the Stage:\nSugreeva: Nepathya Sreehari Chakyar\nMizhavu: Kalamandalam Manikandan\, Nepathya Jiensh\nEdakka: Kalanilayam Rajan\nThalam: Dr. Indu G.\nMake-up: Kalamandalam Satheesan\nTroupe: Nepathya\, Moozhikkulam \nThis is the seventh edition of the ‘All For Dance’ series presented by Kalavaahini in association with BIC curated by Malavika Sarukkai.

SUMMARY:Murta Maheswara
DESCRIPTION:In a world where we often connect with Lord Shiva through music\, dance\, and celebration\, the concept of Murta Maheswara offers a deeper understanding of this deity. It is a journey to find the essence of Shiva as a carefree\, uninhibited\, and truthful force within ourselves\, rather than through rigid doctrine. \nMurta Maheswara is explored through three key aspects of Shiva’s nature: \nPashupati: This highlights Shiva as the lord of all creatures\, a figure revered since ancient times. The seals of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro depict him surrounded by animals who trust him completely\, showing his connection to all beings—fierce and gentle alike. \nShiva-Shakti: This story explores the union of Shiva and Shakti. Shiva represents the passive\, foundational energy\, while Shakti is the active\, creative force. Their cosmic union is a symbol of harmony and regeneration\, a sacred bond that is mirrored in the union of man and woman. \nDhwani-Pratidhwani: This concept reveals the origin of sound through Shiva’s cosmic dance. When Shiva strikes his damaru\, he creates Dhwani\, the primordial sound. This sound then echoes throughout the cosmos as Pratidwani\, the manifestation of all audible sound. This illustrates that every sound we hear is part of the divine dance of Nataraja. \nSupported by; \n \n

SUMMARY:Navalny
DESCRIPTION:98 minutes | English\, Russian and German | 2022 \nEnthralling and intimate\, the Oscar-winning documentary Navalny\, directed by Daniel Roher\, unfolds with the pace of a thriller as it follows Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny in his quest to identify the men who poisoned him in August 2020. Shot in Germany as the story unfolded\, the film offers extraordinary access to the investigation while also portraying Navalny the man—a reformist leader who refuses to be cowed\, even by an assassination attempt. \nThe documentary takes viewers inside the meticulous investigation into the shocking poisoning\, revealing who was behind it. Navalny’s years-long campaign against corruption among Russia’s elites has earned him powerful enemies\, particularly Vladimir Putin\, who pointedly refuses to utter his name in public. In August 2020\, Navalny was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent in an elaborate attempt on his life. Despite official denials\, independent investigations by Bellingcat\, CNN\, and others later linked the attack to the Kremlin. \nThe film Navalny is produced by Odessa Rae (RaeFilm Studios)\, Diane Becker and Melanie Miller (Fishbowl Films)\, Shane Boris (Cottage M)\, and Amy Entelis and Courtney Sexton (CNN Films)\, with Maria Pevchikh as executive producer. \nFollowing the screening\, a discussion between Aakar Patel and Swati Dandekar will take place\, followed by an audience Q&A. \nPlease note: Director Daniel Roher will not be present. \nViewer discretion: Children under 17 are restricted from viewing the film unless accompanied by an adult. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Antarctica: A Journey in Photographs
DESCRIPTION:Step into one of the most remote and pristine places on Earth\, without leaving Bangalore. In this immersive session\, traveller\, photographer\, and storyteller Raksha Nagaraj takes you on an unforgettable journey to Antarctica through striking photographs and firsthand narratives of her expedition to the White Continent. \nThe talk reveals Antarctica’s awe-inspiring landscapes\, towering icebergs\, endless oceans\, and surreal stretches of ice that few have ever seen. But it goes beyond scenery. Raksha’s photographs capture extraordinary encounters with wildlife: playful penguins\, curious seals\, and majestic whales\, each image paired with stories that bring their behaviour to life in this extreme environment. \nAdding a scientific dimension\, Raksha shares her experience participating in a Citizen Science program\, where travellers assisted researchers by collecting plankton samples\, studying fjord freshwater impact on seawater\, and recording data critical to understanding climate change. These efforts highlight how exploration can meaningfully contribute to global research. Part personal narrative\, part visual adventure\, this session blends exploration\, adventure\, science\, and storytelling. It reflects the wonder of standing at the edge of the world and the urgency of protecting such fragile ecosystems in a rapidly changing climate. \nJoin us for an evening of discovery\, photography\, and conversation\, and see Antarctica as few have ever experienced it. Irrespective of whether you are an adventurer\, nature enthusiast\, or simply want to know about this beautiful white continent\, this journey promises to inspire and perhaps spark dreams of your own voyage to Antarctica. \n

SUMMARY:The Rasika
DESCRIPTION:What do you really see when a classical dancer takes the stage? \nIs it the beauty of the movement\, the rhythm of the music\, or the story unfolding before your eyes? This evening invites you to look closer\, to discover the richness within Indian classical dance; the traditional repertoire\, the interplay of melody and rhythm\, the subtle gestures that carry meaning\, and the role of texts that shape interpretation. \nGuided by Dr. Sahana Das\, a seasoned choreographer and researcher\, the session opens up the world of classical dance in ways that both newcomers and longtime rasikas can enjoy. Adding depth and texture are dancers Kirti Ramgopal and Meghna Das\, who bring their own artistry in Bharatanatyam and Odissi to the conversation. \nThrough reflection and performance\, the evening gently unravels the intricacies of these timeless traditions\, reminding us that dance is not just to be seen: it is to be experienced\, understood\, and felt! \n
