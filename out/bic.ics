SUMMARY:Handmade Guitars: Passion in the Art & Craft of Lutherie
DESCRIPTION:Lutherie is the making of stringed instruments out of wood\, by hand. \nMost of us are used to seeing factory-made instruments and tend to take them for granted. Understanding Lutherie gives us a glimpse into a very different world – one that combines design\, deep understanding of tone and timbre and the manner in which every part of a guitar affects them\, extreme respect for details and more details\, the love of wood and mastery over craftsmanship of wood – a world of limitless possibilities\, where no two instruments are ever alike. \nThis is the story of a pair of luthier-made instruments\, a Bass and a Guitar; the passion and love that created them and the extraordinary relationship between Luthier and Musician they are based upon. \nThis session provides a glimpse into an art and a craft that has immense intricacies and of which very\, very few people (including guitar players) are aware. Vinoo Matthew will demonstrate to people that there are no limits to intricacy and detail in anything one might choose to do – handmade garments to surgery to corporate governance. \nThe talk will be followed by a performance by the Sarpajur Blues Band\, a duo consisting of Vinoo Matthew on electric guitar and Shekhar Seshadri on acoustic guitar. The Sarjapur Blues Band (SBB) is an underground\, eclectic\, backstreet\, workingmen’s\, original\, rhythm and blues band \n

SUMMARY:Taking the Temperature of Society

SUMMARY:The Universe in a Pot

SUMMARY:A Crossroads of Empires
DESCRIPTION:The early medieval period in South Karnataka was a time of vigorous cultural change. Between the 10th and 13th centuries CE\, it became a frontier region between the sprawling Chola and Chalukya empires\, allowing for migration\, the development of new trade networks\, and the rise of innovative temple cultures. Tamil peasant-warriors and traders settled in South Karnataka\, significantly contributing to the region’s already cosmopolitan character—an influence still visible in the temple architecture of Bengaluru and its vicinity. The Chola presence also introduced new models of royal power that shaped the emerging Hoysala dynasty. Drawing on architectural\, art historical\, and epigraphical material\, Anirudh Kanisetti examines the Chola impact on South Karnataka and how it continues to shape Bengaluru’s urbanism today. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Dirty Sky
DESCRIPTION:English | 73 mins | India | 2025 \nIn an era where our lives increasingly depend on satellites for everything from communication to weather forecasting\, The Dirty Sky delves into the escalating crisis of orbital debris – the uncontrolled trash accumulating in space. Through a detailed exploration of the history of satellite launches\, the film sheds light on the exponential increase in non-functional satellites\, leading to a severe threat to our orbital environment and space sustainability. It underscores the growing dangers posed by orbital debris\, which\, much like terrestrial pollution\, is an unseen but pervasive threat to space activities. The Dirty Sky emphasizes the urgency for global awareness and action. It advocates for the public and world leaders to raise a concerted voice\, urging competing nations and commercial companies to take concrete steps before our beautiful sky becomes as uninhabitable as the polluted seas and air on Earth – the only home humanity has. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A session with the filmmaker. \n  \n

SUMMARY:Barahmasi | बारहमासी
DESCRIPTION:Barahmasi\, is an amalgamation of semi classical genres sung throughout the year just like the Periwinkle or Barahmasi flower that blooms round the year. An enchanting curation of thumri\, dadra\, tappa\, chaiti\, kajri\, hori\, jhoola\, ghazal\, bhajan and beautiful Malwi folk tunes\, Barahmasi is an interactive show featuring Kanakshree and Savni Bhatt where they will perform the 12 semi-classical forms of Indian music that resonate throughout the year. Delve into the harmonious world of Indian classical music\, where each note is steeped in tradition and brought to life with the passion of two generations. \nIt has been observed that Indian Classical mehfils often end with a semi classical composition like thumri\, dadra or sometimes the season dependent chaiti or kajri. However\, the constraints of time and season shouldn’t stop one from enjoying these forms at any time of the year… The very thought gave birth to Barahmasi where one walks out with songs of the year that echo in one’s heart and a one of its kind experiences where all of the said forms come together in a single concert. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Rise of Sport in India
DESCRIPTION:India’s sporting landscape has dramatically transformed over the past few decades. Traditionally dominated by cricket\, the country has emerged as a powerhouse in multiple disciplines\, including badminton\, wrestling\, boxing\, and athletics. \nThe rise of leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL)\, Pro Kabaddi League\, and Indian Super League (ISL) has played a crucial role in popularizing various sports and providing financial support to athletes. Additionally\, India’s improved performance in global events like the Olympics\, Commonwealth Games\, and Asian Games has boosted national pride. Charu Sharma with his decades of experience leading RCB and even conceptualizing Kabbadi League will tell this story. \nThe Devatha Radhakrishna Memorial Lecture \nDevatha Radhakrishna was not only a visionary entrepreneur but a lifelong seeker—curious\, resilient\, and deeply reflective. From building a thriving silk and garment empire to exploring law\, organic farming\, and philosophy\, he approached every pursuit with passion and purpose. Even in adversity\, he found meaning\, drawing strength from the wisdom of D.V. Gundappa and Tolstoy. To him\, business\, literature\, and spirituality were not separate paths but part of a single journey. This memorial lecture honours a life lived with conviction\, curiosity\, and an unyielding spirit. \nPresented by: Sriram Devatha. \n
