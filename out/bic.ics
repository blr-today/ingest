SUMMARY:The Future of Great Nicobar
DESCRIPTION:In The Great Nicobar Betrayal\, Pankaj Sekhsaria\, one of the best known chroniclers of contemporary issues in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands\, has compiled a set of articles written by various experts across publications that examine the proposed project from every angle—environmental\, geological\, impact on local communities\, law\, due process\, and ecology. \nThese pieces together shed light on the magnitude of the disaster that will be unleashed on this pristine place if the project comes through. The book is a warning and a catalogue of the manmade catastrophe that lurks on the horizon\, one that will destroy more than the tsunami of December 2004 ever did. \nIn this session\, Pankaj Sekhsaria is in conversation with Prof. Lawrence Surendra and Vaishna Roy. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

But like all the great works\, this play has a possibility. of presentation beyond space and time. This production is such an attempt to transpose beyond all the boundaries. The ‘song’ of the valley crosses the valley\, the life inside the valley continues its song. the play unveils this conflict. \nThe play showcases and tries balance the lives of the aborigines who are alienated and enslaved in their own land\, the miracles of the land where small seeds grow into big fruit\, and the cities that sow the dream of liberation despite the many dangers. The play makes us not to see life in black and white\, but to see it through logical and rational vision. Here\, the playwright insists that the character of playwright and of Grandpa Bucks should be played by the same actor\, thereby directing us not to emotionally lean to any one side of the conflict. \nThis is how the song of the valley resounds; not only in our hearts\, but also in our minds:\nI am incredibly hurt and angry about South Africa’s history and present. But love is the only energy I’ve ever used as a writer. I’ve never written out of anger\, although anger has informed love. – Athol Fugard. \nCast and Crew:\nPlaywright: Athol Fugard\nTranslation: Dr. Meera Moorthy\nMusic: Anush Shetty and Munna Mysore\nMusic Accompaniment: Chethan Singanallur\nLighting: Vinay Ganesh\, Mysore\nPainting: H.

SUMMARY:"I Eat God\, I Drink God"
DESCRIPTION:Wild Women: Seekers\, Protagonists and Goddesses in Sacred Indian Poetry [Penguin India\, 2024]\, edited by poet and seeker Arundhathi Subramaniam\, is a new anthology of compelling women mystics in Indian literature. \nThese poems are the cries of women who refused\, quietly\, and sometimes not so quietly\, to be bullied into submission. Women who surrendered not to the authority of the world\, but to the authority of the spirit. Women whose voices have far too often been sanitized by the grand narratives of religion and sidelined by rationalist versions of history. \nThe names of Mirabai\, Akka Mahadevi\, and Andal\, are known to many. But there are innumerable others. And little is known of the urgency of their words\, of their feral sensuality\, of their relentless questioning of the custodians of gender and faith. It is time to re-fang them\, to tune into their brazenness and heartbreaking longing. Not just for their sake\, but for ours. \nThis conversation with Arundhathi Subramaniam\, interspersed by readings of translations by Mani Rao\, Vanamala Viswanatha and Ahalya Ballal\, will explore some fascinating and unforgettable women. \n

SUMMARY:INHERITAGE
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: Friday\, 14 June\, 11:00 am \nTimings:\nFriday\, 14 June | 11:00 am – 8:00 pm\nSaturday\, 15 June | 11:00 am – 5:00 pm\nSunday\, 16 June | 11:00 am – 8:00 pm \nPerformance:\nSaturday\, 15 June | 7:00 pm \nINHERITAGE\, conceived and created by choreographer Preethi Athreya\, is a performance installation that traces a relationship with objects inherited\, passed on or lost. Through a choreographic lens\, it looks at objects that speak to a cultural and colonial heritage\, embodying critical questions of our attachment to ‘belongings’\, to the idea of ‘belonging’ and to place. \nThe installation presents a personal collection of thirteen objects inherited\, owned\, acquired or lost to bring out a history of their transactions beyond ownership\, origin and identity. How can the act of looking\, touching or holding these objects be a way to ‘read’ them? The objects are displayed as photographic images. Scan the QR codes on each image to listen to an account of their journeys. These writings\, in turn\, find their way into the body in a dance film that accompanies the images. Interrupting this assembly of image\, sound and film is periodical live movement that punctuates the tableau. \nPerformance: ‘how are things …?’\nSaturday\, 15 June | 7:00 pm\n \n‘how are things …?’ is a 50 minute solo performance within the context of the performance installation INHERITAGE by choreographer Preethi Athreya. Through a development of text\, movement and sound\, Preethi presents a personal ‘archaeology’ of objects inherited\, passed on or lost. By tracing the journey of things into our lives\, she asks  – can we make an anatomical\, speculative fiction of objects? Can we trace ‘her-stories’ (and not totalising and reductive ‘his’tories) of objects found not in the museum\, but in our family homes\, that have written us into being …?  \nINHERITAGE was produced by the CHARCOAL platform for collaboration with support from Prakriti Foundation and the Alliance Française of Madras. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Mad and Divine
DESCRIPTION:An insight into the life and teachings of Janabai\, 13th Century and Lalded\, 14th Century. Both were women mystic poets who went through tremendous hardships before they were recognised for their spiritual awakenings. They crossed barriers of social norms to fearlessly express their love for the Supreme. \nThey were different in approach but MAD and DIVINE. Janabai was a Vaishnavait while Lalded was a Shaivaite. Janabai believed in the form while Lalded believed in the formless. Janabai took the path of devotion while Lalded took the path of tantra. \nMad and Divine was first commissioned by Dr. Anita Ratnam for the Natya Darshan at Kartik Fine Arts Chennai\, in 2011. \nChoreographed and presented by Rama Vaidyanathan\nMusic for Janabai | Sudha Raghuraman\nMusic for Lalded | Dr. S Vasudevan with creative inputs by Sudha Raghuraman\nVocal | Sudha Raghuraman\nNattuvangam | Dr S Vasudevan\nMridangam | Sumod Sreedharan\nFlute | G Raghuraman\nValuable inputs in the storytelling technique from Rajika Puri \nIn collaboration with:\n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Open Source\, Open Knowledge
DESCRIPTION:This event is a 3-hour seminar on intellectual property in India\, hosted by Professor Lawrence Liang and Carl Malamud of the Servants of Knowledge Initiative. \nThis seminar is aimed at people who spend time on Access to Knowledge\, Free and Open Software\, and other civic technologies. \nOpen source software\, and Creative Commons licensing emerged as an important challenge to the dominant narrative of copyright law. The framework of open knowledge has played a pivotal role in democratizing information\, fostering collaboration\, and empowering creators and users alike. However\, in the last two decades\, we have also witnessed their limitations\, especially when it comes to addressing the question of infrastructure. Physical libraries are a good example of how the limitations of physical goods and severely constrained infrastructures still serve as a impediment to access to knowledge. \nIn the domain of library infrastructure\, one particularly noteworthy innovation is the digitization of books\, a process that transforms physical texts into accessible digital assets. Book scanning\, as a cornerstone of digital library infrastructure\, offers a compelling case study in navigating the intricate landscape of copyright exceptions and controlled lending. At its core\, book scanning epitomizes the transformative power of technology in democratizing access to knowledge. By digitizing print collections\, libraries can transcend physical constraints\, reaching those who traditionally do not have access and ensuring the preservation of knowledge for future generations. However\, the process of digitization raises complex legal considerations\, particularly in relation to copyright law. \nIn many jurisdictions\, copyright exceptions and limitations provide a legal framework for libraries to digitize and make available certain works without seeking explicit permission from rights holders. These exceptions often encompass activities such as preservation\, research\, and access for individuals with print disabilities. However\, the scope and applicability of these exceptions vary widely across jurisdictions\, posing challenges for libraries seeking to navigate a patchwork of legal regimes. \nIn this workshop\, we focus on copyright law in India and contend that the design of exceptions and limitations in India are particularly facilitative of access. Using case studies such as the Delhi University photocopy case\, the Sci-Hub case and the Hatchette case on Controlled digital lending\, we will probe questions of how copyright in India can be used to facilitate the creation of infrastructures of knowledge. Using our experience at servants of knowledge\, of scanning large libraries\, we propose a framework that brings together open source activists\, book collectors\, librarians\, students\, researchers and authors under a common platform “Public library of India”\, designed to imagine digital infrastructure for 21st century India. \nFor further reading: \n\nLiang and Malamud\, Controlled Lending by Public Libraries Under Indian Law\, https://archive.org/details/Controlled.Lending.India/Controlled.Lending.20230505.pamphlet/\nMalamud\, Gyan Satyagraha\, Remarks Delivered at Kannada University\, https://archive.org/details/kannada.university.20240415/02-kannada.university.20240415/\nLiang and Gupta\, The Public Library Movement in India\, https://archive.org/details/public.library.movement.india\n\nPresented by: \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Ocean of Wetness
DESCRIPTION:We live in an all-consuming wetness that is everywhere in the air\, earth\, seas\, flora and fauna. It precipitates\, evaporates\, storms\, seeps\, soaks\, transpires\, osmotes\, condenses. We exist in this ‘Ocean’ as wet stuff ourselves\, our wetness necessary to our existence. However\, we are not educated to inhabit this Ocean. We are rather educated to inhabit an Earth with a surface of land served by water confined to a place behind a line. This surfaced Earth\, we suggest\, is the outcome of a design project intent on making an object that benefits a few at the cost of the many\, an object that serves science\, civilization and cities\, but also colonization and systemic oppression. Today\, this Earth is in trouble from climate change\, threatened (and violated) by the water it has sought to enslave. It faces sea level rise\, floods\, increasingly frequent\, violent and unpredictable storm events\, and the melting of ice caps. To us\, these are not problems to solve; they are calls to review a design project that has proved unjust\, unwise and disastrous. Does an Ocean of Wetness offer an alternative? \nJoin us as Prof. Dilip da Cunha lays out an alternative to interpret ‘landscapes’ as a gradient of wetness over the binary of ‘land’ and ‘water’. This talk will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Kārunya Sindhu | Ocean of Mercy
DESCRIPTION:Karuna or Kārunya is one of the navarasā-s (nine emotions) of the Indian cultural pantheon\, embodying the highest form of unconditional compassion and mercy. \nSince time immemorial\, poets\, saints\, composers and bhakta-s (devotees) have performed sādhana (ardent practice of any pursuit) with a yearning for divine Karuna. When Narayana Bhattathiri wrote the magnum opus Narayaneeyam in the 16th century\, he said\, “Oh Krishna\, oh Kārunya Sindhu! May your feet\, where all the liberated souls reside\, always rest in my heart. Oh\, ocean of compassion\, destroy all my sorrows and confer an abundant flow of Supreme Bliss”. In the 19th Century\, Patnam Subramania Iyer composed a Kriti pleading Lord Venkatesha to forgive all his sins and bestow abundant Kripa (mercy) with no further delay. Even when we make a prayer today\, it is only natural for us to seek the Lord’s Karuna. It is also this very unconditional empathy that we have for one another that makes the world a beautiful place. \nThis concert through the evocative literature and music of composers like Tyagaraja\, Patnam Subramania Iyer\, the Dāsā-s and others\, hopes to invoke this Ocean of Mercy\, this Kārunya Sindhu. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Art as Activism
DESCRIPTION:This discussion is set in the context of the recent ruling from the Karnataka High Court that limits public protests in Bangalore to a designated space within one park in the city\, that too subject to police approval. It aims to explore how art can serve as an alternative medium for voicing dissent and fueling public discourse. \nThe panel will discuss the ramifications of the Court’s ruling and its impact on communities\, and talk about art as a potent tool for social change. Through their experiences\, the panelists will demonstrate how art can amplify voices\, provoke thought\, and catalyze change even amidst growing restrictions on dissent. \n

SUMMARY:Achintya - Beyond Perception
DESCRIPTION:Achintya – Beyond Perception is a solo dance production exploring the concept of truth and humanity’s ongoing pursuit of it. Performed by Deeksha Kumar\, the production combines Bharatanatyam with storytelling to examine the philosophical aspects of truth. \nThe performance features a series of movements\, each representing different facets of truth – from its elusive nature to the clarity it brings when understood. The choreography reflects the complex journey of seeking truth\, with movements symbolizing the struggle and eventual enlightenment of this quest. \nIn one section of Achintya – Beyond Perception\, the imagery of sand is used to convey the philosophy of non-duality and the elusive nature of truth. Seated in front of a box of sand\, the performer holds the grains in their hands\, allowing them to slip through their fingers to symbolise the transient and ever-changing nature of truth. Through a sequence\, two separate piles of sand are created\, only to be merged into a single pile\, visually representing the concept of non-duality — the ultimate realisation that all is one. This interaction with sand underscores the performance’s exploration of truth and unity. \nOriginal music\, blending classical and modern elements\, underscores the performance and enhances its emotional depth. The score integrates traditional instruments with contemporary sounds\, creating an auditory experience that mirrors the dancer’s journey. The music’s shifts and harmonies amplify the emotional intensity\, guiding the audience through a sensory experience. \nAchintya – Beyond Perception is a dance that encourages audiences to reflect on their own journeys towards truth. This production aims to be a thought-provoking and visually engaging experience that resonates with viewers long after the final bow. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Is Demography Destiny?
DESCRIPTION:In the context of contemporary US elections\, many have claimed that “demography is destiny.” This kind of rhetoric became particularly popular among Democratic strategists after Barack Obama was elected in 2008. On this theory\, Democrats will have a significant advantage in upcoming national\, particularly presidential\, elections\, given the party’s widespread appeal among a multiracial and otherwise diverse coalition of voters. The Republican Party\, in this view\, has made a strategic miscalculation by relying too heavily on white (particularly white male) voters\, especially since the Nixon years. In recent years\, however\, there is a growing sense among many observers that demography may not\, after all\, be destiny; that voting behavior may not neatly align along a white-nonwhite divide\, with non-Hispanic white men voting for the Republican Party and the rest of the country voting Democrat. \nIn this lecture\, Prof. Cyril Ghosh will offer an overview of this debate\, with some remarks about what we might expect to see in the 2024 US presidential elections. In so doing\, he will discuss the demographic make-up of the voting blocs of each of the two major parties in the US\, how they came to be\, and how they are likely to vote in November 2024. \n

SUMMARY:The City and the Scam
DESCRIPTION:In this event\, Professor Malini Ranganathan will discuss her new book\, Corruption Plots: Stories\, Ethics\, and Publics of the Late Capitalist City (Yoda\, 2024). Through ethnographic fieldwork\, the book studies what its co-authors call “corruption plots” from the streets of Bengaluru and Mumbai\, where black money\, skyscrapers\, land grabs\, encroachment on wetlands\, and slum evictions invoke outrage at deepening economic polarization and the impunity with which the real estate lobby operates. Flying in the face of conventional wisdom\, the book argues that corruption is a story-telling practice charged with ethical meaning\, one that does not simply condemn illegality or bribery\, but is also used to call attention to the legal—and legalized—abuses of power by the state\, political class\, and elites. \nAt the same time\, the book warns that anger by various publics about corruption is uneven\, inflected by caste\, class\, and ethno-religious bias\, especially in the context of rightwing nationalism and crony capitalism in India. Why do certain things get called “corruption” while others don’t—and why do corruption charges suddenly erupt into public discourse\, while at other times remain muted in the background?  \nDrawing on ethnography in two Indian cities undertaken in 2018\, as well as a cross-section of films and novels on the global city (in India and beyond)\, this book attends to the political slipperiness\, sensationalism\, and opportunism associated with corruption talk\, wherein fantastical scams about the city can often appear more fictional than factual. Ultimately\, in deriving a humanistic and multifaceted theory of corruption—sorely lacking in one-dimensional policy pronouncements—the book contends that across the world’s ostensible democracies\, we need a more grounded analysis of how anti-corruption has been selectively championed and challenged\, and with what effects\, by both liberal and rightwing regimes. The author will briefly discuss the book\, followed by a conversation with Professor Sushmita Pati and an audience Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:Just Hiss
DESCRIPTION:50 minutes | English and Kannada  \nJust Hiss is a compelling adaptation of the short folk story titled A Serpent’s Predicament. Just Hiss is an ode to coexistence\, following the transformative journey of a snake to choose love over hate. As the play navigates the complex dynamics between the snake\, the forest denizens\, and the villagers of Rasbharpur\, it skillfully tackles the universal themes of unity and understanding. The resonant narrative serves as a reminder of the profound impact that choices\, particularly those rooted in love and compassion\, can have on fostering harmony in a world shared by diverse beings. \nDirector’s note: \nJust Hiss is not just a play; it is a whimsical journey crafted especially for children\, featuring endearing animal characters. At its heart\, it unfolds an analogical tale\, resonant with the pressing message of our times—understanding the limitations of one’s perspective and the imperative need to embrace and accommodate others. \nConceived with meticulous care and having undergone several work-in-progress phases\, this play is a testament to the idea that assumptions should yield to genuine inquiry. It serves as a reminder to care enough to ask\, fostering the spirit of coming together and progressing impactfully. \n

SUMMARY:दुविधा | Duvidha
DESCRIPTION:1973 | 82 Minutes | Hindi with English Subtitles \nThe body of a renegade Brahmin awaits a funeral. The man in question flouted Brahmin caste regulations\, attracting a cadre of youthful followers. However\, the Brahmin elders of his village cannot decide whether to give him a traditional Brahmin cremation or treat him as an outcast. Until they decide\, neither they nor their immediate families may eat. This film offers an intriguing glimpse into the lives and issues surrounding an orthodox community. \nCalling all cinephiles! BIC is thrilled to introduce B-Cinematic\, an initiative dedicated to celebrating the most essential\, impactful\, and artistically significant cinematic works from across the state and the country. \nAt B-Cinematic\, our mission is to curate and share those remarkable films that is a must-watch (or re-watch) experience for every passionate cinema lover. From groundbreaking classics to under-appreciated gems\, our carefully curated selection will take you on an unparalleled (pun not intended) cinematic journey through the ages. \nThrough curated screenings\, insightful discussions\, and engaging analyses from distinguished cinematic voices\, we aim to not only watch these films together but to truly appreciate their craftsmanship\, cultural impact\, and intellectual depth. Our vibrant community of film aficionados will collectively rediscover Indian cinema’s most stunning and enduring masterpieces. \nSo join us on this quest to experience the films that have defined and redefined the art form. Don’t miss out on crossing these essential works off your bucket list. Because to truly live\, you must first watch the films that make life worth living. \nThe second film in our informal film club is Samskara (1970) \nSamskara is a critically acclaimed Kannada film directed by T Pattabhirama Reddy\, released in 1970. It is based on the 1965 novel of the same name by UR Ananthamurthy. The film offers a thought-provoking exploration of traditional Brahmin society and its rigid customs. \nThe story revolves around a small Brahmin agrahara (village) that is thrown into turmoil after the death of Naranappa\, a Brahmin man known for his defiance of caste rules and unorthodox lifestyle. His unconventional ways had earned him the wrath of the agrahara’s conservative leaders. \nAfter Naranappa’s death\, the question arises whether he should be given the traditional Brahmin funeral rites or denied them due to his transgressions against caste norms. This dilemma deeply divides the agrahara\, with ideological conflicts arising between the youths influenced by Naranappa’s progressive thinking and the rigidly orthodox elderly Brahmin custodians of tradition. \nThe film sensitively portrays the agrahara’s decaying feudal system and the inner contradictions plaguing its self-appointed patriarchal authorities as they grapple with existential questions about ritualism\, sexuality\, and the rapidly changing social mores. It offers a nuanced critique of entrenched casteism\, misogyny\, and blind adherence to outdated customs. \nWith its authentic depiction of the Brahmin way of life\, powerful symbolism\, and philosophical undertones\, Samskara is regarded as a landmark film in Kannada cinema’s Parallel Cinema movement and a masterpiece of Indian neo-realist filmmaking. \nThe film won the President’s Gold Medal in 1971 and the Bronze Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1972 among several other recognitions. \nCredits: \nBased on UR Ananthmurthy’s Kannada novel\, Samskara; Translated to English by AK Ramanujan\nProduced and Directed by Pattabhirama Reddy\nScreenplay: Girish Karnad\, T Pattabhirama Reddy and Singeetam Srinivasa Rao\nDialogue: Girish Karnad\nProduced: Pattabhirama Reddy\nCast: Girish Karnad\, Snehalata Reddy\, P.

SUMMARY:ಅಮ್ಮ ಮತ್ತು ಸುಹೈಲ್ | Amma Mattu Suhail
DESCRIPTION:Kannada | 90 minutes | Suitable for Ages 16+  \nThe play is an ode to queer love. It is a meditation on the values of empathy and dialogue as powerful agents to bring estranged minds together. The narrative traverses through moments of passion\, anger\, sadness\, and love in its raw human element. The characters attempt to interrogate\, understand\, and acknowledge each other\, and in this process\, unveil the universality of all emotions as being the same\, irrespective of gender and orientation. The play tries to deconstruct and lay open the psychological and emotional baggage of the characters who are but symbols of the divided humanity that we are today. An interfaith gay couple and the mother of one of the characters venture on a journey of understanding one another rather light-heartedly through uncomfortable conversations\, only to explore depths which they never knew or imagined would be possible to unearth. \n\n\n\n\nPlaywright/Director’s Note: \nWith the drastic change in the political discourse the world has witnessed in the last few years\, one cannot but notice the drastic emergence of an undeniable divide within humanity. There are two segments that appear to be in stark contrast\, constantly struggling and fighting with each other. There is a constant othering and exclusion of minorities by the majority in power. During the pandemic\, the apathy by the political class at large was glaringly visible and we witnessed in full display the class disparity that envelops our nation. The Hindu – Muslim rhetoric was constantly fed to us through public discourse and hate was offered as a staple diet for even those who refused to be part of it. \nThe artist felt compelled to speak up\, believing that love is the only antidote to the vehement poison of hate. They hence decided to write and direct this play that features the love story of a gay couple hailing from the Hindu and Muslim communities. Diversity cannot be celebrated without the intersectionality that makes for the complex mix of the society we are. The play intends to hold the mirror to the microaggressions and biases that consume us all through humor and emotional storytelling. \nWith music\, love\, and humor\, the play tries to unravel the demons of Islamophobia and homophobia in us all. It celebrates the value of empathetic dialogue and honest communication in eradicating hate. Amma mattu Suhail is a tender story of love\, acceptance\, and possibilities. \nThe artist is a classical musician\, writer\, and theatre practitioner\, and their arts practice is always an amalgamation of these elements. They create out of necessity! Having grown up queer and gender fluid\, they struggled to find representation in the Kannada arts scene and were disappointed. They tried to fit in and adapt to the arts “as is” but eventually found it suffocating and had to carve out their own path and create what they wanted to engage with. They strive to bring marginalized voices to the fore and their stories or creations always aim to question and break patriarchal stereotypes and conditioning. Their search is always to find fluidity. Just like their characters either in the plays they have written or in the dance-based compositions they have created\, which always traverse through the non-binary nature of gender identity or sexuality\, the art they create yearns to find fluidity in form and content. They break the structure and form using non-linear narratives\, democratic – secular emotional indulgences\, and fluid emotional paradigms. They attempt to convey the grotesque bizarreness of our social existence with humor and the humorous\, funny realities that define us through the macabre. \nThey always like to begin with an uncomfortable space and establish familiarity with the unfamiliar. Most importantly\, they want their art to be accessible to all class and caste sections of society. They often find it very difficult to mold their form in a way that does not “other” an audience which has no access to learning arts appreciation or delving into abstraction. While they try to abstain from dumbing down their audience\, they make it a priority to make their arts inclusive. Having been in circles where art is created and consumed in the same vicious elitist spaces and circles\, they yearn to connect to a larger canvas. \nHaving written\, produced\, and directed three plays\, their exploration has always yearned to find that fluidity between sound and silence\, prose and poetry\, body and realism. They aim to tell more queer stories which are embraced by the mainstream and more mainstream stories which make the queer community feel that they are “seen”. Whilst they are cognizant of the brutal grays that marginalized voices live in\, they believe we need more positive representation of these marginalized characters. Their younger queer self wanted to watch happy endings and stories of hope and not just suicide and tragedies. They work only on stories which are fictional retellings of lived experiences and also for these stories to be specifically told in Kannada. Regional languages have the power to automatically place these stories in a certain space while also making sure to remove them from only English-speaking elite spaces. They strive to create work which opens itself to a more vulnerable audience who need to hear\, get uncomfortable\, and feel ignited towards a spirit of inquiry through these stories. \nThey will be glad if their art is also entertaining but they will never be okay if it is not activism. \nCredits: \nPlaywright – Direction – Music : Karthik Hebbar\nCast: Dr Seetha Kote\, B V Shrunga\, Arun D T\nLighting: M G Naveen\nProduced by Dheemahi Theatre \nDheemahi Theatre was born out of the need to create a safe space for new voices. We are a space for the “outsiders”. We have come together to tell stories that have been oppressed and suppressed in other majoritarian spaces. Empathy and humanity are the main focuses of all the work that we create. We as a team thrive on celebrating diversity and secular narratives by exploring and devising new techniques for facilitating these stories. We work around minimalist production setups and maximal internal processes. With a passion for storytelling that transcends boundaries\, we strive to create a stage that reflects the kaleidoscope of human experiences. Our productions are more than performances; they are a canvas of shared narratives that resonate with the richness of our collective journey. We aspire to weave together tales that inspire\, provoke thought\, and unite us in the magic of the theatre. \nSupported by: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
