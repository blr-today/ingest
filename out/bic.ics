SUMMARY:The Making of Modern Karnataka
DESCRIPTION:Karnataka is one of India’s most diverse states\, as rich in literary and cultural traditions as it is in democratic struggles and political churns. The 20th century witnessed the birth of a modern Kannada renaissance\, accompanied by the emergence of a powerful social conscience.  Against this backdrop\, one young man’s quest to explore his vibrant historical roots leads to an ambitious attempt to unpack the region’s social and cultural histories. \nRama Bhima Soma is an enterprise of translation and rediscovery\, packed with stories and conversations. The book explores a dizzyingly wide sweep of Karnataka’s contemporary history—the life and times of legends like Kuvempu and Shivaram Karanth; the fall of Socialism and the rise of the Hindu Right; the intellectual ruminations of U.R. Ananthamurthy\, D.R. Nagaraj and M.M. Kalburgi; the wildly popular television serials of T.N. Seetharam and the community-centred one-woman theatre shows of Du Saraswathi; a brief history of Naxalism in Karnataka and glimpses of other complicated legacies of the 1970s’ Left. \nMarshalling a diverse range of literary and scholarly resources\, framed through biographical sketches and immersive reportage\, this session will reanimate some pivotal moments in the making of modern Karnataka. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Out of the Middling Middle
DESCRIPTION:Midlife is a phase when we find ourselves pulled in multiple directions—across work\, home\, health\, friendships\, and hobbies. \nIn this session\, Ravi Venkatesan delves into themes from Deepak Jayaraman’s recent book\, Play to Potential. The book offers a nuanced exploration of how to unlock human potential—not just professionally but holistically—by embracing life’s highs and lows. Drawing from his acclaimed Play to Potential podcast and his experiences as a coach\, Deepak introduces the FLAVOUR framework\, a practical guide to navigating the intricate interplay of family\, aspirations\, values\, and relationships. \nDeepak emphasises that life is a team sport\, with family serving as an essential support system. He argues that personal growth and achievement are deeply intertwined with our family contexts\, a perspective often overlooked in self-help literature\, particularly in cultures where family plays a central role. \nA key insight of the book is the recognition that life unfolds in seasons\, shaped by transitions—some intentional\, others unexpected. Using real-life examples and case studies\, Deepak illustrates how navigating these transitions thoughtfully is vital to realising our potential. \nThis discussion will resonate with anyone in their 30s to 60s\, offering valuable strategies to lead a multi-dimensional\, purposeful life. A Q&A session will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Dido and Aeneas
DESCRIPTION:Dido and Aeneas in Bangalore is a unique collaboration project\, bringing together some of the finest musicians from India and Sweden\, in a performance of one of the most beloved chamber operas from the Baroque-period. Experience the passionate drama through stirring instrumental music\, dance\, arias and choirs – a must-see-hear in Bangalore in 2025! \nDido and Aeneas is based on Book IV of Virgil’s epic The Aeneid. It is one of the earliest known English operas\, and one of the most important and often performed operas written in the Baroque period. It is also Henry Purcell’s only true opera; that is\, his only all-sung dramatic work. \nWhat is most remarkable for such an important work in the opera repertoire\, is that so little about it is known. A copy of a libretto from the 1700’s exists (possibly from the first performance)\, so we know it originally was composed as a Prologue and Opera. However\, the music for the Prologue\, the end of the act II Grove scene\, and several dances have been lost\, and indeed no score exists in Purcell’s handwriting. \nMoreover\, the dates of composition and the first performance are uncertain. It is known\, through references in letters\, that it was performed at a girls’ school in Chelsea\, London\, some time before the end of 1689. However\, some scholars argue that the opera was composed and performed for the Royal Court of either James II or Charles II with a date as early as 1684\, and argue that the reference in the Prologue to the joy of a marriage between two monarchs is an allegorical one. \nWhatever history of the opera is waiting to be uncovered\, what we do know\, and perhaps most important of all\, is that Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas is a deeply moving and unforgettable opera. \nDido\, Queen of Carthage – Maria Forsström\, mezzo-soprano\nAeneas\, Trojan hero – Rahul Bharadwaj\, baritone\nBelinda\, Dido’s confidante and handmaiden – Tanisha Herbert Rozario\, soprano\nSecond Lady – Rachel Mathew\, soprano\nSorceress – Sangita Santosham\, mezzo-soprano\n1st Witch – Rebekah Alexander\, soprano\n2nd Witch – Ketki Herlekar\, soprano\nA Sailor – Benson Chacko\, tenor\nA Spirit – Nora Alexy\, alto \nViolin – Carol George & Arun Rozario\nViola – Maria Winiarski\nCello – Kristina Winiarski\nBass – Jasiel Peter\nHarpsichord – Rebecca Thomas Colaco\nPercussion – Akshay Nagmule\nGuitar – Ryal Sequiera\nConductor – Sofia Winiarski \nCappella Bangalore\nThe Bangalore Men \nConductor – Jonas Olsson \nDancers from The Lewis Foundation of Classical Ballet\nChoreographer: Iryna Hryshukova\nDancers: Iryna Hryshukova\, Elina Wisung\, Ramya Manikam\, Tanvi Agarwal \nIn collaboration with Legato School of Music and The Lewis Foundation of Classical Ballet \n   \nSupported by the Swedish Arts Council and the Swedish Arts Grants Committee \n     \n

SUMMARY:Mission Young Citizens
DESCRIPTION:Who says children don’t understand civic rights? \nA 13-year-old girl’s drive led to a toilet being built in her village for the first time.

SUMMARY:The Constitution and its Makers
DESCRIPTION:The Indian Constitution\, which came into force on 26 January\, 1950 was prepared by the Constituent Assembly over a two and a half year period through a process of discussion and debate. There were close to 300 members in the Constituent Assembly. Besides the known members of the Assembly like Dr BR Ambedkar and Jawaharlal Nehru\, several others contributed to the making of the Constitution. \n10 Makers of the Indian Constitution introduces you to some of these makers. What were the lives of these makers like? What were their achievements? What were their contributions to the Constitution and to India in general? There are fascinating stories that lie hidden. \nWe at BIC have put together a day\, full of events at our Library\, to celebrate the 76th year of the Indian Constitution with kids at the heart of our programmes. Through stories\, quizzes\, and fun-filled sessions\, we aim to get young minds thinking a little bit more in depth about our constitution and country.  \nYou can view the other two events here and here. \n

SUMMARY:Nature's Wild Child
DESCRIPTION:India has a unique relationship with the mango. It is all over our cultural life and festivals. Our emotional life and our social existence. Our markets and our countryside. It is the only fruit that is a festival unto itself. Each year\, cities organize their own mango festivals that are extremely popular events. No other fruit seems to have a comparable role anywhere else. The mango seems intimately familiar to almost all Indians\, nay\, all residents of South Asia. Yet we are unaware of the wider role of the mango fruit\, leaves\, flowers\, trees\, orchards and groves in almost every facet of our lives through our known and unknown history. In politics\, economics\, land ownership\, infrastructure\, ecological (and psychological) health\, propaganda\, diplomacy\, ecology\, festivities\, funerals\, weddings\, seduction\, poetry\, the arts\, architecture… \nDrawing from the recently published bestseller Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango\, this discussion will join the ubiquitous excitement around mangoes to look towards avenues untrodden\, histories unconsidered\, festivals abandoned. The event will take place close to the time that marked India’s myriad spring festivals\, the symbol of which was the mango flower. The known mango is a bridge to a lot about us that is either unknown or goes unacknowledged. \nThe author\, Sopan Joshi will be in conversation with Venu Madhav Govindu which will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Aradhana Saraswati
DESCRIPTION:The concert pays homage to the Goddess Saraswati\, revered through the ages as the embodiment of the four essentials of a discerning human life: Speech (Vaani)\, the foundation of communication and expression; Music (Sangeet)\, the universal language of harmony and emotion; Wisdom (Buddhi)\, the guiding light of understanding and insight; and Discrimination (Vivek)\, the power to discern and choose wisely. \nThrough a journey of timeless raags and original compositions\, our musicians delve into these eternal qualities\, reflecting the grace and profundity that the Goddess represents. This celebration is not just a tribute to Saraswati but a call to connect with the divine essence of creativity\, intellect\, and balance within us all. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Thief Who Stole My Heart
DESCRIPTION:This talk by commences by introducing the audience to the sacred bronzes created by a master sculptor around the year 1000\, and suggests that his inspiration may well have been child-saint Sambandar’s opening hymn that hails god Shiva as “the thief who stole my heart.” \nVidya Dehejia explores this sensuous imagery before moving to ask questions of this material that have not been asked before. Where did the Cholas acquire the copper required to cast the many temple bronzes that are solid heavy pieces of metal? Why were the Cholas obsessed with island Sri Lanka? What were the circumstances that permitted the creation of hundreds of temples and vast numbers of sacred bronzes despite the constant warfare that the Chola monarchs were engaged in? What was the source of the extraordinarily vast number of pearls that\, together with coral\, rubies and diamonds\, were embedded in gold jewelry gifted to adorn temple bronzes? Why did the Cholas cover the walls of their temple walls with inscriptions– some 13\,000 in total – using temple walls as if they were the public records office? \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:शून्यता–समानता | Emptiness–Equality
DESCRIPTION:In this musical introduction to The Notbook of Kabir\, Anand will demonstrate how Kabir often translates and improvises on––and returns to––the Buddha. What is the relationship between Sunnyata (शून्यता\, the void) and Samaanta (समानता\, equality)? How does the raga that is nirgun (निर्गुण)\, beyond form and quality (गुण)\, enfold\, embody and inform form\, and help us experience both being and nothingness? \nFollowing a brief performance\, Anand will be in conversation with Kotiganahalli Ramaiah\, poet\, playwright\, translator and song-writer renowned in the Kannada world. \n
