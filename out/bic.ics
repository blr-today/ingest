SUMMARY:ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ ಬಂತು #ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ | Kranthi Bantu #Kranthi
DESCRIPTION:\n110 minutes | Kannada | For all ages \n ಕಲಾವಿಲಾಸಿ ತಂಡದವರು ರೂಪಿಸಿರುವ “ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ ಬಂತು #ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ”ಯು\,  ಪಿ. ಲಂಕೇಶ್ ಅವರ 1971ರ ನಾಟಕ “ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ ಬಂತು ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ”ಯ ಒಂದು ಪ್ರಭಾವಶಾಲಿ ಆಧುನಿಕ ಆವೃತ್ತಿ. ದಶಕಗಳುೇ ಕಳೆಯಿದ್ದರೂ\, ಅದರ ಮೂಲಾಂಶದಲ್ಲಿರುವ ಅಸಮಾನತೆ\, ಅಧಿಕಾರ\, ಮತ್ತು ನ್ಯಾಯಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಹೋರಾಟ ಎಂಬ ವಿಷಯಗಳು ಇಂದಿಗೂ ಪ್ರಚಲಿತವಾಗಿವೆ. ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ ಎಂಬುದು ಸಮಾಜದ ಅವಿಭಾಜ್ಯ ಅವಸ್ಥೆಯಾಗಿದ್ದು\, ಈ ಕಥೆಯು ಪರಿಚಿತವಾಗಿದ್ದರೂ ಹೊಸತರಂತಿದೆ.  \nಪಾತ್ರಗಳು ತಮ್ಮದೇ ಆದ ಸತ್ಯ-ಅಸತ್ಯ\, ಸರಿ-ತಪ್ಪುಗಳ ಧಾರಣೆಯನ್ನು ಹೊತ್ತು\, ವಹಿವಾಟಿನ ಈ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆ\, ಮಾಧ್ಯಮಗಳ ತಿರುವುಮಾರು\, ಮತ್ತು ಸಾಮಾಜಿಕ ಅಶಾಂತಿಯಿಂದ ರೂಪುಗೊಂಡ ಜಗತ್ತಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಸಾಗುತ್ತಾರೆ. ತಾವೆ ಬದಲಾವಣೆ ತರಲು ಯತ್ನಿಸಿದ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಯ ಸೂಕ್ಷ್ಮತೆಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಅವರು ಸಿಲುಕುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಅವರ ಆಯ್ಕೆಗಳು ದರ್ಶಕರಾದ ನಮ್ಮ ಸತ್ಯ\, ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರತಿರೋಧದ ಪ್ರಶ್ನೆಗಳನ್ನು ಪ್ರತಿಬಿಂಬಿಸುತ್ತವೆ. \nಕ್ರಾಂತಿ ಬಂತು #ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ ಯುವಜನರು ತಮ್ಮ ಧ್ವನಿಗಳು ತಡೆಯಲ್ಪಟ್ಟಾಗ ಹೇಗೆ ಪ್ರತಿಕ್ರಿಯಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ\, ಇನ್‌ಫ್ಲುಯೆನ್ಸರ್‌ಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ಮಾಧ್ಯಮಗಳು\, ಜನರ ಕಥೆಗಳನ್ನು ಹೇಗೆ ವ್ಯವಹಾರಿಕವಾಗಿ ಬಳಸುತ್ತಾರೆ\, ಮತ್ತು ಅಭಿಪ್ರಾಯಗಳಿಂದ ತುಂಬಿಕೊಂಡ ಜಗತ್ತಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಅರಾಜಕತೆ ಹೇಗೆ ಹರಡಬಹುದು ಎಂಬುದನ್ನು ಅನ್ವೇಷಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ವ್ಯಂಗ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ಚಿಂತನಶೀಲ ಹಾಸ್ಯದ ಮೂಲಕ\, ಈ ನಾಟಕವು ಪ್ರೇಕ್ಷಕರನ್ನು ವಿವೇಚನೆ ಮಾಡಲು\, ಎಲ್ಲವನ್ನು ಪ್ರಶ್ನಿಸಲು ಆಹ್ವಾನಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. \nಇದು ಪ್ರತಿಭಟನೆಯ ಕಥೆ ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ. ಬದಲಾವಣೆಗೆ ಕರೆ ನೀಡಿದ ಬಳಿಕ\, ಆದರ್ಶಗಳು ವಾಸ್ತವಿಕತೆಯನ್ನು ಎದುರಿಸಿದಾಗ ಏನಾಗುತ್ತದೆ ಎಂಬುದರ ಕಥೆ. ಭವನೆ\, ವಿನೋದ ಮತ್ತು ನಿಷ್ಠುರ ಪ್ರಾಮಾಣಿಕತೆಯೊಂದಿಗೆ\, ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ ಬಂತು #ಕ್ರಾಂತಿ ವೈಯಕ್ತಿಕ ಹಾಗು ರಾಜಕೀಯ ಕ್ರಾಂತಿಯನ್ನು ನೋಡಲು ಎಲ್ಲರನ್ನೂ ಸ್ವಾಗತಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. \nKranthi Banthu #Kranthi is a powerful reimagining of P. Lankesh’s 1971 play Kranthi Banthu Kranthi\, brought into the present by Team Kalavilasi. Though decades have passed\, the heart of the struggles still ring true today: inequality\, power\, and the fight for justice. The timeless thread of revolution makes this adaptation both familiar and fresh. \nKranthi Banthu #Kranthi explores how young people respond when their voices are drowned out\, how influencers and media twist stories for gain\, and how chaos can spread in a world overloaded with opinions. Through sharp satire and thoughtful humor\, the play invites the audience to reflect and question. \nThe characters\, each driven by their own sense of what is right and wrong\, move through a world shaped by capitalist control\, media manipulation\, and social unrest. They find themselves caught in nuances of the very system they hoped to change. Their choices reflect our own questions about truth\, power\, and resistance. \nThis is more than a story of protest. It’s about what happens after the call for change\, when ideals meet reality. With heart\, wit\, and bold honesty\, Kranthi Banthu #Kranthi welcomes all to witness a revolution both personal and political. \nCast and Crew | ತಾರಾಗಣ ಮತ್ತು ತಾಂತ್ರಿಕ ಬಳಗ: \nVaishnavi | ವೈಷ್ಣವಿ\nMadhukar Hirisave | ಮಧುಕರ್ ಹಿರಿಸಾವೆ\nSiddaramu K | ⁠ಸಿದ್ದರಾಮು ಕೆ\nNamitha Ramu | ⁠ನಮಿತಾ ರಾಮು\nPallavi Hegde | ⁠ಪಲ್ಲವಿ ಹೆಗಡೆ\nHarsha Vardhan | ⁠ಹರ್ಷ ವರ್ಧನ್\nNarayan Badiger | ನಾರಾಯಣ್ ಬಡಿಗೇರ್\nNagaraj | ನಾಗರಾಜ್\nSuhas Srinivas | ಸುಹಾಸ್ ಶ್ರೀನಿವಾಸ್\nAbhishek Chakrannavar | ಅಭಿಷೇಕ ಚಕ್ರಣ್ಣವರ\nAbhinav Iyengar | ಅಭಿನವ್ ಅಯ್ಯಂಗಾರ್ \nBackground Music | ಹಿನ್ನೆಲೆ ಸಂಗೀತ : Sathya Radhakrishna | ಸತ್ಯ ರಾಧಾಕೃಷ್ಣ\nLighting Design | ಬೆಳಕು ವಿನ್ಯಾಸ : Manju Narayan | ಮಂಜು ನಾರಾಯಣ & Surya | ಸೂರ್ಯ\nCo-ordinator | ರಂಗ ನಿರ್ವಹಣೆ : Basavaraj Emmiyavar | ಬಸವರಾಜ ಎಮ್ಮಿಯವರ \n\n\nSupported by:\n\n

SUMMARY:The Law Strikes Back
DESCRIPTION:Mumbai in the seventies and eighties was a city of sharp contrasts: glamour and gang wars\, chaos and control. At the heart of it all was Assistant Commissioner of Police (Retd) Madhukar B. Zende\, a sharp-minded officer with a knack for catching the city’s most elusive criminals. \nBest known for arresting the infamous serial killer Charles Sobhraj\, aka the Serpent\, Zende’s career spanned decades of high-stakes policing. His new book\, Mumbai’s Most Wanted\, is a rich and gritty chronicle of life on the force. \nFrom the mysterious murder of Shanta Devi to the capture of criminal kingpins like Arun Gawli\, Karim Lala\, Haji Mastan and Babu Reshim\, his stories unfold like scenes from a noir thriller (except every word is true). There are riots\, manhunts\, and moments of doubt as well as unexpected grace. \nThis conversation is a rare look into a city in flux and a man who walked its fault lines\, chasing justice in a time of smoke-filled bars\, typewriters\, and quick decisions. \nFor those who wish to engage further\, a Q&A with the supercop himself will follow the discussion. \n

SUMMARY:Dvaita | Duality
DESCRIPTION:Contradictions\, comparison and ultimately confluence\, Dvaita | Duality is a fusion of artistic expression and philosophical inquiry. Through two distinct dance forms\, Kuchipudi and Balinese\, the dynamic balance of opposing energies is beautifully displayed. \nCentred around ‘Ardhanareeswara’\, the composite form of Shiva-Shakti\, the dance visualises the distinct yet complementary nature of the masculine and feminine energies. A layered performance\, this piece explores the philosophical questions of how our consciousness (Purusha) interacts with the material world (Prakriti). \nThis evening aspires to resolve the paradox of opposites not through negotiation\, but harmonious expression. \nCredits: \nConcept\, Creation and Artistic Direction: Gomathi Boorada \nDancers:\nGomathi Boorada\nJesitta Jilju\nNeharika Renjith Nair\nHemali Subramanyam Boorada\nAlphonsa Ashwajit Kamble\nSneha Chandrababu\nGoutham Maheswaran\n⁠Ni Putu Widiantini\n⁠Ni Wayan Pia Wahyuni\n⁠Ni Komang Erna Sriwahyuni\n⁠Ni Kadek Santi Wiadnyani \nMusic:\nI Wayan Sudirana / Gamelan Yugananda\nD.S.V.

SUMMARY:Kailash-Manasarovar
DESCRIPTION:For centuries\, Tibet has remained a land of mystery. Though sacred to millions\, Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar were still wrapped in myth as recent as the 1900’s. This session retraces the journey of two travelers\, a Swedish explorer and an Indian ascetic\, whose visits illuminated the mythical and sacred Kailash-Manasarovar region in Tibet. \nBetween 1907 and 1909\, Swedish explorer Sven Hedin mapped the region. He traced the sources of the three great rivers – the Brahmaputra\, Indus\, and Sutlej – and became the first European to walk around Mount Kailash. Three decades later\, Indian monk Swami Pranavananda arrived in the region. He offered a fresh view\, challenging Hedin’s identification of the rivers’ sources\, offering\, for the first time\, an informed Asian perspective on Tibet’s geography. \nThis visually rich talk brings their stories to life. Rare archival material\, contemporary photos\, and new research reveal how these journeys shaped our understanding of a sacred landscape. \nThe Q&A after the session offers room for your participation – whether curious about history\, travel\, or spirituality. \n

SUMMARY:The Gauri Files
DESCRIPTION:Journalism. Politics. Justice.  \nOne fateful evening in 2017\, journalist Gauri Lankesh was shot outside her Bangalore home. Her death sent shockwaves across the country. But the story didn’t end there. \nThis evening with journalist and author Rollo Romig\, as he explores in his powerful new book\, I Am on the Hit List\, offers new insights into the life and assassination of Gauri Lankesh. In conversation with artist Pushpamala N and writer-activist Shivsundar\, Romig shares the years of reporting and investigating that led him deep into the world Gauri inhabited. \nThrough hidden archives\, political undercurrents\, and voices from the ground\, Romig uncovers a chilling rise in hate and extremism. From Bangalore’s storied publishing lanes to secretive religious enclaves\, this conversation offers a rare and moving look at India’s shifting democratic landscape.  \nPull up a chair. Because remembering is resistance\, and this is a story that needs to be heard. \n

SUMMARY:Kadahin Milandaasin
DESCRIPTION:Experience an unforgettable evening of music and memory with a special vinyl listening session of Kadahin Milandaasin\, the acclaimed album by drummer and composer Tarun Balani. Called “a sonic love letter to Sindh” by The Hindu\, this deeply personal work has been featured on NPR’s Best Jazz Albums and Bandcamp’s Best of Jazz. \nInspired by the life of Balani’s late grandfather\, K.S. Balani\, a renowned Sindhi writer and painter\, the album explores themes of migration\, ancestral memory\, and identity. Through moving compositions and layered soundscapes\, Kadahin Milandaasin becomes both a tribute and a journey home. \nThe evening includes a full vinyl playback of the album\, followed by an intimate conversation with Tarun Balani himself. Join us for a rare chance to hear the stories behind the music: of love\, loss\, and legacy.  \nAbout BIC Elsewhere: \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur\, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations\, arts\, and culture directly to diverse audiences. Through this initiative\, we collaborate with various venues\, extending the reach of our events beyond our own space.

SUMMARY:Folie à Deux
DESCRIPTION:Folie à Deux \nSome connections run so deep\, they blur the line between two minds\, two lives\, until they begin to move as one. Folie à Deux\, French for “a shared madness” or “shared state of mind\,” captures this rare intimacy. \nThe program features two evocative contemporary dance solos: “3 AM” and “Nobody Cares.” Together\, these performances invite you into that in-between space where stories overlap\, emotions echo\, and movement speaks what words often cannot. \nTitle: Nobody Cares \nIn “Nobody Cares\,” Deepak Kurki confronts identity in a world shaped by contradiction. His piece explores the dissonance of social labels and inherited expectations of an individual born in a Hindu family\, raised in a Muslim neighborhood\, and educated in a Catholic school. Through raw\, physical language\, Deepak questions the systems that define us—and the quiet resistance that emerges from within. \nCredits: \nChoreographed & Performed by Deepak Kurki Shivaswamy \nMusic: Abhijeet Tambe \nDuration: 30 minutes \nTitle: 3 AM \nIn “3 AM\,” Prashant More takes us into the restless mind of an insomniac. The piece traces the delicate edge between exhaustion and wakefulness—a world where time dissolves\, and the mind spirals through memory\, anxiety\, and longing. It’s a quiet\, surreal portrait of sleeplessness\, told through a body caught in motion while desperately searching for stillness. \nCredits: \nChoreography and Performance: Prashant More Music: Nikhil Nagaraj \nDuration: 35 minutes \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Ferdinand Kittel's Life and Works
DESCRIPTION:The Word and the Teacher / ಅರಿವು ಮತ್ತು ಗುರುವು / Das Wort und Der Lehrer\n80 mins |  English\, Kannada\, & German with English subtitles | 2023 | India\, Germany \n  \nRev. Ferdinand Kittel (1832 – 1903) was a missionary from Germany\, who spent 50 years of his life between India and Germany on his work as a writer\, translator\, linguist and lexicographer. This period film takes up the journey of his monumental work in the fields of lexicography and philology. Despite many challenges\, he mastered the Kannada language and created a huge dictionary and thesaurus unparalleled in any Indian language. He also taught in schools and produced more than 40 scholarly works. \nThis tri-lingual\, non-fiction film is shot in locations where Kittel lived and worked both in southern India and Germany\, and its first person narration uses his letters to his children in Germany\, and letters and reports to superiors. It includes archival photographs dating back to the early 19th century\, folk songs and poems written and translated by Kittel\, and Old Kannada literature. The film has been shown in different parts of Switzerland\, Germany & India. \nDuring the production of the film\, one of the early print typefaces of Kannada\, pioneered by Kittel and cast in Europe was digitised by the filmmaker\, Prashant Pandit\, and an open-source font in the name of Kittel was released for public use. This font was extensively used in the books published during the 1860s. The film also uses this font in the displayed texts. \nImage Credit\nHeader: Erstwhile Basel Mission Printing Press\, Mangaluru\, a still from the film\, The Word and the Teacher. Ferdinand Kittel supervised the publication of numerous books at the Press. \nProduction Crew:\nDirector\, Writer & Editor – Prashant Pandit\nCinematography – Chidanand GL & Florina Steiner\nSound – Anand V & Mahaveer S \n

SUMMARY:Freedom and Integrity
DESCRIPTION:There are many different views on what it means to be free. One popular perspective sees freedom as a form of independence: being free means not being held back or restricted by the expectations\, obligations\, or interference from others. After explaining the basic idea in more detail\, the talk discusses Bob Dylan’s work to illustrate the value of this kind of freedom while noting that some other parts of Dylan’s work seem to question this very idea of freedom. To explore the critique of freedom\, the talk turns to Robert Musil’s (1880-1942) unfinished novel The Man Without Qualities. One way to understand this celebrated novel is to see it as a partly hilarious\, partly deeply tragic and moving description of putting too much emphasis on an ideal of freedom as independence. Drawing on insights from moral philosophy\, the talk suggests that a proper understanding of the relation between independence and personal integrity can lead to a better appreciation of freedom as independence. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the lecture. \nThis lecture is a part of Vidyashilp University’s Public Lecture Series. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:गीर्वाण वाणी -BHARATHI
DESCRIPTION:Step into a heartfelt journey across time and tradition. In this special performance\, the untouched poetic gems of Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharathiyar are brought to life\, exploring the vision and passion behind words he once held close. \nOur story begins with the late Prof. K. V. Krishnan from Varanasi\, Bharathiyar’s own nephew\, whose lifelong love for his uncle’s work unearthed these hidden verses. Through his research\, we glimpse Bharathiyar not only as a poet but as a dreamer\, lighting fires of change. \nThe name Bharathi\, born of the Sanskrit “Abhāyām + Ratah”\, means “one who delights in fearlessness.” This performance honors him as a beacon of courage\, his words as arms of inspiration. \nThis evening offers a warm celebration of dance and verse; a simple yet powerful tribute to our fiery national poet\, whose voice still stirs hearts today. \nCredits \nMusic Direction – Dr. Rajkumar Bharathi\nVocal & Nattuvangam – Swati Athmanathan\nMridangam\, Tabla & Voiceover – Sri.

SUMMARY:Perfect Days
DESCRIPTION:123 minutes | Japanese with English subtitles | Japan | 2023 \nWriter & Director: Wim Wenders\nScriptwriter: Takuma Takasaki\nStarring: Koji Yakusho\, Tokio Emoto\, Arisa Nakano\, Aoi Yamada\, and others.\nComposer: Patrick Watson \nThe highly anticipated return to fiction feature filmmaking from Wim Wenders (Paris\, Texas\, Wings of Desire)\, Perfect Days takes the seasoned writer-director to Tokyo to tell a story celebrating the hidden joys and minutiae of Japanese culture. \nIn a deeply moving performance that won the Best Actor award at Cannes 2023\, Koji Yakusho (Babel\, 13 Assassins) stars as Hirayama\, a contemplative middle-aged man who lives a life of modesty and serenity\, spending his days balancing his job as a dutiful caretaker of Tokyo’s numerous public toilets with his passion for music\, literature and photography. As we join him on his structured daily routine\, a series of unexpected encounters gradually begin to reveal a hidden past that lies behind his otherwise content and harmonious life. \nChanneling Wenders’ affection for the work of Yasujiro Ozu\, and combining a refreshingly unstereotypical depiction of the Japanese capital – particularly the experience of typically unappreciated service work – with a soundtrack of iconic hits from the 60s and 80s\, this is a subtle\, shimmering and ultimately life-affirming marvel that champions the meditative beauty of the everyday world around us. Nominated for the Best International Film award at the 96th Academy Awards. \nWim Wenders\, born in 1945\, rose to international prominence in the 1970s as a pioneer of New German Cinema and remains a key figure in contemporary film. His multifaceted career spans award-winning feature films\, innovative documentaries\, photography\, and writing. After studying at the University of Television and Film Munich and working as a film critic\, he co-founded the Filmverlag der Autoren to support independent German auteur films. His early road movie trilogy explored post-war German identity\, leading to international acclaim with The American Friend (1977). Wenders has since earned numerous global honors\, including the Golden Palm at Cannes for Paris\, Texas and Oscar nominations for documentaries like Buena Vista Social Club and Pina. \nThis is the second film in our collaboration with MUBI. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience! \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Three Geniuses from a Little Town
DESCRIPTION:In Karnatik music\, a composer is referred to as a ‘vaggeyakara’ – someone who creates both the text (vak) and the music (geya) for a composition. The kirtana is the most important compositional form in Karnatik music. It is a beautiful balance between the sahitya (text)\, raga (melody) and tala (rhythm). These kirtanas have sprung from the creative flow of melody and text\, thus creating a unified aesthetic identity.  \nThree eighteenth-century composers\, Thyagaraja (1767-1847)\, Muthusvami Dikshithar (1775-1835) and Shyama Shastri (1762-1827)\, were masters and innovators of this compositional form\, reverentially referred to as the ‘Trinity’ of Karnatik music. \nThe oldest among the three\, Shyama Shastri\, composed fewer compositions than his other two contemporaries\, but each one of his compositions stand out as a unique piece. He used complex rhythmic structures which give a special quality to his kirtanas. \nThe prolific composer Thyagaraja viewed ragas with utmost clarity and definition. In his kirtanas\, you find defined nuggets of the raga’s phrases in almost every line. \nThe esoteric Muthusvami Dikshithar looked at a composition with a different lens. His kirtanas are one whole melodic movement where the raga flows in an unstructured manner\, overflowing from one line to another. The deeper one dwells on his compositions\, their beauty unravels. \nAt this concert\, Sangeetha Sivakumar will be presenting compositions of the Trinity with a special focus on Muthusvami Dikshithar since we are celebrating his 250th birth anniversary this year. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Peace Notes - An Evening at the Opera
DESCRIPTION:Experience the drama\, passion\, and romance of opera in a concert featuring timeless masterpieces from Bizet’s Carmen\, Verdi’s La Traviata\, and Gounod’s Romeo and Juliet! \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra will be led by India-born Danish conductor Maria Badstue\, and joined by stellar soloists—Indian-American tenor Alok Kumar and soprano Cheryl Bains. This concert brings the emotional power of grand opera to life in Bengaluru. \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra brings together talented musicians from across the region to foster peace and unity through music. Inspired by Ambassador Nirupama Menon Rao’s extensive years in diplomacy\, the orchestra provides a platform to promote dialogue\, cultural synergy\, and friendly understanding. \nNirupama Rao\, Founder/ Trustee of The South Asian Symphony Foundation says\, “There is something profoundly symbolic about an orchestra. It is more than a group of musicians gathered to perform a piece of music; it is a living metaphor for what society could be — and perhaps what it must be\, if we are to thrive together… This metaphor becomes even more powerful in today’s world\, where individualism often overshadows community\, and noise threatens to replace music. The orchestra reminds us that true greatness lies not in volume\, but in harmony — in listening\, adapting\, and playing our part with care and respect.” \n \n  \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n      \n
