DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: 11:00 am | Friday\, 15 August\nTimings: 11:00 am – 8:00 pm\nExhibition on show until Wednesday\, 20 August \nWalkthroughs:\nFri\, Aug 15 | 5:30 pm\nSat\, Aug 16 | 12:00 pm & 5:30 pm\nSun\, Aug 17 | 12:00 pm & 5:30 pm\nMon\, Aug 18 | 12:00 pm & 5:30 pm\nTue\, Aug 19 | 12:00 pm & 5:30 pm\nWed\, Aug 20 | 12:00pm \nPanel Discussion:\nHandlooms—Past\, Present and Future: Fri\, 15 Aug | 11:30 am – 1 pm\nLaila Tyabji\, Ratna Krishna Kumar\, Nandita Das\, Chandra Jain & Shoba Narayan\nRSVP here \nRiver Weaves: Brocades of Banaras offers an immersive experience. \nBanarasi brocade isn’t any old textile\, but rather a living archive of artistry\, memory\, and devotion. River Weaves invites you into this world\, where each thread tells a story of beauty shaped by generations of skill. \nConceived by craft champion Chandra Jain and brought to life by Siddhartha Das Studio\, this immersive exhibition explores the richness of Banaras handloom tradition. From luminous motifs echoing Mughal gardens and temple carvings\, to rare sarees dyed with natural pigments after 125 years\, River Weaves traces a powerful journey of revival. \nThe exhibition moves beyond finished fabrics to reveal the unseen labour (degumming\, spinning\, dyeing\, weaving) and centres the voices of the weavers who have quietly and dutifully carried this tradition forward for centuries. \nBut this legacy faces a fragile future. With fewer artisans able to continue and the next generation drifting away\, the craft stands at a crossroads. River Weaves holds space for reflection\, and more importantly\, for hope. \nThe exhibition is guided by Chandra Jain’s vision and decades-long dedication to reviving Indian handloom traditions. Curated by Chiara Nath and Siddhartha Das of Siddhartha Das Studio\, an award-winning\, multi-disciplinary practice known for powerful storytelling of cultural heritage. Their design showcases each Banarasi brocade on display as a tribute not only to exquisite design\, but to a way of life rooted in patience\, precision\, and pride. \nThis event is far more than your average exhibition. It is a call to action. For if we do not celebrate our traditional crafts\, who will? \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Piravi | The Birth
DESCRIPTION:103 minutes | Malayalam with English subtitles | 1989 | Shaji N Karun \nOne man waits by the river. Every morning\, every evening. The bus never comes. \nPiravi (The Birth) is a quiet\, devastating meditation on loss\, hope\, and the personal toll of political violence. Based on the life of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier\, Piravi is an intimate elegy for a missing son and a father’s unyielding prayer. With unforgettable performances from Lakshmi Krishnamoorthy and Archana\, the film has earned nearly 30 international awards\, standing as a poignant reminder of how political tragedies are always deeply\, painfully personal. \nInspired by the real-life story of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier\, whose son disappeared during India’s Emergency in 1976 while studying at the Regional Engineering College in Calicut\, Piravi captures the slow unraveling of a family consumed by grief. It is a heartrending portrayal of personal loss and the impact of political oppression. \nKarun’s directorial debut film will be introduced by filmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini\, who will also moderate the post-screening Q&A. \nNote: This special screening opens a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G. Aravindan and cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun – both of whom we remember with great reverence. BIC aims to pay homage to the iconic duo\, and the Parallel Cinema movement they pioneered\, through the screening of two films bound by their unique\, shared cinematic vision. Read more about the second film in their tribute here.\n \n

SUMMARY:Acts of Attention
DESCRIPTION:A poet’s prerogative is to witness life. \nSiddhartha Menon’s poetry belongs to a modern practice\, going back to around 1900\, of creating poems through spells of intense attention to non-human life for its own sake. This evening will begin with a conversation between Menon and Prashant Keshavmurthy on how two of Menon’s six poem collections – The Compass Bird (2023) and Lone Pine (2025) – relate to this modern poetic practice. Together\, they’ll trace the lineage of a quiet but radical poetic tradition that resists metaphor\, transcends language\, and pulls attention. \nWhile the natural world has always been a favourite muse of the human mind\, select poets have found powerful anecdotes to draw their readers in. Pushing past the self-centred gaze so familiar to us\, the lyrical observations of this style asks us to witness the fascinating creatures with whom we share this world.  \nClosing with a Q&A open to the audience\, this event promises insights\, inspiration\, and immersion. \n

SUMMARY:Thampu | The Circus Tent
DESCRIPTION:130 minutes | Malayalam with English subtitles | 1978 | G Aravindan \nA circus tent rises by the river\, and with it a world both real and imagined. \nThampu (The Circus Tent) is a luminous blend of documentary and fiction\, capturing the arrival of a travelling circus to a quiet village on the banks of Kerala’s Bharatapuzha river. Featuring real circus performers\, local villagers\, and a cast of non-actors\, the film becomes a portrait of the everyday lives that unfold around a spectacle. \nDirected by G. Aravindan and shot by Shaji N. Karun\, Thampu marked the second collaboration between two of Indian cinema’s most visionary artists. Filmed in stark black and white on a modest budget\, it is a masterclass in restraint and imagination. Every frame holds the weight of directorial decisions: what is showcased\, and what is obscured. \nRecently restored by the Film Heritage Foundation and digitised by the National Film Archive of India\, Thampu has been rediscovered by global audiences. From the Cannes Classics to the British Film Institute’s Treasures segment\, and most recently at the Festival of 3 Continents in Nantes\, its revival is a tribute to Aravindan’s enduring cinematic voice. \nFilmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini will introduce the film and moderate a post-screening Q&A. \nNote: This special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G. Aravindan and cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun – both of whom we remember with great reverence. BIC aims to pay homage to the iconic duo\, and the Parallel Cinema movement they pioneered\, through the screening of two films bound by their unique\, shared cinematic vision.

SUMMARY:Kalatra: The Eternal Consort
DESCRIPTION:At the edge of legend and longing\, two women wait for the same god. \nKalatra is a dance-theatre work by Keelaka Dance Company that reimagines the story of Murugan and his two consorts (Valli and Devanai) not as divine footnotes\, but as women bound by love\, rivalry\, and fate. In the classical Hindu tradition\, Murugan’s union with both is a symbol of completeness\, of sacred balance. But in Sri Lanka’s local poetic lore\, a quieter\, more human story unfolds. \nThe journey begins in Kataragama\, where Murugan is worshipped not just by Hindus\, but by Buddhists\, Muslims\, and indigenous tribes. Each finds a reflection of their own devotion in his form. Here\, the story of Valli takes root\, even as the shrine of Devanai turns away. Locals say she cannot bear to see her lord walk each night to Valli’s side. \nBlending Bharatanatyam and contemporary dance\, Kalatra draws from mythology\, regional poetry\, and imagined memory. Presented by the Keelaka Dance Company\, conceived by Jyotsna Shourie and Aneesha Grover\, with music by Daniel B George\, OS Arun\, and Madstarbase. \nA performance where myth breathes\, and devotion speaks! \nIn Collaboration with: \n \n  \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Tipu’s Tiger & the Empire’s Trophy Room
DESCRIPTION:Far from home\, polished and perched\, lie countless Indian artefacts.  \nStories of their acquisition\, passed down through generations\, often obscure the brutal realities of conquest\, coercion and plunder. Taken as prized trophies during colonial rule\, these objects have sat in museums and private collections for centuries.  \nIn this talk\, journalist and author Shyam Bhatia brings a deeply personal story to light: the journey of a centuries-old Indian artefact passed down through a British military family. Through this single heirloom\, he opens up the layered questions of cultural memory\, ownership\, and the unfinished business of historical justice. \nFollowing the talk\, Bhatia will be in conversation with art historian and curator Dr Arnika Ahldag\, exploring the roles institutions and individuals play in shaping and restoring the narratives of the past. \nThis evening invites reflection\, curiosity\, and conversation that lingers beyond the final word. Bring your questions to the audience Q&A at the end of the session!  \n

SUMMARY:Dual Margam 5
DESCRIPTION:When rhythm takes flight and grace stands still\, something timeless begins to move. \nOn our next evening of Dual Margam\, two powerful classical traditions come together in a rare conversation of contrast and convergence. The soaring\, drum-led dynamism of Pung Cholom from Manipur\, and the grounded\, sculptural flow of Odissi from Odisha. \nTraditionally\, in Pung Cholom\, dancers become percussionists: leaping\, spinning\, and drumming in mid-air with ecstatic energy and astonishing control. In contrast\, Odissi unfolds in slow\, sinuous arcs\, where each gesture and every glance evokes poetry\, myth\, and devotion. \nIn this special performance\, the two rhythmic traditions of Pung Cholom and Odissi are interwoven and contrasted: bringing fire to form\, and pulse to poetry as the dances come together with complementary aesthetics. \nThe first in a two-part Odissi-Manipuri conversation\, this evening unfolds through two male bodies and will be revisited next month through the feminine form. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam)\, while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Pooja Kunita
DESCRIPTION:Pooja Kunita is a moving act of devotion where acrobatics meet ritual\, and every step carries a prayer. Rooted in the folk traditions of Mandya\, this vibrant performance is a celebration of spiritual connection\, ancestral memory\, and communal joy. \nPresented by Sri Vinayaka Yuvakara Kala Balaga and led by K.B. Swamy\, the 60-minute experience invites audiences into a mesmerising journey from its richly symbolic beginnings to its breathtaking finale. A traditional Sutradar sets the stage\, guiding us through the hallowed history\, cultural context\, and ceremonial gestures that shape this living art form. \nAs sacred chants rise and prayer frames are adorned\, the performance builds with the pulse of the traditional rhythms of the Tamte\, Tarsi and Nagarai. In a truly immersive experience\, the audience will be taught hejjes (traditional dance steps) before the final performance.  \nIn a culmination of prayer and performance\, this event offers a unique chance to connect with a living tradition. \nThis is the fourth performance of our series BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka’s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India\, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression. Through demonstrations\, performances\, and academic discussions\, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Kaveri River
DESCRIPTION:Maya Jayapal’s book\, Kaveri: The Journey of a River\, traces the author’s journey down the Kaveri river\, with her father in the first half\, and alone in the second half\, after he passed. With charming illustrations by Rohit Bhasi\, the book takes the reader from Talakaveri to Poompuhar with historical and religious sites\, people\, culture\, flora and fauna\, and much more along the way. \nThe author of two books on Bangalore\, one on Djakarta and one on Singapore\, cities where she has lived\, Maya Jayapal says\, “I chose to write my story of a river as I got tired of writing about cities. I had just finished writing about Bangalore which is changing too rapidly for my liking. I wanted to discover something more natural\, something more ancient\, something that had been an inspiration for civilisations\, something that embodied life eternal\, life giving and life sustaining. And so\, I chose a river\, a river that flows in my own backyard\, so to speak.” \n  \nImage Credit\nBook cover illustration by Rohit Bhasi.  \n  \nPresented by the Jayapal family \n

And few cities have been captured on screen with as much intimacy and complexity as Bombay.  \nIn this evocative lecture\, film scholar Ranjani Mazumdar explores the layered portrait of the city as seen in films like Ritesh Batra’s Lunch Box (2013) and Photograph (2019)\, Milind Dhaimade’s Tu Hai Mera Sunday (2016)\, Kiran Rao’s Dhobi Ghat (2010)\, and Rohena Gera’s Sir (2018).  \nThrough quiet details\, fading memories\, and the rhythm of everyday life\, these films map a metropolis that is both deeply personal and constantly changing. With her deep insight into cinema\, technology\, and urban life\, Mazumdar traces how filmmakers evoke the city’s past and present while imagining its future.  \nThe event concludes with a Q&A\, offering space for reflection and conversation. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University’s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Ramachandram Bhavayami
DESCRIPTION:Ramachandram Bhavayami brings to life the rare and powerful women of the Ramayana\, figures of immense strength\, influence\, and devotion\, each deeply impacted by Rama’s actions yet honoring him with unwavering loyalty. \nThrough a unique blend of Bharatanatyam and spoken narration\, the performance reimagines their voices\, offering fresh insights into Rama Bhakti\, resilience\, and love. \nOne highlight is Ramya Ramnarayan’s striking portrayal of Soorpanakha. A masked\, dramatically attired figure enters with bold\, expressive movement in Thakkukku Dhikkukku (Adi). Her first sight of Rama (Lavanya Rama\, Tyagaraja) is rendered with poignant music\, delicate violin\, and a compelling mix of desire\, wonder\, and vulnerability. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Mozart Requiem
DESCRIPTION:About the centrepiece of the evening – Requiem in D minor K. 626 \nMozart’s Requiem is a choral masterpiece whose genesis is shrouded in mystery – one that makes the piece even more fascinating and emotionally stirring. Mozart was not in the best state of mind when he received an anonymous commission to compose a Requiem Mass. His health was deteriorating\, and he believed he had been cursed to write a requiem as a ‘swansong’ for himself\, because he was sure he was about to die. It was in early July 1791 that an ‘unknown\, gray stranger’ turned up at the composer’s door saying he represented someone who wanted a Requiem from Mozart on the understanding that he does not seek to learn the identity of his patron. Spooked by the commission\, Mozart threw himself obsessively into the work. But it was all too much. He was only able to complete the Requiem and Kyrie movements and managed to sketch the voice parts and bass lines for the Dies Irae through to the Hostias.  \nMozart died aged 35 on 5 December 1791\, before he could complete the work. Payment had already been received\, and Mozart’s widow Constanze feared that if the work was handed over incomplete\, the patron would want his money back. Mozart’s pupil Süssmayer\, to whom the composer had given detailed instructions about finishing it\, completed the unfinished movements. Süssmayer copied the entire completed score in his own hand – making it virtually impossible to determine who wrote what – and gave it to the stranger. So was the ‘mysterious stranger’ Mozart’s rival Antonio Salieri\, much slandered villain of the film Amadeus? Almost certainly not. It was Anton Leitgeb\, son of the mayor of Vienna and the valet of Count Franz von Walsegg-Stuppach\, who already had acquired the reputation of palming other people’s music off as his own. The Count was hoping to use Mozart’s Requiem to commemorate his late wife\, Anna. It took a full decade before Constanze was able to persuade Walsegg to acknowledge Mozart as the Requiem’s true composer. Regardless of who wrote which parts of the Requiem\, it still sounds wonderful to most of us.  \nAnd let us give Beethoven the final word on the matter: ‘If Mozart did not write the music\, then the man who wrote it was a Mozart.’ \n \n  \nImage Credit:\nThumbnail and Poster: Portrait of Mozart from the Berliner Philharmoniker Digital Concert Hall \n  \nIn collaboration with: \n        \nPresented by the International Music and Arts Society \n \nSupported by Furtados and Steinway \n       \n

SUMMARY:مقدس سفر | Holy Rights
DESCRIPTION:53 minutes | Urdu with English subtitles | 2020 | India \nAs a woman’s faith becomes her fire\, what can stand in her way? \nIn the heart of Bhopal\, where tradition runs deep and silence often surrounds resistance\, Safia\, a devout Muslim woman\, quietly begins a revolution. When her husband invokes triple talaq and divorces her in her own absence\, she turns to seek justice.  \nHoly Rights is an intimate\, unflinching documentary tracing Safia’s courageous journey as she navigates uncharted territory\, confronting resistance and reshaping narratives that profoundly impact women’s lives. She challenges centuries of patriarchal tradition by training to become a Qazi – an interpreter and authority of Islamic personal law. Her decision\, rooted in faith and a deep sense of justice\, sets in motion a ripple effect among other Muslim women\, who begin to reimagine their place in both religion and society. \nThe film unfolds over four years capturing landmark political shifts\, the fight against the practice of triple talaq\, and the quiet courage of women who refuse to be spoken for by religious authorities\, political actors\, or even well-meaning allies. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with filmmaker Farha Khatun and producer Priyanka More\, who will be joining us online\, and a Q&A with the audience. \nHere is the trailer of the film. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:And\, Salt to Taste
DESCRIPTION:Haven’t we all been to enough discussions where we have felt\, “If only the moderator asked more interesting questions!” Whether it is a book launch\, a post-screening chat with a filmmaker or a panel discussion on issues that matter to us\, the role of the moderator is a critical but often taken-for-granted ingredient. A good moderator has a point of view and – like ‘salt to taste’ in any dish – makes the conversation deep\, engaging and participative. Good moderators build context\, make delicate – sometimes pointed – enquiries\, navigate difficult terrains\, potential conflicts and uncomfortable truths with grace and humour\, all the while maintaining the integrity and forward momentum of the conversation. They also assess the temperature and shifting temperament of the room\, and strive to be the audience’s representative\, in turn challenging and coaxing those they are conversing with. \nIn this interactive workshop participants will explore various tools and techniques that will enable them to learn how to become an effective and critical moderator. Through exercises\, group discussions and feedback\, the workshop will impart practical knowledge on styles and strategies participants can choose from to suit both their personalities as well as the needs of a particular discussion. Finally\, it will also provide tips to build confidence and cope with the last minute butterflies-in-the-stomach that is the worry of anyone who has ever – or never – walked onto a stage! \nIf you are keen on building a safe and inclusive space\, and respectful and inspiring conversations\, if you have an opinion but are interested in engaging with others’\, if you are – or want to be – moderate in truth\, temperate in style and obdurate in quest\, then this workshop is for you. \n

SUMMARY:Ganga Maiya
DESCRIPTION:It was as only as recent as 2016 on a visit to the Dhrupad Mela in Benares that the Esperanto project discovered the mystical beauty of the river Ganga and the ghats of the world’s oldest living city and have been since mesmerised by its spirit and are visiting annually. \nThe connect with the peace pervading the banks of the Ganga has given rise to new music and they have been inspired to create a new bouquet of music. This album is named ‘Boat on the River’ a mystical representation of human life as a living\, loving boat\, that floats on forever. \nThis music in turn serendipitously connected them with the famous artist from Kolkata Asit Poddar who has also been visiting Benares and painting many works based on his muse awakened there. The paintings and music combine in music videos to express a glimpse of the mystique of Ganga Maiya. The album is proposed to be released at the Kala Yatra festival at Kashi on march 8\, 2024. The group have embarked on a journey to share this experience around India and worldwide. They now conduct Art &amp; Music Festivals on the Benares Ghats and other cities called Kala Yatri. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Storytelling Theatre Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Storytelling is as old as mankind itself. In recent years there has been a resurgence in Storytelling\, applying the narrative process in a wide range of settings\, drawing from a variety of origins: in therapy\, in community development\, in toastmasters clubs\, in management\, in personal growth labs and so on. It may well become something of a bandwagon soon. \nBangalore Little Theatre (BLT) has developed a unique genre of storytelling theatre\, presenting fully rehearsed performances\, but in storytelling format. It is called the Courtyard programme. The main features of the programme are:\n– Performances in a variety of spaces\, not necessarily a stage\n– Usually smaller numbers\, in intimate surroundings\n– Typically two actors – even one as sometimes done\n– No staging requirements of sets\, costumes\, lights\, etc. Just good performance! \nWhat will not be easily seen about Storytelling Theatre is that it requires a specialized approach to content and scripting and\, therefore\, a specialized technique in performance. Those who have seen BLT performances such as Robi’s Garden and Shakespeare By Any Other Name will understand this readily. \nStorytelling Theatre in India is a relatively new form that is still evolving. Participants in the workshop will be contributing to its development. \nWho is this workshop for? \nThis workshop is meant for those who are already well into the theatre arts and are committed to future work in either theatre making or performance\, but with a special interest in Storytelling Theatre. It is not meant for mere “orientation” or armchair exploration. It will be a doing workshop\, covering such objectives as:\n– To examine and appreciate different forms of Storytelling\n– To look at the special needs of storytelling theatre\n– To explore the unique skill sets needed in the actor for the above – in body\, voice and mind\n– To make a beginning in creating a community of theatre storytellers\, committed to developing the form.\n– The last objective is significant. It is accepted that there can be a limited amount of coverage in a two-day workshop. We hope to continue as a community of storytelling theatre makers. \nPlease note: The workshop will be for a limited number of participants. All interested in the workshop are requested to register early. BIC reserves the right to finalize the list of participants. There will be no walk-in registrations at the workshop.  \n
