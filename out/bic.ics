SUMMARY:EMIs & Other Existential Crises
DESCRIPTION:In this refreshingly jargon-free session\, Lavanya Mohan\, author of Money Doesn’t Grow on Trees\, gets real about why personal finance often feels confusing\, boring\, or just plain overwhelming. \nFrom spending in your 20s to planning in your 40s\, Lavanya’s approach is simple\, meme-filled\, and judgment-free. Whether you’re dealing with your first paycheck\, lifestyle creep\, or just trying to adult responsibly\, this conversation covers how to spend smarter at every life stage—without spreadsheets or guilt. \nLavanya will be in conversation with Dipika Jaikishan\, Co-Founder and COO of Basis\, a platform focused on financial independence for women. Together\, with their understanding of how financial literacy intersects with everyday life\, especially for younger and often overwhelmed audiences\, Lavanya and Dipika bring both insight and clarity to a conversation that promises to be as useful as it is fun. \nExpect memes\, pop culture references\, stories from the book\, and zero jargon. Just real talk about money—how we use it\, why we fear it\, and how to make it work for us. \n

SUMMARY:Garam Roti
DESCRIPTION:Language: English\, Tamil & Hindi \nDurga and Lakshmi\, two artists – one a human\, the other a sentient stereo player set out for a performance of fears – to rant her truth and perform the dare. Durga asks herself what epitomizes ‘a woman’\, finally landing on the idea of a ‘Garam Roti’- the humble Indian flatbread.  \nWhat starts as a personal reflection on the matter\, culminates into an exercise of communal listening to rants (recordings) of women from across India. The play moves through borders of fiction into the non-fiction realm with the ‘Garam Roti Library’- an audio collection of women sharing their anecdotes\, thoughts on tradition\, labour and revolution. \nCredits:\nProduced by Playhouse Productions\nWriter\, Director\, Performer: Durga Venkatesan\nExecutive Producer: Sukrit Mahajan\nProduction: Meghna Manglani\, Nikhil Bansal & Varad Salvekar\nSound: Nikhil Bansal\nProjection: Sukrit Mahajan\nLights Design: Surya Saathi\nSound Design & Edit: Pause.Dxa\, Nikhil Bansal\nSound Dubbing: Rohan Kanwar\nVoice of Lakshmi: Durga Venkatesan\nSet & Publicity Design: Devika Saxena\nWelcome Kit Design: Rama Shivakumar\nArtistic Consultation: Mohammed Ellyas Lehry\nThe project was developed at Rangamadu in collaboration with Namkampani. \nThe Garam Roti Library has been developed with recordings of women from across India.

SUMMARY:Belonging and Unbelonging
DESCRIPTION:This conversation between writer and journalist Tsering Namgyal Khortsa and educator Ngawang Gyatso will explore themes of exile\, identity\, memory\, and belonging within the Tibetan diaspora. Focusing on the lived experience of Tibetans beyond the spiritual lens often associated with their narrative\, the session will examine how literature becomes a space for cultural preservation\, political reflection\, and personal inquiry. \nTsering Namgyal Khortsa is the author of Little Lhasa: Reflections on Exiled Tibet\, a collection of essays and interviews that chronicle the diverse voices and realities of the Tibetan exile community. From political activism and Buddhist practice to filmmaking and English-language literature\, the book presents a vivid portrait of life in Dharamsala\, seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile\, and the evolving identity of a people navigating displacement. \nHis novel Tibetan Suitcase follows Dawa Tashi\, an India-born Tibetan\, as he journeys across continents and inner worlds\, exploring questions of love\, cultural inheritance\, and spiritual searching. Told through letters and journal entries\, the novel captures the poignancy of existing between worlds\, without a homeland\, but anchored by memory and longing. \nTogether\, the conversation offers a window into Tibetan life as it is lived today—in exile\, in continuity\, and in search of home. A Q&A with the audience ll follow. \n

SUMMARY:Wolves of the Deccan
DESCRIPTION:Older than the Himalayas\, the Deccan is the oldest geological formation of the Indian subcontinent. Endemic species\, some found nowhere else on earth\, once inhabited this landscape\, teeming with wildlife. Gently undulating plains of endless grasslands and savannah\, rocky thorn and scrub jungles\, and riverine and riparian ecosystems\, were rich with an amazing biodiversity of flora and fauna. Tigers roamed and Asiatic Cheetah hunted Black Buck in high-speed chases across the plains. From Dung Beetles to Sloth Bears\, from the Great Indian Bustard to Caracals\, from millions of migratory birds arriving in winter\, to wild flora rich with life-giving sustenance\, this was the Deccan. From the unbearable heat of summer\, to the welcome monsoons\, the land was vibrant. From cool winters to a short spring\, culture and nature tell stories of millions of years of evolution.  \nFast forward to today\, and the reality of the effects of unsustainable development. Loss of habitat\, rampant illegal wildlife trade\, roadkill\, conflict with the grassroots level stakeholders\, have all taken a heavy toll. We have lost most of our pristine wilderness and over half of our flora and fauna. \nThis presentation will take the audience through a view of the past\, present and future of the Deccan landscape. It will include the work of the Deccan Conservation Foundation as para ecologists\, preserving\, protecting and conserving the last remaining isolated\, unprotected habitats and wilderness\, with a focus on the Indian Wolf\, the apex predator\, and other associated species. \nImage Credit: All photos by Indrajeet Ghorpade. \nPresented by the Deccan Conservation Foundation. \n \n

SUMMARY:Prabodhan - An Awakening
DESCRIPTION:Prabodhan – an awakening is an intimate offering of dance compositions that reflect and reveal the artist’s inner world. Each piece in this journey is a doorway to deeper presence and transformation—an awakening of the senses\, the spirit\, and the social conscience. \nThe performance opens with Madurapuri Chokkar Kauvuthuvam\, a celebration of Śiva’s splendor. In Rāvaṇa – the dot that moved\, the lens turns to Rāvaṇa—not as a demon\, but as a devotee whose fierce love evokes Śiva’s grace\, uncovering a powerful and unexpected reciprocity. \nIn Ganga\, ecological and personal histories entwine. It becomes a meditation on legacy—on what we inherit and what we pass on. This is an awakening to responsibility and the urgent need for care. \nThe final piece\, Chakra Alarippu\, brings the journey to alignment. It is a dance of balance—between breath and movement\, the self and the cosmos. \nThis is not performance as display\, but a quiet turning toward presence—a call to awaken. \nSupported by: \n \n
