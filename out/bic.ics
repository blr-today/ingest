SUMMARY:Frugal Innovation - India’s Edge
DESCRIPTION:India stands at a critical juncture\, balancing remarkable economic progress with persistent challenges. As the world’s fifth-largest economy\, India boasts impressive growth rates and has lifted millions out of poverty. However\, it still grapples with low per capita income\, inadequate human development\, and a large informal sector. \nThe nation faces resource constraints\, including energy dependence\, land scarcity\, and skilled labour shortages. These limitations pose significant hurdles to improving living standards for over half a billion people while maintaining ecological balance. \nThe key to India’s future lies in “frugal innovation” or “jugaad innovation” – doing more and better with less\, at scale. For decades\, Indian businesses and consumers have excelled in transforming limited resources into affordable solutions across various sectors. However\, much of this innovation has relied on adapting Western technology rather than developing original solutions. \nThis event explores how India can leverage its innate frugal ingenuity to create sustainable\, scalable solutions that address its unique challenges. We will discuss strategies for fostering indigenous technological innovation\, promoting inclusive growth\, and balancing development with environmental preservation. Join us to envision India’s path towards becoming a global leader in frugal innovation and sustainable development. \nA talk by author Jaideep Prabhu will be followed by a conversation with Mekin Maheshwari\, Founder & CEO\, Udhyam Learning Foundation and a Q&A session with the audience. \n  \n

SUMMARY:Universal Food Security
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a world without hunger and malnutrition. What would it take to achieve a genuinely food-secure world—where every person gets to consume the right quantity and quality of food to live a healthy\, active\, and productive life? \nAchieving and sustaining such a future requires transforming how our food is grown\, managed\, distributed\, and consumed. From production to consumption\, our food systems must be more sustainable\, halting environmental degradation\, and even repairing the damage we have previously done. \nGlenn Denning’s Universal Food Security: How to End Hunger While Protecting the Planet presents a bold\, evidence-based\, practical guide to food systems transformation. He bridges the divisive worlds of science\, policy\, and practice. By synthesizing the most relevant literature\, consulting the world’s foremost experts\, and sharing personal insights gained over four decades\, Denning lays out five priority areas for action and investment. \nBut in Universal Food Security\, Denning goes beyond what needs to change. He goes on to tackle the challenges of implementation. Echoing the words of his mentor\, the late Professor MS Swaminathan\, Denning argues that we need the knowhow and the do-how to transform our food systems.  \nUniversal Food Security calls for a new generation of enlightened practitioner-leaders—acting on their own and with others\, through institutions—to achieve a food-secure world. \nImage Captions:\nThumbnail\, Poster and Header: Rice crops in Cambodia\nInstastory: Maize crops in Malawi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Solving Avian Mysteries
DESCRIPTION:To find a rare bird is the ultimate dream of ornithologists and birdwatchers. But doing it requires a combination of skills including an understanding of habitats\, animal behaviour and people skills as well as plain old good luck.

SUMMARY:Putting the Story Back into History
DESCRIPTION:A little over five hundred years ago\, in a green valley surrounded by tall mountains\, a Timurid prince named Babur was born. Babur’s tumultuous life led him to India\, where he laid the foundations of what would become one of the wealthiest empires in the world. \nBabur’s descendants would reshape the cuisine\, music\, art and landscape of their new home\, creating a vibrant\, syncretic culture of intellectual curiosity and an openness to new influences. Yet\, from its zenith in the seventeenth century\, the empire would decline swiftly\, and end in tragedy three hundred years after it began. \nWho were the men and women who peopled this empire? How did their choices influence the course of history? From Humayun\, the emperor who looked to the stars for guidance\, to Jahangir\, the ever-curious traveller\, to the tragic figure of Shah Alam II\, this session will focus on the triumphs and tragedies of the Timurids\, and why their stories still matter. \nA talk by the author will be followed by a discussion with Meera Iyer\, INTACH and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:Sevens
DESCRIPTION:Sevens is a triple bill of dance pieces\, featuring Nina Rajarani as a performer\, as well as\nfour Bharatanatyam and Kathak dancers and three musicians in ensemble work. Seven\nSnags\, Seven Steps and Seven Sins explore the sacred and sinful significance of the\nnumber seven. \nSeven Snags \nThe choreographic equivalent of an obstacle race\, this is a fast-paced rhythmic ensemble filled with exciting dynamics and laced with challenging cross-rhythms. This is an abstract display of the fun and frolics of youth\, the flirtatious quality of interactions\, the freedom and liberties one takes with choices\, all inspired by the modern-day phenomena of speed dating and dating apps. \n  \nSeven Steps \nThis is a duet by dancer/choreographer Nina Rajarani MBE and vocalist/composer Y Yadavan\, based on ‘saptapadi’\, the most important rite of a Hindu marriage ceremony\, where with each step\, the couple make a promise to each other.  \nAlthough an age-old ritual dating back to Vedic times\, the vows remain relevant for anyone entering a committed relationship.  \nSeven Sins \nThis piece is an abstract exploration of stereotyped concept of rights and wrongs \, what it is like to live under the burden of the idea of sin. The behaviour we call ‘sinful’ is never simply that. Sins are the most profound expression of unmet needs. Representing an unfortunate response to difficulty and distress\, Seven Sins considers that we are not evil at all\, but in fact in all types of very human and difficult pain. \nThe piece evolves to evoke both the claustrophobic feeling of guilt that comes from living a life deemed sinful\, untrue or unacceptable; and the dark places we are driven towards by a capitalistic consumerist society that simultaneously demands and condemns accumulation and wealth. \nBut the journey of the piece is one of acceptance as we learn to listen\, not admonish or punish\, a way to forgiveness.  \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Pulse of the People: State of India-China Relations
DESCRIPTION:The past five years have witnessed a tremendous churn in India-China relations. Since the beginning of the standoff in Eastern Ladakh and the deadly clashes in the Galwan Valley\, the relationship has been rightly described as abnormal. Political dialogue has been limited and difficult. Economic ties have become highly securitised\, although trade has continued to grow. And civil society engagement has been severely curtailed. \nHowever\, with the recent completion of disengagement between the two militaries in Eastern Ladakh\, a fresh attempt now appears to be underway to normalise India-China ties. It remains to be seen if such a process can address the structural\, underlying issues that impact the bilateral relationship. \nIn such a scenario\, it is important to understand how the Indian public views China\, and the trajectory of India’s China policy going forward. What are their priorities? How do they expect the Indian government to react to key events that may emerge in the near future? The Takshashila Institution’s 2024 Survey report\, ‘Pulse of the People: State of India-China Relations’\, attempts to address these pertinent questions. \nThis session will launch the Survey report\, which shall be followed by a panel discussion on ‘A New Modus Vivendi with China’ – the future trajectory of India’s China policy. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:From Dust to Dust
DESCRIPTION:Situated on the hot and dry north Indian plains\, the city of Delhi has always lived with dust. But in the last three decades\, dust has transformed into a problem: air pollution. \nIn the world’s most polluted capital city\, debates about dust rise and subside like seasonal storms\, never quite becoming a public priority. Why? \nDespite its severe impacts on health\, why does air pollution become yet another element in a deteriorating urban environment to be borne and lived with\, rather than a public emergency that calls for urgent and drastic action? \nThis talk will address these questions by situating them within the cultural politics of environment and development. \nThis session is part of the Let’s Talk Climate Change Talk series. \nPresented by:\n \n

SUMMARY:From Africa to India
DESCRIPTION:74 mins | English with some English Subtitles | 2003 \nThe African-Indian Sidis of Gujarat practice a unique strand of Sufism. Followers of the 14th century Rifa’i Sufi Saint\, Bava Gor\, and his disciples Bava Habash and Mai Mishra\, Gujarati Sidis invoke Sidi Goma and Sidi Dhamal music and dance as fundamental ritual healing and social practices. Sidis of Karnataka follow various Christian\, Hindu\, and Muslim paths with their own music and dance traditions.  \nIn From Africa to India: Sidi Music in the Indian Ocean Diaspora\, and its sequel The Sidi Malunga Project: Rejuvenating the African Musical Bow in India\, UCLA ethnomusicologists Amy Catlin-Jairazbhoy and Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy trace the role of music in Sidi identity in Gujarat\, Karnataka\, Mumbai\, and Hyderabad.  \nProfessor Catlin-Jairazbhoy has been working with the Sidi community in Gujarat for more than 25 years. In 2002 she organized the “Sidis at the Millennium” conference where 400 Gujarati Sidis and several international scholars gathered at the Rajpipla Palace in Narmada District. Juje Siddi from Karnataka\, who plans to attend this screening with other local Siddis\, was a participant in the conference.   \nThe research was conducted with Amy’s Senior Fellowship from the American Institute of Indian Studies\, and is archived in their Archives and Research Centre for Ethnomusicology (ARCE) in Gurgaon\, Haryana. At the request of the Sidi community\, she co-directed the Sidi Literacy Project (2015-2024)\, and currently co-directs the Sidi Cultural Centre Project in Bharuch District (2024-) again with Sonal Mehta of Eklavya (Ahmedabad) and Professor Beheroze Shroff (University of California at Irvine).  She looks forward to introducing this project after the screening during discussion with the audience. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a conversation with the filmmaker. \n

SUMMARY:And\, Towards Happy Alleys
DESCRIPTION:75 mins | Persian\, English | 2023 | India\, Iran \nFascinated by Iran’s film culture and the poetic works of the feminist poet Forough Farrokhzad\, Indian filmmaker Sreemoyee Singh sets out in search of the protagonists of Iranian cinema. Her interactions over six years with filmmakers Jafar Panahi\, Mohammad Shirvani and human rights activist Nasrin Sotudeh\, among others\, depict the precarious situation in which critics of the regime find themselves\, including the constant threat of imprisonment and being banned from practicing their profession. With a keen eye for unusual situations\, she poetically captures the effect of the Islamic Republic’s omnipresent censorship on the daily lives of Iranian women whose uncompromising struggle has put them at the forefront of the protests that are currently rocking the country. \nAnd\, Towards Happy Alleys is a passionate declaration of love for the cinema and poetry of Iran which also provides a frank view of daily life\, and bears witness to a fearless generation raising its voice and implacably demanding its civil liberties. \nInspired by Iranian cinema and the poetry of Forough Farrokhzad\, a young director from India journeys to Tehran to witness how resistance becomes a daily act of survival in Iranian society. Despite stringent censorship of the Islamic Regime\, she collects a series of eloquent and candid interviews with filmmaker Jafar Panahi\, activists and Iranian women. Over six years\, these conversations with the camera capture the simmering anxieties\, fears\, hopes and dreams of a nation on the brink of revolution. \nThe screening will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n
