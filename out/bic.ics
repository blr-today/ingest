The politics of the time\, the many characters who strode the stage of History. They speak to us through their original letters which will take the reader to the very core of the story and give a ring side view of the events over a nearly three year period… \nA talk by Uday S Kulkarni will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Past\, Present and Possibilities
DESCRIPTION:4:00 pm – 5:20 pm : Lyd \n5:20 pm – 6:00 pm : Discussion \n6:15 pm – 6:30 pm : Break \n6:30 pm- 8:00 pm  : Bye Bye Tiberias \n8:00 pm- 9:00 pm  : Discussion \nLYD \nSpeculative Documentary | Arabic\, Hebrew with English subtitles | Palestine\, United Kingdom\, USA| Sarah Ema Friedland and Rami Younis |2023 \nLyd follows the rise and fall of Lyd\, a 5\,000-year-old metropolis that was once a bustling Palestinian town until it was conquered when the State of Israel was established in 1948. As the film unfolds\, a chorus of characters creates a tapestry of the Palestinian experience of this city and the trauma left by the massacre and expulsion\, while vivid animations envision an alternate reality where the same characters live free from the trauma of the past and the violence of the present. Using never-before-seen archival footage of the Israeli soldiers who carried out the massacre and expulsion\, the personified city explains that these events were so devastating that they fractured reality\, and now there are two Lyds – one occupied and one free. As the film cuts between fantastical and documentary realities\, it ultimately leaves the viewer questioning which future should prevail. Lyd dares to ask the question: what would the city be like had the Israeli occupation of Lyd never happened? \nLink to the trailer \nBye Bye Tiberias \nDocumentary Feature | French\, Palestinian Arabic with English subtitles | France\, Palestine\, Belgium\, Qatar | Lina Soualem | 2023 \nIn her early twenties\, Hiam Abbass (Emmy-nominated for Succession) left her native Palestinian village to follow her dream of becoming an actress in Europe\, leaving behind her mother\, grandmother\, and seven sisters. Thirty years later\, her filmmaker daughter Lina returns with her to the village and questions for the first time her mother’s bold choices\, her chosen exile and the way the women in their family influenced both their lives. Set between past and present\, BYE BYE TIBERIAS pieces together images of today\, family footage from the nineties and historical archives to portray four generations of daring Palestinian women who keep their story and legacy alive through the strength of their bonds\, despite exile\, dispossession\, and heartbreak. Palestine’s entry for Best International Feature in the 2024 Academy Awards\, this second feature from Lina Soualem premiered at Venice\, won the Grierson Award at the BFI London Film Festival\, had its North American Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival\, and won the shared jury prize at the Marrakech International Film Festival. An important film that beautifully portrays the complexity of Arab women’s lives. \nLink to the trailer \nIn collaboration with \n \n

SUMMARY:Karri-Djarrk-Durrkmirri (We-Together-Work)
DESCRIPTION:Timings: 11 am to 8 pm\nExhibition on show until Sunday\, 13 October \nWalkthroughs with the Artists:\nFriday\, 4 October\, 11:30 am\nSaturday\, 5 October\, 11:30 am \nBábbarra Women’s Centre\, in collaboration with Tharangini Studio\, presents a collection of woodblock textiles\, supported by the Australian Government’s Centre for Australia-India Relations. “Karri-djarrk-durrkmirri\,” meaning “we work together” in the Kuninjku language of West Arnhem Land\, embodies the collaborative spirit of this exhibition\, which blends heritage Indian textile traditions with culturally significant designs by Indigenous Australian women. \nBased in remote Maningrida\, 500 km east of Darwin\, Bábbarra Women’s Centre is dedicated to producing unique screen printed and Lino printed textiles that tell the stories of West Arnhem Land—its people\, traditional foods and spiritual beings like yawkyawk (mermaids). Since its inception in 1987 as a women’s refuge\, the Centre has supported women’s economic and social development. \nTharangini Studio\, a women-owned woodblock printing studio\, shares a commitment to craftsmanship and sustainability. Curators Prithi Pais and Anshu Arora have worked closely with director\, Padmini Govind to interpret the complex design briefs of the Babbarra women and add their expertise in ethically sourced fabrics\, natural dye and repeat patterns. \nKarri-djarrk-durrkmirri is an example of the beautiful artwork that can be created when Australia and India work together. Twenty-one unique textiles made from 77 individual woodblocks will be displayed. The woodblock designs were created by Bábbarra Women’s Centre artists over 20 years and reinterpreted into woodblocks by Tharangini Studio artisans. The fabric was produced under curatorial direction of Prithi Pais and Anshu Arora and Jessica Stalenberg in liaison with Bábbarra Women’s Centre. The exhibition also features embroidery by Porgai women artisans and two video works by Indian-Australian video artist and filmmaker Naina Sen with photographer Anahita Ananth. \nArtists: Deborah Wurrkidj\, Jennifer Wurrkidj (dec)\, Janet Marawarr\, Raylene Bonson\, Susan Marawarr\, Joy Garlbin\, Helen Lanyinwanga (dec)\, Lucy Yarawanga\, Nancy Gununwanga (dec)\, Carol Liyawanga\,  Abigial Gurawiliwili Namundja\, Ruth Bindiedbal\, Susan Marawarr\, Jay Jurrupula Rostron\, Elizabeth Wullunmingu\, Verity Bangarra and dilly bags by Maningrida Arts \nThe exhibition is open to all\, at the BIC Gallery\, from 4th October to 13th October 2024. Artist talks with visiting artists from Australia will be held on Friday\, 4th October and Saturday\, 5th October at 11:30am. \nThis marks Bábbarra’s second exhibition at BIC\, following their successful Jarracharra (Dry Season Winds) tour across India in March 2023\, supported by the Kolkata Consul-General. \nPresented by: \n \nImage credit: Artist Jennifer Wurrkidj (dec) and Janet Marawarr.

SUMMARY:The Secret Life of Monuments
DESCRIPTION:God on the Hill and Other Stories\, is a collection of ten stories mostly set around ancient monuments and their settings. Inspired by locales\, monuments and myths associated with them\, encountered by the author during nearly two decades of fieldwork studying the ancient architecture of India\, these stories focus attention on less-known aspects of these monuments. The themes around which these ten stories are crafted are varied – in a remote village in the Deccan\, impoverished villagers resort to human sacrifice to coax treasures out of prehistoric dolmens; over the ages\, an ancient menhir commemorating a dead hero is transformed into the deity in an imposing temple; the caretaker of a medieval tank makes the ultimate sacrifice to safeguard its bund from breaching; a one-armed sculptor carves a masterpiece in a Himalayan village in one night; a modern-day researcher comes face-to-face with characters from the distant past\, during a field trip; and the sculptor of an ancient stupa revisits it almost two-thousand years later. \nThis illustrated talk will bring alive the remarkable monuments and locales which inspired some of the stories in the book – such as megaliths in Kerala and Karnataka\, an Early Historic Buddhist Stupa\, and an exquisite little rock-cut temple in the Kumaon Himalaya. \nAfter the talk\, Srikumar Menon will be in conversation with Vinay Parameswarappa. A Q&A session with the audience will follow the discussion. \n

SUMMARY:Rethinking Satyagraha
DESCRIPTION:The word satyagraha is associated with Mohandas K Gandhi and is not a word one would tend to bracket with architectural practice. However\, if one accepts that creating a humane architecture requires coming to terms with what it means to be human before one seeks to be an architect\, it is an ideal that offers a powerful foundation for this quest. \nThe word is usually equated with the political strategy of non-violent civil resistance that Gandhi championed to gain India’s freedom from British colonialism. It has a far deeper meaning\, and is a moral code for life that\, in turn\, informs politics and many other human endeavours. It is an ideal that finds significant resonances in the nature of human consciousness\, making it accessible given we all know our consciousness from first-hand experience. \nThe connection to architectural practice will be drawn by examining the act of design and how it must draw connections between the professional autonomy of the architect and the primordial core of everyday life. Some implications on the nature of architectural space and the structure of architectural practice will be delineated. \nA talk by Prem Chandavarkar will be followed by a discussion with Anne Feenstra and a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:An Unequal Citizen?
DESCRIPTION:In 2018\, Rahul Bhatia left his job as an investigative reporter to understand the necessity of the Aadhaar project. But over time\, as he explored its roots\, questions about citizenship and belonging began to grow louder in public life\, culminating in extreme violence in New Delhi. As this happened\, he discovered that India’s technological identity project was linked to a cultural identity project over a century old. These investigations culminated in The Identity Project\, a journey through the slow burn of Indian democracy\, and a record that connects the past and present to offer the first thorough account of how cultural imperatives are guiding the country’s direction. He describes the religious\, societal\, and technological changes that have brought India to a point at which a nationalist mindset that challenges democracy and human rights is spreading fast\, all in an effort to bind the multiethnic\, multilingual\, and multicultural country into a single identity. \nThrough a character-driven narrative informed by on the ground reporting\, he investigates the history of disinformation in India\, and looks at how justice works in the aftermath of riots. What emerges is a timely portrait of a country struggling to define its identity. \nEditor and journalist Prem Panicker will discuss the book with Rahul Bhatia. They will talk about the book’s journey\, the process of reporting\, and about finding the language to report on recent history. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:நடபாவாடை | Nadapaavaadai
DESCRIPTION:60 Minutes | Tamil | Suitable for all ages \nThe play “Nadapaavaadai” centers on a woman who is forced to conduct burial rites for her entire village after the passing of her family member\, who previously performed these duties.  \nDue to social inequality and prevailing customs\, women are rarely permitted to even enter the crematorium. The characters in the play question the lady’s access to the crematorium and her role in carrying out those rituals that are traditionally associated with men. \n The charismatic lady performs the rites by taking the center stage\, with only men allowed to visit the crematorium. She leads the burial rites in full face of the public – which many would be reluctant to undertake or would not be allowed to do.   \n“Nadapaavaadai” attempts to initiate an engaging dialogue about her role in diverse social and cultural contexts and its implications. This play has evolved out of a close observation\, followed by an extensive ethnographic fieldwork\, engaging discussions\, and participatory playmaking. \nDirector’s Note \nCredit List \nCast\nManik Subramanian\nArchana Selvaraj\nAbinaya Jothi\nDevi Devadoss\nTamilarasan \nMusicians\nSuren Sekaran\nSathya Sharath \nLight Design: Suthan \nStage Manager: Nethaji \nTechnical Assistant: Raagul \nDesign and Direction: Ramassamy S \nSupported By: The Perch Collective \nSpecial Thanks: Kumari Amma Rajiv Krishnan \nAbout the Velippadai Theatre Movement: \nVelippadai Theatre Movement was founded as a community initiative in 2013 to develop deep connection with the lives\, sufferings and concerns of the self and others as well\, and to inculcate a new awareness in the rural context of Pondicherry about both tradition and modernity.

SUMMARY:A People's History of the Mughal Empire
DESCRIPTION:Professor Satish Chandra was one of the first historians to shift our attention from the emperors of the Mughal Empire to its people. \nDrawing upon his works\, this lecture highlights the contribution of common people in the formation of the empire. It does this by focusing on two groups that played important roles in the domain of warfare. Firstly\, it investigates the vast numbers of mercenaries and armed peasants who served as foot-soldiers in the armies. They served as guards\, swordsmen\, gunners\, and archers. Secondly\, it studies the pioneers\, carpenters\, stone-cutters\, boatmen\, and other workers who toiled in the domain of military logistics. They built roads\, constructed bridges\, dug tunnels\, and looked after the war-animals in the course of campaigns. It argues that the participation of vast numbers of common people in these two capacities was key to the functioning of the empire. This implies that the empire was not an elite project created only by emperors\, noblemen\, and courtiers. Rather\, it was a broad-based political entity that rested on the work and involvement of vast sections of the South Asian population. \nAbout Prof. Satish Chandra \nProf. Satish Chandra (1922 – 2017) was a leading authority on Medieval Indian History. \nIn a career spanning nearly 40 years\, Prof. Chandra taught history at Allahabad University\, Aligarh Muslim University\, Delhi University\, Rajasthan University\, and finally the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)\, where along with S. Gopal\, Bipin Chandra and Romila Thapar he co-founded the Centre for Historical Studies. \nIn between\, from 1972 to 1980 he was first Vice Chairman and then the Chairman of the University Grants Commission. \nIn 1985\, along with intellectuals like Prof. Nurul Hasan and marine biologist Dr. Zahoor Qasim\, he founded the Society for Indian Ocean Studies which\, among other activities\, brings out the quarterly Journal for Indian Ocean Studies. \nSon of Sir Sita Ram\, India’s first High Commissioner to Pakistan (1947-48)\, Prof. Chandra has\, along with some other JNU historians\, been said to have been a ‘left leaning historian’ who espoused the Marxist approach to history\, and one whose early experiences helped bridge the intellectual gap in interpreting medieval Indian history and modern times. \n

SUMMARY:आनंदओवरी | Anandowari
DESCRIPTION:90 Minutes | Hindi (Tukaram abhangs will be sung in Marathi) | Ages 16 years + \nThis play is an adaptation of the seminal Marathi novel ‘Anandowari’ written by D.B. Mokashi in 1974. \nAnandowari (English translation: ‘The Verandah of Bliss’) looks at 17th-century saint poet Tukaram’s story through his younger brother Kanha’s perspective. Tukaram has gone missing again. This time\, though\, the hints seem ominous. We travel through those 3 days of Kanha’s frantic search for Tuka and his many realisations about his brother. \nIn reminiscing about Tukaram\, Kanha tries to grapple with Tuka’s many identities: Tuka his brother\, the son\, the householder\, the creative genius\, a saint\, a reformer\, a rebel. \nThis act of reminiscence becomes an act of grappling with what and who he has lost\, in the process giving us a great psychological insight into the events (personal\, social and political) and impulses that shaped Tukaram’s consciousness and made him who he was: one of the most beloved Bhakti saint poets of Maharashtra\, as tender as he was fierce\, as compassionate as he was unforgivingly harsh\, as much a reformist as he was a transcendentalist. \nOur adaptation focuses on the search that lies at the heart of the text: a devotee in search of God\, a man in search of his brother\, a writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nCredits: \nOriginal Novel Anandowari by D.B Mokashi\nAdaptation and Direction: Gerish Khemani\nHindi Translation: Dr Jaya Dayal\nPerformed by: Varad Salvekar\, Hrishabh Kanti\nBackground Score: Ruturaj Bhosle\nAbhang Composition: Keshav Kudale\nLight Design: Sachin Lele\nLights Operation: Prerana\nPoster and Creatives: Robin Patel \nDirector’s Note: \nWhat interested me personally was the question of the creative consciousness of the saint poet Tukaram\, the source of his poetry\, his metaphysical preoccupations\, his social rebellion\, his love for his beloved God Vitthal. I was interested in finding a device through which I could approach this text. And then it struck me: what would happen if the writer stepped into his own story? His character has found salvation\, what about the writer? How will he? It is an investigation into that search… A devotee in search of God. A man in search of his brother. A writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nThrough two texts – D. B Mokashi’s original Anandowari and my text where Tuka meets Vithal and Mokashi enters his own story – multiple confrontations are imagined. Confrontation between Mokashi (writer) and Kanha (character)\, confrontation between Tuka (devotee) and Vitthal (God). Creator and creation? One writer (Mokashi) searching for another (Tuka)? And then the question prevails: Who gives meaning to the other? Both depend on each other for meaning. For identity. Can there be a God without a devotee? Can there be a writer without her creation? Each validates the other. And each has the power to cancel each other out. \nBut then what if they exchange roles? Or what if this duality itself is the biggest illusion? And so these two texts came to be juxtaposed\, hoping to interpenetrate and illuminate each other. \nOur adaptation of Anandowari reeks of tremendous longing for the absolute and the madness\, pain of creative consciousness and its concomitant search for meaning embodied in the existential desperation of the protagonists. \nWith Support From \n \n  \n
