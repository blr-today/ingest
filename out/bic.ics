SUMMARY:Tara's Trio
DESCRIPTION:English | 85 Mins | For Ages 5 to 13 Years \nTara is nine years old and lives with her parents. Little does she know that there are three other companions Andro (Technology)\, Wadeva (Boredom) and Imagenie (Imagination) who also live with her. These three love Tara very much and are constantly competing with each other to get her attention. Her Dad loves his gadgets and her Mom tries to keep everyone’s imagination alive. \nIt’s summer break and they are off to visit Nani. The rest of the play is about the crazy adventure they end up having. Their car breaks down near a forest. A con man ‘Baba Black Sheep Singh’ appears and offers to help. He hypnotizes the parents and starts to loot the car. At first Tara is scared but as things get more complicated\, she realizes that she will have to do something. Turns out the three secret companions are more than happy to jump in. They help Tara to come up with an explosive plan to scare the baba and bring him to his knees. \nDirectors’ Note: \nEverything is fine in equal measure\,\nFinding a balance is finding treasure\,\nNothing is good or bad ifs all your perception\,\nBut watch out beware don’t be fooled by deception \nWith everything in moderation\,\nWe can be a happy nation\,\nTechnology\, Imagination\,\nAnd even Boredom. \nThe play explores the basic idea and importance of technology\, boredom imagination in daily life of a child. In big cities\, there is a lack of space for children to be physically activity\, most schools don’t even have a playground and parents are busy with their lives leaving them with no time for kids. This has led to children also being stuck in their rooms glued to plastic screens. Whatever happened to reading books\, playing those make-believe games or finding inventive ways to pass the time? Apart from reaffirming the need to be imaginative\, the play also tries to change our perception towards Boredom which is mostly seen as negative. \nCast & Crew \nAndro: Jeh Alexandar / Sukrit Mahajan\nWadeva: Kiyomi Mehta / Meghna Roy Chaudhary\nImagenie: Shreya Sharma / Twvinkle Kapoor\nTara: Shristi Sharma / Prarthana Kudtarkar\nMamma: Deepa Panchal\nPapa: Ameet Bhuvan / Danesh Gopalkrishnan\nBaba Black Sheep Singh: Kaustav Sinha\nGPS Voice: Dilnaz Irani\nBig G Voice: Maneesh Verma \nDirection: Kalyani Hiwale & Akhshay Gandhi\nScript\, Lyrics & Music: Asif Ali Beg\nStory: Kalyani Hiwale & Maneesh Verma\nMusic Producer: Kaizad Gherda\nCostumes: Sonal Kharade\nAssistant Director: Vishal\nLights: Vishal & Niranjan Jadhao\nSets & Props: Kapil Dev & Niranjan Jadhao\nStage Manager: Monika Gupta\nPublicity Design: Maneesh Verma\nExecutive Producer: Anita Gandhi\nAssociate Producer: Shimlli Basu\nCreative Producer: Maneesh Verma \nOur Muses: Aadya Verma & Neev Gandhi \nProduced by Collective Madness in collaboration with Conservatory for Arts & Artists\nSupported by Bhasha Centre and Insider under their co-producing initiative – Manch \n

SUMMARY:Chardi Kala
DESCRIPTION:95 mins | Punjabi\, Hindi with English Subtitles | India\nTrigger Warning: Sensitive Content\n \nDirection\, Camera and Editing – Prateek Shekhar\nMusic – Nipun Bhatnagar\nColorist – Divya Kehr\nDrone – Sashawhyy\nMixing Engineer – Abhishek Singh \nIn September 2020\, the Indian government passed three agricultural laws aimed at liberalising the farm economy. Soon after\, farmers from across the country gathered at the borders of India’s national capital\, New Delhi\, for one of the biggest non-violent protests in modern history.  \nExpressing their concerns about the dangers of corporatisation of agriculture\, farmers articulated detailed and nuanced criticism against what they believed were unjust laws. Over the year-long protest\, the farmers slept and cooked on the national highway\, braving extreme weather conditions and hostility from their government\, until the laws were repealed. \nAlong with the strong mobilisation by the farmer unions\, it was the embodiment of Sikh principle of sewa (selfless service for the betterment of society) and the expression chardi kala (eternal optimism) that made the movement dynamic\, unique and strengthened its undying and indomitable spirit. \nInspired by their everyday resilience\, Chardi Kala follows the journey of the farmers’ protest until their victory. The one-person-crew film observes\, listens and documents the farmers’ comprehensive arguments\, their acts of selfless service and the spirit of eternal optimism that imbued this grassroots-led movement as it made history.  \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:ಕೆರೆಗಳ ನಗರಿಯಿಂದ ಟ್ಯಾಂಕರ್ ನಗರದೆಡೆಗೆ | City of Lakes to City of Tankers
DESCRIPTION:In Bangalore\, the dynamic interplay between urban forests\, lakes\, and groundwater exemplifies both the challenges and opportunities of managing natural resources in a rapidly growing metropolis. \nUrban forests in Bangalore\, including iconic green spaces like Lalbagh and Cubbon Park\, serve as vital lungs for the city\, offering respite from the urban bustle and enhancing air quality. These wooded areas not only provide recreational opportunities but also support biodiversity conservation efforts\, hosting a rich array of flora and fauna amidst the urban sprawl. However\, the sustainability of Bangalore’s urban forests faces threats from encroachment\, pollution\, and inadequate management practices\, highlighting the need for concerted conservation efforts and community engagement to safeguard these green havens. \nSimilarly\, Bangalore’s numerous lakes\, once the pride of the city\, now grapple with pollution\, encroachment\, and diminishing water levels. From iconic water bodies like Ulsoor Lake to smaller neighborhood ponds\, these lakes play critical roles in replenishing groundwater\, supporting biodiversity\, and providing recreational spaces for residents. Efforts to rejuvenate Bangalore’s lakes\, such as the rejuvenation of Bellandur and Varthur Lakes\, underscore the importance of holistic approaches that address water quality\, ecological restoration\, and community participation. \nGroundwater\, a lifeline for Bangalore’s burgeoning population\, faces sustainability challenges due to rapid urbanization\, unchecked extraction\, and contamination. The city’s reliance on groundwater for drinking water\, industrial\, and agricultural needs underscores the urgency of adopting efficient water management practices\, promoting rainwater harvesting\, and curbing pollution to safeguard this precious resource. Initiatives like the “Recharge Bengaluru” campaign aim to replenish groundwater levels by restoring traditional water harvesting structures and enhancing infiltration of rainwater into the aquifer. \nThis panel will discuss the nexus of urban forests\, lakes\, and groundwater in Bangalore which underscores the complex relationship between urbanisation\, natural resource management\, and environmental sustainability. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nThis session will be in Kannada and English. \n

SUMMARY:Kaafi
DESCRIPTION:Urdu and Hindi | 60 mins | Suitable for all ages \nKaafi is a dance theatre production that explores the multifaceted nature of blindness\, both physical and metaphorical\, through the lens of the character Gandhari from the Indian epic\, Mahabharata. The performance uses the form of Bharathanatyam to delve into themes of ideals and examples\, conformity\, oppression\, the roles assigned to a woman\, and the consequences of our choices. Kaafi contextualises evocative political poetry to narrate the story in the nostalgic memory of Gandhari\, her absurd choices\, and examines the unseen forces that dictated it. The performance imagines and weaves an intimate tale of her reasons and feelings. A haunting voice that cursed her to perpetual darkness; shackled by the multiple roles of a daughter\, wife\, mother\, and queen\, that competed and tore her apart; her relationship with her only kin; her participation and perpetrating of the oppression and violence and an obscured vision of what her life could have been. \nKaafi becomes a mirror reflecting the universal struggle of every woman across time and space. It explores the perpetual tension between aspiration and reality that is predestined for every woman; aspiring to be ideal but perennially falling short—forever insufficient\, yet infinitely compelling. Through a combination of dance\, symbolism\, and internal monologues\, the performance invites the audience to reflect on how we navigate the intricacies of our existence\, condition of our life and the act of seeing\, constantly tugging at the personal question and political state of affairs. \nArtists and Collaborators  \nEnsemble – Adithi\, Karuna\, Smitha\, Keerthana\, Krutika\,\nChoreography- Priyanka Chandrasekhar\nLanguage – Urdu and Hindi\nStyle of dance – Bharathanatyam\nMusic production – Dheeraj Baneerjee\nAssistance in composition – Karuna Kirtivasan and Arvind Sridhar\nVocals and voice – Deepthi Baskar\nVocal and voice support – Karuna Kirtivasan and Talin Subbaraya\nLights – Arvind Sridhar\nText – Poetry by Faiz Ahmed Faiz\, Akhtar Sheerani\, Excerpts from Kartika Nair’s – Until the Lions\nCreatives\, photos and film – Arvind Sridhar \n

SUMMARY:Travelling without Travelling
DESCRIPTION:“The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.” – St Augustine \nIn this silent reading session\, we’ll journey through the captivating world of travel writing. From historical explorers like Marco Polo and Ibn Batutta to modern authors such as Dervla Murphy\, Pico Iyer and Michael Palin\, we’ll explore how the themes of travel have evolved over time.

SUMMARY:Decoding the Language of a Cinematic Polymath
DESCRIPTION:A new cinema movement emerged in India in the late 1960s with a proposition for artistic cinema not influenced by any considerations other than creative and aesthetic. The promise of this movement\, known variously as “Indian New Wave”\, “New Cinema” or “Parallel Cinema” was that conscientious filmmakers will make cinema which will bear the distinct stamp of the creative artist and not that of a studio. In form and aesthetics\, the new wave aimed to reject the forms and values of commercial cinema which relied on the stars\, the gaudy sets\, many irrelevant musical sequences and melodrama. This movement attracted many young artists who went on to become well-known auteurs. Indian new wave’s body of work\, spanning close to three decades\, charted a new course in cinema aesthetics with its zealous attempts to experiment with the language of cinema. At the same time\, the new wave auteurs’ steadfast political commitment resulted in a critical examination of the complexities of India’s socio-political realities. \nIt is important to point out that there was no formal process or a formally run operation for this movement. Although the initial impetus to the movement came from the loans provided by the Film Finance Corporation\, the passion to make artistic cinema\, fuelled by the newly trained filmmakers from the Film and Television Institute of India\, spread to different parts of the country. \nIn the Kannada language\, serendipitously\, the first artistic attempt to break free from reigning commercial filmmaking practices came in 1970 when Pattabhirama Reddy produced and directed Samskara – at approximately the same time when the Film Finance Corporation was funding what are considered as the first three films of the Indian new wave: Uski Roti\, Ankur and Sara Aakash. Samskara’s success was followed by a few other experiments by filmmakers such as Girish Karnad\, N Lakshminarayan and BV Karanth. \nBut the one auteur who went on to make some of the most influential and groundbreaking films and put Kannada cinema on the world map was Girish Kasaravalli. \nGirish Kasaravalli graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India in 1975\, and his first film as a Director was Ghatashraddha (1977). In the last 47 years since\, Girish’s body of work – 17 feature films and one television series – has critically engaged with the social\, political\, ideological\, philosophical and environmental concerns of the Kannada society and\, in a larger sense\, of India. Kasaravalli’s films have won him four Golden Lotuses (National Award for best feature film from the Government of India)\, a Padma Shri and many other awards and recognitions in film festivals across the world. \nToday\, when we have access to a variety of content at our fingertips\, it is essential to engage with the work of Girish Kasaravalli and learn his remarkable mastery of the formal\, aesthetic and thematic aspects of filmmaking and understand his contributions to film art.. \nIn this retrospective of Girish Kasaravalli\, we screen five of his films and also have conversations with him and other collaborators after each screening. \n\n\n\nEvent \nDate \nTime \n\n\nIntroduction and Context Setting\nSaturday\, May 4\n2:30 – 2:45 pm\n\n\nGhatashraddha (The Ritual) \n108 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 1977\nSaturday\, May 4\n2:45 – 4:45 pm\n\n\nGirish Kasaravalli in conversation with Basav Biradar\nSaturday\, May 4\n5:30 – 6:30 pm\n\n\nThaayi Saheba \n119 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 1997\nSaturday\, May 4\n7:00 – 9:00 pm\n\n\nIntroduction and Context Setting​\nSunday\, May 5\n10:30 – 11:00 am\n\n\nGulabi Talkies  \n118 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2008\nSunday\, May 5\n11:00- 1:00 pm\n\n\nKoormavatara \n115 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2011\nSunday\, May 5\n2:30 – 4:45 pm\n\n\nGirish Kasaravalli in conversation with Nikhila H\nSunday\, May 5\n5:30 – 6:30 pm\n\n\nKanasemba Kudareyeneri \n105 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2010\nSunday\, May 5\n6:45 – 9:00 pm\n\n\n\n  \nB-Cinematic \nCalling all cinephiles! BIC is thrilled to introduce B-Cinematic\, an initiative dedicated to celebrating the most essential\, impactful\, and artistically significant cinematic works from across the state and the country. \nAt B-Cinematic\, our mission is to curate and share those remarkable films that is a must-watch (or re-watch) experience for every passionate cinema lover. From groundbreaking classics to under-appreciated gems\, our carefully curated selection will take you on an unparalleled (pun not intended) cinematic journey through the ages. \nThrough curated screenings\, insightful discussions\, and engaging analyses from distinguished cinematic voices\, we aim to not only watch these films together but to truly appreciate their craftsmanship\, cultural impact\, and intellectual depth. Our vibrant community of film aficionados will collectively rediscover Indian cinema’s most stunning and enduring masterpieces. \nSo join us on this quest to experience the films that have defined and redefined the art form. Don’t miss out on crossing these essential works off your bucket list. Because to truly live\, you must first watch the films that make life worth living. \n

SUMMARY:Echoes of AI
DESCRIPTION:On the surface\, an Indian doctor\, a British poet\, an UberEats courier in Pittsburgh\, and a Chinese activist in exile have nothing in common. But they are in fact linked by a profound common experience―unexpected encounters with artificial intelligence. In her debut book Code Dependent\, shortlisted for the inaugural Women’s Prize for Non-fiction 2024\, Madhumita Murgia shows how automated systems are reshaping our lives all over the world\, from technology that marks children as future criminals\, to an app that is helping to offer medical diagnoses to a remote tribal community. \nBy highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley\, Madhumita explores the impact of this often-exploitative technology on individuals\, communities\, and our wider society. \nVidushi Marda\, a lawyer and researcher\, specialises in examining the socio-legal ramifications of data-driven technologies. Her research centers on technology regulation\, asymmetric power dynamics\, and fundamental rights. Through her endeavors\, she collaborates with governments\, corporations\, and technical communities to promote social justice. \nTogether\, they will discuss and unpack how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency\, and shatter our illusion of free will. AI has already infiltrated our day-to-day\, through language-generating chatbots like ChatGPT and social media. But it’s also affecting us in more insidious ways. It touches everything from our interpersonal relationships\, to our kids’ education\, work\, finances\, public services\, and even our human rights. It is already changing what it means to be human\, in ways large and small\, and Madhumita and Vidushi reveal what could happen if we fail to reclaim our humanity. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Asamana Anasuya
DESCRIPTION:92 Minutes 36 Seconds | English & Telugu with English Subtitles | 2023 \nAsamana Anasuya (Incomparable Anasuya)\, is a documentary directed by Seetha Ratnakar as a tribute to her mother Vinjamuri Anasuya Devi.  \nVinjamuri Anasuya Devi was a musical prodigy who started giving concerts at the age of 7. Her first gramophone recording\, Ayyo Koyyoda at age 8\, ignited her lifelong love affair with folk music. She was a trailblazer who introduced folk songs on a concert platform when she was 11. Encouraged by the overwhelming response she started giving full length folk concerts along with her sister\, Vinjamuri Seetha Devi. Popularly known as the Vinjamuri Sisters\, they became a phenomenon that took the music world by storm.  \nAnasuya started composing music for her uncle\, Devulapalli Krishna Sastri when she was 9 and became a sought-after music composer. She was multi-talented and excelled in music of every genre but folk music remained her passion. She dedicated her life to popularising and propagating traditional and folk songs. She bequeathed an invaluable legacy to posterity by categorising her vast collection into 7 volumes and publishing them along with lyrics and music notations. At the age of 80\, Anasuya became a writer and published 4 books including her autobiography Asamana Anasuya\, at the age of 94.  \nThe film screening will be followed by a Q&A with the director. \n

SUMMARY:Main Tawaif
DESCRIPTION:Main Tawaif is a presentation by Manjari Chaturvedi\, under The Courtesan Project Series. 15 years in existence\, the series is founded and conceptualised by Classical Dancer\, Creator of Sufi Kathak\, and Restorer of the Dance of Tawaifs\, Manjari Chaturvedi. The Courtesan Project has become one of the most successful dance revival movements in today’s time. Giving a voice to the women and 100s of years of creative contribution to theatre\, cinema and performing arts. \nThis performance is an exploration of the gender dynamics within the arts\, unveiling the pivotal influence of women performers – the enigmatic Tawaifs and Baijis – of North India from the 16th to the 20th century. The performance is set as an intimate mehfil performance of how the Tawaifs would perform in yesteryears. Their music\, their stories\, their dance enacted by a single performer. \nThis is a bold statement that is needed to finally accord respect for the performance art of the Tawaif\, to go beyond the drawing room sniggers and laughter associated with the word Tawaif\, and to finally acknowledge their role in history. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Accelerating Expanding Universe
DESCRIPTION:Dark energy is the leading candidate for the mechanism that is responsible for causing the cosmological expansion to accelerate. Bharat Ratra will describe the astronomical data which persuade cosmologists that (as yet undetected) dark energy and dark matter are by far the main components of the energy budget of the universe at the present time. He will review how these observations have led to the development of a quantitative “standard” model of cosmology that describes the evolution of the universe from an early epoch of inflation to the complex hierarchy of structure seen today. In this non-technical talk\, he will also discuss the basic physics\, and the history of ideas\, on which this model is based. \nIn collaboration with Raman Research Institute\, Bangalore. \n \n

SUMMARY:Caste in Modern India
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: Friday\, 31 May\nTimings: 11:00 am – 8:00 pm\nExhibition on show until Sunday\, 2 June \nWalkthroughs:\nFriday\, 31 May | 6:00 pm\nSaturday\, 1 June | 11:30 am & 5:30 pm\nSunday\, 2 June | 10:45 am \nConversations:\nInaugural Address – Friday\, 31 May | 6:45 pm\nPanel Discussion – Sunday\, 2 June | 11:30 am \nRailways and postal services were introduced in colonial India in the early 1850s. In due course\, these new technologies made long-distance travel and communication widely accessible and affordable. In a parallel development\, the introduction of limited representation in legislatures in the 1890s added urgency to tap the potential trans-local identities enumerated in the decennial censuses beginning in 1871-72. \nIn view of these developments\, local communities\, in particular\, castes\, tapped new technologies to connect with kindred groups across the country and combine to form pan-Indian communities. Post offices allowed members of these aggregate groupings to correspond with each other\, while railways enabled them to meet periodically and devise strategies to capture a share in legislatures\, educational institutions and public employment proportionate to their census population. Drawing upon philatelic material covering a century\, the exhibition highlights the role of the postal system in this new politics. \nThe exhibition is divided into two broad parts that bring together correspondence and publications of several caste-based community organisations and individuals from across the country and the philatelic output of the post-colonial state. \nProf Gopal Guru will inaugurate the exhibition and deliver the inaugural address on May 31\, 6:45 pm. He will offer his comments on the exhibition and locate the images in the larger politics of visual culture. \nA Panel Discussion with Prof. Satish Deshapnde\, a distinguished social scientist who has made seminal contributions to our understanding of caste in independent India\, Vaishna Roy\, Editor-in-Chief\, Frontline magazine and Vikas Kumar\, Curator of the exhibit\, will take place on 2 June\, 11:30 am. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Rise and Fall of the Vanderbilts
DESCRIPTION:Once upon a time\, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations\, the wealth-worth billions in today’s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change – the emotional and the rational – and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business\, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture\, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change—something prevalent in today’s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away. The authors will share their insight on how it’s imperative to draw lessons from the past\, navigate the present\, and prepare for the future. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n
