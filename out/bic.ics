SUMMARY:Abhipsaa — A Seeking
DESCRIPTION:Abhipsaa — A Seeking charts a journey of discovery in physical\, emotional\, and spiritual realms. \nIn four choreographic works\, Bihayini Satpathy expands the parameters of the formal and representational norms of the Odissi tradition through both narrative and non-narrative dances – reimagining classical Odissi forms through a personalised interpretation. \nCommissioned by Duke University and the Baryshnikov Arts Center\, Abhipsaa — A Seeking\, takes the audience on a profoundly personal journey. In collaboration with musicians\, composers\, lighting and theatrical designers\, Satpathy’s performance is an otherworldly and transformative experience. A selection of the piece was presented virtually by the Baryshnikov Arts Center with introduction by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Mark Morris in February 2021 and the full piece had its world premiere performances at Duke University in December 2021. \nThis work was made possible with additional funding from the New England Foundation for the Arts’ National Dance Project\, with lead funding from the Doris Duke Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. \n

SUMMARY:Kattam Katti
DESCRIPTION:Kattam Katti transports you to Uttarayan\, the world-famous kite festival in Gujurat\, North India\, where millions of people from different cities\, religions\, and social classes come together to fly kites\, marking the transition from winter into spring.  \nTapping into the competitive chaos\, creativity\, and colour of the event\, the show brings to life the excitement of Uttarayan with lyricism\, drama\, and exquisite technique.

SUMMARY:Dante Beyond Borders
DESCRIPTION:Dante Beyond Borders is an Italian Indian co-production born from the collaboration between Instabili Vaganti and Ahum Trust and inspired by the Divine Comedy of the great Italian Poet Dante Alighieri\, on the occasion of his 700 years death’s anniversary. \nThe performance explores different artistic languages: experimental theatre\, dance\, cinema\, video art and electronic music in order to bring the spectator into the otherworldly journey made by Dante. The sounds of Dante’s ancient Italian language meet the mudras and gestures of  the traditional Bharatanatyam dance\, accompanied by the contemporary electronic soundscapes originally composed by the Oscar winning Italian musician Riccardo Nanni\, around the leading suggestion of the Absence\, an element that permeates Dante’s works. \nThe evocative physical actions of the performer Nicola Pianzola and the dance of Anuradha Venkataraman interact with the videos realised by the artists of the project through a remote collaboration developed during the lockdown. \nThe performance aims to explore the  numerous connections between Dante’s work and Indian culture\, both from an iconographic\, philosophical and theological point of view. \nDirection: Anna Dora Dorno\nDramaturgy: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\nPerformers: Nicola Pianzola\, Anuradha Venkataraman\nChoreography: Anuradha Venkataraman\, Nicola Pianzola\nPerformance in video\, original songs and voice over: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\, Anuradha Venkataraman\nOriginal music and sound design: Riccardo Nanni\nVideo creation: Anna Dora Dorno\, Nicola Pianzola\, Ashwin Iyer\nSet and Light design: Anna Dora Dorno\nProduction: Istituto Italiano di cultura in Mumbai\, Instabili Vaganti\, Ahum Trust\nSupporters: MIC Ministry of culture / Istituto Italiano di cultura in New Delhi \nIn collaboration with: \n      \n

SUMMARY:Universal Food Security
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a world without hunger and malnutrition. What would it take to achieve a genuinely food-secure world—where every person gets to consume the right quantity and quality of food to live a healthy\, active\, and productive life? \nAchieving and sustaining such a future requires transforming how our food is grown\, managed\, distributed\, and consumed. From production to consumption\, our food systems must be more sustainable\, halting environmental degradation\, and even repairing the damage we have previously done. \nGlenn Denning’s Universal Food Security: How to End Hunger While Protecting the Planet presents a bold\, evidence-based\, practical guide to food systems transformation. He bridges the divisive worlds of science\, policy\, and practice. By synthesizing the most relevant literature\, consulting the world’s foremost experts\, and sharing personal insights gained over four decades\, Denning lays out five priority areas for action and investment. \nBut in Universal Food Security\, Denning goes beyond what needs to change. He goes on to tackle the challenges of implementation. Echoing the words of his mentor\, the late Professor MS Swaminathan\, Denning argues that we need the knowhow and the do-how to transform our food systems.  \nUniversal Food Security calls for a new generation of enlightened practitioner-leaders—acting on their own and with others\, through institutions—to achieve a food-secure world. \nImage Captions:\nThumbnail\, Poster and Header: Rice crops in Cambodia\nInstastory: Maize crops in Malawi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:That’s All Folks!
DESCRIPTION:*This work contains scenes that explore mature themes. Viewer discretion is advised.* \nThe irreverent That’s All Folks!\, premiered at the Equilibrio Festival 2024 and draws inspiration from cartoons. In a minimalist set\, a quartet of international performers—Damiano Ottavio Bigi\, Ching-Ying Chien\, Issue Park\, and Faith Prendergast—explore a work that blends dance\, science\, and myth. Inspired by the concept of the ‘event horizon\,’ it delves into physical vertigo\, the fall\, and being drawn into a space where perspective shifts and everything changes depending on where we look. \nThis project continues the themes of Un Discreto Protagonista\, expanding the conversation on choreographic writing and artistic composition. While the previous work focused on the universe’s origins and astronomical processes\, this piece shifts to humanity’s relationship with the cosmos. \nWorking with a quartet of dancers\, the team explored two distinct paths. The first centers on a “purely physical narrative\,” using complex movement patterns to create a thematic structure that unfolds gradually. This investigation draws on ritual forms connected to founding myths and cosmology\, balancing irrationality with control and chaos with logic to explore interconnected spatial and dimensional relationships. \nThe second path constructs four characters suspended in an undefined space—a non-time and non-place—where they encounter their unconscious and archetypal memories. Inspired by the event horizon concept\, the characters search for a new beginning\, questioning whether our world could have emerged from a previous universe\, in a moment called “the bounce\,” when space and time dissolved into a cloud of probabilities. \nThrough this journey\, they question the nature of time\, motion\, and instability in a place where there is no fixed perspective. Our vulnerabilities and strengths are mixed as we teeter on the edge\, learning more about ourselves. \nCreated by Damiano Ottavio Bigi & Alessandra Paoletti\nPerformers: Damiano Ottavio Bigi\, Ching-Ying Chien\, Issue Park\, Faith Prendergast\nComposition and Sound Design: David Blouin\nMusic: David Blouin\, Colin Stetson / Sarah Neufeld Duo\, Gary ‘Oslide\, Henry Purcell\, Hank Williams\nLighting Design: Lucien Laborderie\nSet and Costumes: In collaboration with Tzela Christopoulou\nSet Construction: Marios Karaolis \nIn collaboration with: \n        \n

SUMMARY:The Rite of Strings
DESCRIPTION:This unique Indian Classical performance featuring a double neck guitar\, tabla and kanjeera\, bridges tradition and innovation creating a spellbinding tapestry of rhythm and melody. \nThe double-neck guitar\, blending the versatility of modern string instruments with the evocative tones of Indian ragas\, takes center stage. Its rich\, resonant sound captures the nuances of classical compositions. Complementing this melodic brilliance is the tabla\, whose intricate rhythms breathe life into every beat. With its dynamic range and precision\, the tabla sets a pulsating foundation that elevates the musical experience. Adding a distinctive flavor to this trio is the kanjira\, a small but powerful frame drum renowned for its versatility. Its sharp\, expressive tones seamlessly blend with the other instruments\, enriching the rhythmic dialogue with bursts of spontaneity and virtuosity. \nTogether\, Anupam\, Amit and Swami embark on a journey through soulful ragas\, energetic talas\, and spellbinding improvisations. This concert promises to captivate both connoisseurs of classical music and new listeners\, celebrating the timeless beauty of Indian traditions through an innovative musical lens. \n

SUMMARY:Our Eternal Musical Tale
DESCRIPTION:\nAny musical piece has the power to teleport us to a certain moment or phase from our lifetimes. From being ecstatic to being in despair\, from being confused to being determined\, these musical pieces have the ability to take us through all those moments and phases from our lives instantly. \nThrough this concert\, each person in the audience revisits the countless emotions they once experienced in their lifetimes through the life story of the fictional character named ‘Rachanachar’. The epic journey that this hero went through in his lifetime\, and all the challenges he faced and conquered\, will be revisited through all original instrumental compositions. \nEach instrumental composition takes us through a certain point in the hero’s life journey and his mindset during that phase. The inter-reflective storyline lets us step inside the shoes of Rachanachar\, making us the hero of this eternal musical tale. \nSupported by: \n\n\n
