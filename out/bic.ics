SUMMARY:Chaturanga to Chess
DESCRIPTION:From boasting of a lone International Master (IM) in Manuel Aaron in 1962\, India has come a long way in the world of chess\, particularly in the last two-and-half decades of the new Millennium. Today\, India has 85 Grandmasters\, including three women\, 23 Woman Grand Masters\, 140 International Masters and 42 Woman International Masters while the list of FIDE masters is growing by the day. \nIn the top 10 of any category or age group\, Indians figure so prominently that they are second only to the US and China in the men’s and women’s section respectively. The double-gold at the 2024 Olympiad and India’s superb performance in the Candidates added to its growing reputation as a superpower. \nBut if you look from an historic perspective\, our champions of today are merely continuing the legacy of a 5\,000-year-old tradition which can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization when chess (called Chaturanga then) was\, among other things\, used for war stimulation. \nAccording to legend\, Ravan’s wife Mandodari taught him Chaturanga so that he could plan battle strategies. Later\, Chaturanga became Chatrang in Persian and Shatranj in Arabic before travelling to Spain and the rest of the western world. In the modern era\, chess is looked at in different ways. A gymnasium of the mind. A cerebral tug-of-war. \nFor India\, Anand can be the best reference point to start any debate involving chess. In fact\, Indian chess can be neatly divided into Pre-Anand and Post-Anand eras. The Pre-Anand period was nascent with not many players around\, no infrastructure to talk about or any support from the government or the private sector. Indian chess style was one of the many variants of the official chess as recognized by the ruling body FIDE. By the time Anand became India’s first Grandmaster in 1987 and triggered the post-Anand era\, chess was a rapidly growing sport. Let’s look at some figures. Till the start of the new Millennium\, India had just three GMs with Dibyendu Barua (1991) and Pravin Thipsay (1997) following in the footsteps of Anand. The first decade of the new century produced 20 GMs and the next 10 a staggering 44. The present decade has already witnessed 16 GMs to take the tally to 85. \nToday’s panel will discuss this phenomena and the reasons behind it\, the personalities involved\, look at the milestones crossed so far and the ones that are ahead as Indian chess passes through a Golden Era. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n\n

SUMMARY:Void and Verse
DESCRIPTION:Join us at the BIC Library for a Blackout Poetry event where you’ll get to transform pages from your favourite books into original poems. \nBlackout poetry is a unique form of artistic expression that involves taking an existing text\, often a page from a book\, newspaper\, or magazine\, and selectively blacking out or “blacking over” certain words and phrases to create a new\, cohesive\, and visually striking piece of poetry. \nCome with a few pages of text from a book you like (or peruse our selection)\, grab your marker and get started! Participants are given a dedicated period to create their blackout poetry. During this\, they flip through the pages of their choice\, looking for words or phrases that resonate with them\, and use markers to black out the remaining text. \nThe goal is to craft meaningful and visually engaging poems that personally resonates with you followed by a small sharing circle where you’ll get to read out your work! \n

SUMMARY:Manthan
DESCRIPTION:Manthan is a performance that brings together\, for the first time\, two ancient art forms from opposite corners of India—Kaavad storytelling from Rajasthan and Mohiniyattam dance from Kerala. Rooted in the myth of Samudra Manthan\, the churning of the ocean\, it unfolds as a series of seven symbolic ‘manthans’ or churnings\, exploring what it means to be human—psychologically\, emotionally\, philosophically\, and socially. \nThe performance emerges from a long process of research\, exploration\, and experimentation. It weaves original writing\, choreography\, and music into a layered structure of stories within stories\, drawing on Indian mythology alongside imagined and contemporary experiences. Themes of existence\, duality\, and the paradoxes of life surface through metaphor\, movement\, and voice. \nMohiniyattam\, known for its fluidity and depth\, brings grace and quiet power to the performance\, while the rarely-seen Kaavad Katha—supported by over six years of dedicated study—offers a rich narrative tradition that is both visual and oral. The Kaavad box opens and closes like a book\, revealing worlds within\, as the dancer and storyteller move in and out of each other’s rhythms. \nManthan holds space for the interplay of tradition and innovation\, creating a performance that is reflective\, immersive\, and intimate. Rather than offering answers\, it invites the audience into a shared space of reflection—where stories\, images\, and movement gently churn beneath the surface. The performance was first curated by Mayuri Upadhya and commissioned by Serendipity Arts Festival. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Gurudev and Bapu
DESCRIPTION:Gurudev and Bapu explores the extraordinary exchange of letters and ideas between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore\, set against the backdrop of the Indian freedom struggle. Over 25 years\, their correspondence reveals sharp differences on key issues—nationalism\, civil disobedience\, education—but also unwavering respect and affection between the two. \nTheir dialogue reflects a time in India’s history marked by thoughtful disagreement and political maturity—offering insights into how principled dissent and mutual regard can coexist. \nBangalore Little Theatre was honoured to present early performances of the play at places closely associated with Gandhi and Tagore—Sabarmati Ashram\, Santiniketan (Visva Bharati)\, and Thakurbari-Jorasanko (Rabindra Bharati). It has also been staged for the President of India. \nAdapted from the internationally acclaimed production with over 130 performances in India and abroad\, this staging promises a compelling reflection on two great minds and the values that shaped a nation. This performance is a tribute to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore’s enduring legacy\, presented around the time of his birth anniversary. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Raviraag: In the Light of Melody
DESCRIPTION:Commemorating the maestro’s 105th birth anniversary\, this morning concert pays tribute to Pt. Ravi Shankar\, the legendary sitar virtuoso whose artistry bridged tradition and innovation within Hindustani classical music. \nThe performance features vocal interpretations of two ragas conceived by Ravi Shankar—Raga Bairagi and Raga Natbhairav. Originally explored through the sitar\, these ragas will be reimagined in the vocal tradition\, offering a unique insight into their melodic essence. \nBoth morning ragas embody a serene\, meditative spirit\, inviting listeners into a space of peace and reflection. This concert stands as both a homage and a heartfelt musical offering to a musician whose legacy continues to inspire generations. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Mānushī – On a Quest
DESCRIPTION:Mānushī – On a Quest traces the spiritual and emotional journeys of four extraordinary women: the elusive River Saraswathi\, the devoted Meerabai\, the yearning mother Devaki\, and the mystic poet Akka Mahadevi. Rooted in literature\, poetry\, and deep personal exploration\, this Bharatanatyam solo presentation is the culmination of over two years of immersive research and creative engagement. \nThe performance opens with the mystical tale of Saraswathi\, inspired by the book The Lost River\, exploring whether the river still flows—physically and spiritually. We then journey with Meerabai\, who seeks her beloved Krishna through soulful bhajans marked by longing\, devotion\, and unanswered questions. Devaki’s poignant voice follows\, reflecting on the joys of motherhood she never fully experienced and her yearning to reclaim lost moments with her son\, Krishna. The production concludes with Akka Mahadevi\, whose powerful Vachanas guide us on a quest for liberation\, echoing the eternal human desire for union and truth. \nEach piece is supported by evocative compositions\, guided by literary scholars\, and brought to life through thoughtful choreography. \nSupported by: \n \n
