SUMMARY:Once Upon a Night in 1865: Blood Moon over Bengaluru
DESCRIPTION:Jul 4: 3pm – 5pm & 7pm – 9pm\nJul 5: 3pm – 5pm & 7pm – 9pm \nBlood Moon Over Bengaluru is an immersive theatre gameplay experience set in 1865\, inside the flickering shadows of a crumbling ancestral home in Indira Nagar. Guests are invited to a strange evening – part ritual\, part reckoning. At its center is Sugandha\, a young woman wasting away for reasons no one can explain. \nAcross three rounds of gameplay\, guests uncover fragments of a buried past. Some in the room are keepers of truth. Some are hiding something. One is not who they claim to be. \nInspired by gothic horror\, folklore\, and queer resistance\, Blood Moon Over Bengaluru is a mystery you live through. You are given secrets to protect and decisions to make. What you choose to reveal – or conceal – may shift the fate of an innocent. \nPlease note: Each session can only accommodate up to 20 participants. Participants must arrive on time\, as punctuality is a crucial part of the experience. Once the session begins\, late entries will not be permitted. Time is an important anchor in driving the experience. We will write to you on your registered email ID closer to the event date for final confirmation. \n

SUMMARY:The Third Moment
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the promise of equal citizenship begins to fade for one of the world’s largest Muslim populations? In today’s India\, the question is no longer theoretical\, but urgent and deeply personal for over 200 million people. \nThis session explores the shifting political landscape of Indian Muslims through the lens of Shikwa-e-Hind\, the new book by political scientist Mujibur Rehman. He examines what he calls their “third political moment\,” a phase marked by the erosion of constitutional equality and the rise of a majoritarian ethos since 2014. Tracing the arc from the aftermath of 1857\, through the hopeful vision of 1947\, to today’s polarised climate\, Rehman invites a critical look at the future of democratic participation for Indian Muslims. \nThe conversation features Mujibur Rehman in dialogue with author and columnist Aakar Patel and moderated by journalist Vikhar Ahmed Sayeed. They will explore the tension between constitutional ideals and majoritarian pressures\, the structural challenges of representation\, and the possibilities for reclaiming dignity\, rights\, and democratic participation for Indian Muslims. The session will conclude with a Q&A\, offering space for your questions in what promises to be an inclusive and engaging discussion. \n

SUMMARY:Two Many Things
DESCRIPTION:Many Things is a cross genre instrumental trio\, treading the fine line between composition and improvisation. The inventive tapestry of sound and music takes the listener on a journey full of twists and turns. \nTheir second album Two Many Things is still about the development of ideas in sound – spontaneous and instantaneous – but the compositional element is more pronounced\, with emphasis on structure\, where soloistic endeavors happen in a collective space. \nSupported by:\n \n

DESCRIPTION:What was the process of wealth generation and accumulation by the most prominent business community of South India?  A journey that was marked by risk and courage; a journey that carried them to the greener pastures of South and Southeast Asia; and a journey that was shaped by the power of global events. \nIn this conversation\, scholar Prof. Carol Upadhya and veteran journalist K N Hari Kumar and Prof. Raman Mahadevan shall unravel and illuminate not only the making\, but also the relative weakening\, of the Nattukottai Chettiars as a business community\, and the significance of their journey for our times. \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Precarious Lives\, Fraught Selves
DESCRIPTION:Thanuja: A Memoir of Migration and Transition is the first memoir by a Sri Lankan Tamil transwoman who is now a German citizen. The recently published English translation has been gaining attention across social media for its powerful account of gender\, displacement\, and resilience across continents. \nThis session reflects on the layered process of translating Thanuja Singam’s life story\, not only across languages but also across histories\, geographies\, and identity formations. In placing the memoir in dialogue with the expanding field of Indian trans literature\, the discussion opens up questions around how language shapes identity\, how trans voices find space on the page\, and how literary traditions both support and constrain such narratives. \nThe conversation will engage with the evolving landscape of trans writing in South Asia\, examining the literary\, political\, and affective threads that connect diverse trans experiences. It also considers how translation can serve as a bridge between communities\, turning individual testimony into collective memory. \n

SUMMARY:The Untold Stories of the Indian Rupee
DESCRIPTION:Indian paper money has a rich history\, filled with numerous fascinating stories and unique aspects that reflect the country’s diverse heritage and evolving economy. \nOne of the most remarkable pieces is the only surviving ancient paper note of India\, which was circulated during the British colonial period. Equally significant is the first One Rupee note issued in 1917\, marking the early stages of formal paper currency in the country. Among the rare denominations is the unusual Two and a Half Rupees note\, which stands out for its distinct value and limited circulation. \nThe influence of foreign colonial powers is also evident in the paper money issued by the Portuguese and French in their respective territories in India. Additionally\, several princely states across the subcontinent issued their own forms of paper currency\, showcasing the regional autonomy and diversity of pre-independence India. \nOther intriguing aspects include the issuance of Prisoners of War Camp Money and the use of paper cash coupons as a substitute for currency in certain regions. A rare and noteworthy event in monetary history is the Reserve Bank of India’s simultaneous issuance of currency notes for two different countries—an occurrence seldom seen elsewhere. \nIndia has also seen the release of commemorative banknotes on a single known occasion\, adding a unique dimension to its numismatic record. More recently\, the 2016 demonetisation marked a historic turning point\, acting as a catalyst for increased digital economy awareness and financial literacy across the nation. \nIn this session\, Mr. Rezwan Razack dives into some fascinating anecdotes of Indian paper money. He’ll also be in conversation with Ramjee Chandran about the evolving nature of currency in India. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:EK Janaki Ammal & the Re-Ordering of the Western Ghats
DESCRIPTION:The Western Ghats enjoyed a central place in the life and science of cytogeneticist E. K. Janaki Ammal (1897-1984). To her\, the dense and tall tropical evergreen forests found here was the epitome of climax vegetation in India\, or the mature stage of ecological succession. In order to understand how this balance was reached and stability attained\, she undertook a grand and pioneering project— a study of the relationship between peoples and plants of the region\, both in deep history and the immediate present. One of her chief aims was the making of a modern and decolonialised version of the Hortus Malabaricus— a new compendium of medicinal plants from the Western Ghats\, reordered on the basis of chromosomes\, and containing information on their uses\, as gathered from the forest dwellers\, who she believed were the primary interlocutors of indigenous medico-botanical knowledge. Also\, quite tellingly\, in her advancing years\, rather than expend energy directly wrestling with the Kerala government on the Silent Valley issue\, she championed for its conservation by mobilising international support and creatively embarked on an innovative project— the cytogenetics of the flora of these undisturbed forests. \nThis lecture is part of the Obaid Siddiqi Lectures\, Annual lectures delivered by the Obaid Siddiqi Chair in the History and Culture of Science at the Archives at NCBS. \nIn collaboration with \n     \n

SUMMARY:What Would Ambedkar Have Made of the Republic of India Today?
DESCRIPTION:B. R. Ambedkar is remembered and admired for many things: for his heroic\, lifelong\, campaign to eradicate the evil of untouchability; for his scholarly contributions as an economist and social theorist; for the social movements he led and the political parties he founded; for the educational institutions he nurtured; for his critical role in overseeing and directing the framing of the Constitution; for the brilliant books\, essays and pamphlets that he authored on a variety of subjects. \nThis lecture will focus on Ambedkar as a visionary and deeply insightful theorist of constitutional democracy. By juxtaposing what he said in his speeches in the Constituent Assembly to the social and political realities of contemporary India\, I shall demonstrate how his ideas remain of compelling relevance to us today. While the core of the talk will be on Ambedkar the political theorist\, it will end by briefly comparing his legacy with that of other remarkable Indians of his generation\, such as Nehru\, Gandhi\, Tagore\, and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The History of Welfare
DESCRIPTION:Why does welfare feel out of reach for so many\, even as governments promise more than ever? \nWelfare schemes and cash transfers are central to India’s political economy today. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press\, 2025) recounts the crucial history of how welfare has evolved in India over the past century. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day\, the book asks important questions\, illuminates failures and brings clarity to our murky future. \nAuthor Louise Tillin in conversation with Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan\, moderated by Arun Thiruvengadam\, will explore what India’s welfare journey means for citizens\, workers\, and voters today. \nCurious about where your taxes go\, or why support doesn’t always reach those who need it most? Stay for the Q&A and bring your questions. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair\, NLS.  \n
