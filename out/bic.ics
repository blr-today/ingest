SUMMARY:364. Repositioning Indian Aesthetics
DESCRIPTION:Kirtinath Kurtkoti (1928-2003) belongs to the rare but powerful tradition of multilingual literary and cultural criticism in India. His oeuvre encompasses commentaries on the entire spectrum of Kannada literature\, from the earliest extant writings to late twentieth-century works. Kurtkoti’s critical works highlight the unique sensibility of the Kannada literary tradition\, placing it in the broader context of Indian and world literature. \nCourtesy of Criticism brings some of his important essays on Kannada literature to non-Kannada readers. Divided into three sections— Literary History\, Literary Theory\, and Literary Criticism—the book showcases 31 short and long essays of Kurtkoti’s essential writings. The book has a twofold purpose: to introduce the significant body of Kurtkoti’s works and\, through these essays\, to highlight the significant strands of the Kannada literary tradition. Courtesy of Criticism demonstrates the subtle ways in which a mind\, enriched by its own traditions and eclectic literacy\, can transcend received structures of knowledge. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks\, NS Gundur will be in conversation with Shri Chandrashekhar Kambara\, M S Ashadevi and Kamalakar Bhat. This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in March 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere\, including Apple Podcasts\, Spotify\, Google Podcasts\, Castbox\, Overcast\, Audible\, and Amazon Music. \n

SUMMARY:Against the Tide
DESCRIPTION:97 minutes | Koli\, Marathi and Hindi with English subtitles | 2023 | India \nAgainst the Tide follows Bombay fishermen Rakesh and Ganesh\, both belonging to the indigenous Koli community and inheritors of a rich\, ancestral knowledge system—one that reads the sea through the moon and tides. Rakesh continues to place his faith in these traditional methods\, while Ganesh embraces modern fishing technologies in search of more secure returns. As climate change renders the sea increasingly unpredictable\, the pressure to provide for their families begins to fracture their once-unshakeable friendship. \nA deeply human story set against the vast\, changing waters of the Arabian Sea\, Against the Tide explores the collision of tradition and technology\, community and survival\, through the intimate bond between two men as close as brothers. \nThe film was selected for the Sundance Film Festival 2023 – World Cinema Documentary Competition\, where it received widespread acclaim for its lyrical storytelling and urgent relevance. \nProduction Crew:Director & Producer – Sarvnik KaurProducer – Koval BhatiaCo-Producer – Quentin LaurentEditing – Atanas GeorgievEditing – Blagoja NedelkovskiSound Design – Moinak Bose \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Queer
DESCRIPTION:135 minutes | English with English subtitles | Italy & USA | 2024 \nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\nStarring: Daniel Craig\, Drew Starkey\, Jason Schwartzman\, Henrique Zaga\, Drew Droege\, Andra Ursuta\, Ariel Schulman\, and others.\nWritten by: Justin Kuritzkes\, based on the novel by William S. Burroughs\nMusic: Trent Reznor\, Atticus Ross\, and Caetano Veloso \nSet in 1950s Mexico City\, Queer follows William Lee\, an American expat living in quiet solitude until he meets Eugene Allerton\, a fellow expatriate and former soldier. Their encounter stirs the possibility of a profound and intimate connection. Adapted from William S. Burroughs’ novel\, the film transforms the raw emotional narrative into a tender\, richly human story of love and longing. \nDirected by Luca Guadagnino\, Queer reimagines Burroughs’ work not as a tale of unrequited desire but as a universal story of love — a delicate interplay between vulnerability\, misconnection\, and emotional truth. \nAs a nod to Pride month\, we chose Queer to kick off our collaboration with MUBI for the nuanced narrative and unique storytelling it offers. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience!  \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Treasures of History

SUMMARY:Revisiting Tamil History
DESCRIPTION:Nearly 90 million Tamil people\, spread across India and a vibrant global diaspora\, have preserved a distinct cultural identity while continuously evolving through time\, geography\, and social transformation. One of the world’s oldest continuous cultures\, the Tamil community continues to leave a powerful imprint on literature\, philosophy\, politics\, science\, the arts\, and beyond. \nIn her book The Tamils\, Nirmala Lakshman speaks about the origins of Tamil civilization\, from the Stone Age and the Sangam era to the Bhakti movement and colonial history\, and how these shaped the Tamil consciousness. \nTogether with Ranvir Shah\, she will delve into the themes of the book and also address the complexities that mark Tamil society today\, including intersections of caste\, religion\, gender\, and modernity\, and reflect on what it means to be Tamil in the 21st century. Themes such as migration\, resilience\, identity\, and creativity will be explored as the speakers examine how Tamil culture continues to thrive and adapt in an ever-globalising world. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Queering Law
DESCRIPTION:What would justice look like if it spoke in a queer voice? How might legal judgments shift if they were written through the lived experiences and realities of LGBTQIA+ individuals? \nIn this session\, we explore the bold and imaginative work of The Queer Judgments Project\, an initiative that seeks to re-think\, re-write\, and re-invent legal judgments through queer and complementary perspectives. Emerging from a series of conversations among scholars\, activists\, and legal thinkers\, the project asks a vital question: how could legal decisions involving sexual orientation\, gender identity and expression\, and sex characteristics be expressed differently\, more inclusively\, more justly? \nAt the heart of the discussion is the project’s first major output: an edited collection that offers 26 re-imagined judgments and commentaries from across the globe. Through this collection\, contributors bring their diverse disciplinary backgrounds and personal insights to bear on the law\, queering traditional frameworks and imagining alternative approaches to legal reasoning. \nThis session will engage with the creative\, critical\, and deeply personal work that underpins these re-written judgments. It will reflect on how the project aims not just to critique existing legal structures but to open up new possibilities for justice that better reflect the experiences of LGBTQIA+ and other minoritized communities. \nThis year\, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is — unconforming\, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates\, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society\, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression. Pride\, Insists Upon Itself! \n

SUMMARY:Abhang Mela
DESCRIPTION:Abhang is a genre of classical music from Maharashtra\, primarily sung in praise of Sri Vitthala of Pandharpur. The term Abhang means no ending or no interruption. Over 10\,000 Abhangs were composed by various Sants of Maharashtra\, including Sant Dnyaneshwar\, Sant Eknath\, Sant Tukaram\, Sant Namdev\, and Sant Janabhai. Emerging from the Bhakti Sampradaya in the 12th century\, Abhangs have become integral to Concerts and Bhajans. Varkaris (devotees of Sri Vitthala) sing Abhangs while walking towards Pandharpur. Sri. Purandaradasa adopted the name ‘Purandara Vitthala’ as his ankitanama\, as ‘Vitthala’ was his Ishta Murti\, while the name ‘Purandara’ was bestowed upon him by his guru\, Sri Vyasa Raya. \nUma Kumar\, Carnatic Singer from Switzerland\, and the ensemble will perform 12 Abhangs composed by 10 composers\, set in 12 different Hindustani ragas and presented in both on-beat and off-beat rhythms. She will render these Abhangs in the Carnatic style\, accompanied by Violin and Mridangam\, while complementing the sound with Tabla and Manjira to fully express these divine compositions’ deep emotions. \nAbhang Mela aims to create a musical symphony\, blending the bhava from singing\, the nada from the Violin\, the laya from the Tabla and Mridangam\, and the high-pitched rhythms from the Manjira\, alongside the melodious sound of the Tanpura. Music lovers are invited to enjoy this unique musical experience. \nPresented by: \nUma Kumar \n

SUMMARY:The History of Welfare
DESCRIPTION:Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press\, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day\, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment\, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India’s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development\, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of ‘direct benefits’ which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session\, Louise Tillin\, the author of the book\, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair\, NLS.  \n
