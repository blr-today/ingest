SUMMARY:The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience
DESCRIPTION:As the climate crisis deepens\, it becomes ever more urgent to ask: Who bears the burden? Who holds the wisdom? \nThis year’s Environment Day programming centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. \nRather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. From fisherwomen on the coast to forest guardians\, waste workers\, farmers\, and displaced families\, the day invites us to witness\, to engage\, and to reimagine a just\, inclusive response to ecological breakdown. \nThrough performances\, conversations\, and hands-on workshops\, we explore not only what is vanishing\, but what must be protected\, restored\, and re-rooted. \nSchedule: \nTasting Climate Change: Could Coffee as We Know It Vanish?\n11am – 8pm | Exhibition | Black Baza Coffee\nLink to know more. \nThe Earth Remembers: Climate Change through Cartoons\n11am – 8pm | Exhibition | Open Call\nLink to know more. \nLeafy Tales for Little Explorers: Discover the World of Leaves Through Stories\, Play\, and Wonder!\n11am – 1pm | Kids’ Workshop | Harini Nagendra & APU\nLink to know more. \nMy Otter Diary: Playful\, Resilient Otters in India’s Shifting Waterways\n11am – 12:30pm | Screening & Conversation | Sugandhi Gadadhar\, Rana Belur & Shivu\nLink to know more. \nWhat on Earth?!: An Offbeat Quiz to Ground You in Planet-Friendly Fun and Facts\n2pm – 3:30pm | Quiz | Berty Ashley\nLink to know more. \nBreaking the Nets: An Oral History of India’s Fisherwomen\n4pm – 5:30pm | Screening & Conversation | Shamsheer Yousaf\, Monica Jha\, Sriram Vittalamurthy & Lakshmi Murthy\nLink to know more. \nEvery Grain a Story: Mapping Self & Culture Through Rice Appreciation: A Sensory Workshop on Heirloom Rice\, Memory\, & Food Culture\n4pm – 5:30pm | Workshop | Edible Archives \nHuliyappa – A Retelling: Faith\, Compassion and Conservation\n6pm – 7pm | Screening & Conversation | Sourabha Rao\, Santosh Saligram\, Rakesh Kote\, Anusha Hegde & Sonu Venugopal\nLink to know more. \nBound by Soil: A Requiem for the Forgotten: Progress Asks for Offerings; The Earth Has Long Borne the Altar\n8pm – 9pm | Performance | Anuradha Venkataraman\nLink to know more. \n

SUMMARY:My Otter Diary
DESCRIPTION:52 minutes | English and Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 | India \nIndia’s smooth-coated otters are captivating animals with distinct characters and intricate social lives. In this documentary\, wildlife filmmaker Sugandhi Gadadhar explores the playful and resilient lives of an otter family residing in one of India’s most rapidly changing waterways. \nThe banks of the River Cauvery are where Sugandhi spent her childhood holidays. The memories of those times and her fleeting glimpses of the mysterious animals dipping below the waterline have fascinated her ever since. \nNow she is back and with the help of Shivu\, a local fisherman\, is following Maya\, a female otter\, and her family in the hope of documenting their family dynamics\, challenges\, and achievements. But the otters are wary of her presence. They have learnt that staying elusive means staying alive. \nShivu grew up along the banks of the river Cauvery. He not only helps Sugandhi navigate the waters but also opens her eyes to the lives of fishermen and the problems they face.\nAs pollution and destructive dynamite fishing threaten the delicate balance of their habitat\, the otters and the fishermen\, whose livelihoods also depend on the river\, are often in conflict. \nNot many people know that otters exist in India. An otter is to a river what a tiger is to a forest. They are the apex predators in the river. Set along the picturesque landscape of the river Cauvery in southern India\, this film captures never-before-filmed otter behaviour while subtly articulating the conflict that is brewing. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers and Shivu. \nThis screening is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Tasting Climate Change
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a world with no coffee! Scientists say that by 2050\, your favourite brew could very likely go extinct from changing climate – or at the very least leave you with an unpleasant taste in your cup! \nJoin us for an insightful experience to discover how climate change could affect the flavour of coffee. Of particular interest is a climate reality – what is the evidence that climate change is occurring in coffee\, how would we experience and indeed taste its impact? \nTo discover this\, participants will be encouraged to sample different coffees as an invitation to taste climate change. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Breaking the Nets
DESCRIPTION:25 minutes (2 films) | Bengali and Tamil with English Subtitles | India | 2024 \nThe films are part of a series Breaking the Nets: An oral history of India’s fisherwomen. At the heart of the fishing industry is the invisible labour of women. Over 12.3 million women in India work in fishing— catching\, farming\, processing\, and selling fish\, mending nets\, and maintaining fishing gear. But their contribution is largely unacknowledged. Fisherwomen have fought to get recognition for their labour and secure their rights. “Breaking the Nets” brings stories from across India that chronicle the discriminations fisherwomen have faced\, the battles they have waged\, and the solutions they have crafted. \nFilm 1: This Jungle is Ours \n12 min | Bengali with English subtitles\nUrmila Sardar saw a tiger drag her husband away while they were fishing in the Sundarbans. Parul Haldar had to abandon building a temple dedicated to the forest deity when her husband was killed by a tiger. Still\, they defy the Forest Department to work in this mangrove forest\, facing the threat of tigers\, crocodiles\, and snakes. Catching fish and crab has been the sole means for women here to earn a living. With the creation of the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve\, the government has restricted people’s access to the forest\, and made women’s jobs difficult. Increased frequency of storms and cyclones caused by climate change has added to their woes. Now\, fisherwomen are demanding customary harvest rights in Sundarban. \nFilm 2: The Sea is our Mother\n13 min | Tamil with English subtitles\nNamma Thayi has been diving in the Gulf of Mannar to pick seaweed since she was seven. She couldn’t miss work even when heavily pregnant. On one such dive\, she delivered her child on an island. Today\, as a frail 80-year-old\, she still goes to the sea to collect seaweed. The women around the islands of Gulf of Mannar have carved a niche for themselves as India’s sole wild seaweed harvesters. For them\, diving in the sea is not an act of recreation or adventure\, but a means to their livelihood. With the creation of the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park\, their places of work have come under legal protection for their rich biodiversity. The National Park is also a ‘no-take’ zone\, denying them their traditional fishing grounds and seaweed beds. Over 5\,000 seaweed collectors have their livelihoods at stake. How do women dependent on protected areas survive in the time of conservation? \nThis project is created by a ‘tiny team’ of three independent journalists Shamsheer Yousaf\, Monica Jha\, and Sriram Vittalamurthy. They did everything from reporting\, writing\, shooting and editing photos and videos\, and producing multimedia stories\, debugging the code and troubleshooting. It was supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers and Lakshmi Murthy\, a seaweed harvester turned leader. \nIn collaboration with: \n     \nThis screening is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Every Grain a Story: Mapping Self and Culture Through Rice Appreciation
DESCRIPTION:India has over a lakh rice varieties – each with its own story. A grain that can ease certain illnesses. Another that grows tall enough to hide elephants. One that needs no cooking. A variety so flavourful it’s eaten plain. A Goan rice that thrives during floods. Yet\, most of these never reach markets or our kitchens\, slipping out of everyday memory and conversation. This workshop\, led by Anumitra from Edible Archives\, invites participants to explore the edible archive within themselves – the foods and tastes we carry in our bodies and memories. Through a guided rice appreciation session featuring indigenous rice varieties\, we’ll learn to observe differences in texture\, aroma\, and flavour while uncovering the stories behind each grain. \nThe workshop is a space to reflect on the connections between food\, place\, and identity. It will also open up conversations about what gets lost when agricultural biodiversity disappears\, and why bringing these grains back to our plates matters. \nIn collaboration with Edible Archives: Edible Archives\, an award-winning restaurant and art /research project based in Anjuna\, Goa\, works with indigenous ingredients at the intersection of art\, culture and food. Edible Archives was one of the Infra Projects at the Kochi Muziris Biennale 2018-19\, where it showcased 30 varieties of indigenous rice in 3 months. Since then\, Edible Archives has been at the forefront of the ingredient-driven movement in India. With its focus on indigenous varieties\, local and seasonal ingredients\, and innovative cuisine-agnostic menus that change with the seasons\, it has been introducing visitors to an intriguing world of local foods as never imagined before. Most recently\, Edible Archives was the winner of the national Outlook Responsible Tourism Awards 2025\, both in the Sustainable Food category and as the Overall Winner. \nIn collaboration with: \n    \nThis workshop is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Huliyappa – A Retelling
DESCRIPTION:15 minutes | Kannada with English subtitles | 2025 | India \nHuliyappa is a short documentary in Kannada by first-time filmmaker\, Sourabha Rao. Shot entirely in the remote hamlets of the Uttara Kannada district\, the film is centred around an ancient custom of worshipping the eponymous tiger deity during Deepavali\, for the protection of people and their livestock from large Carnivora – tigers\, leopards and bears. \nThe film reveals the losses faced by the residents of this thickly forested Western Ghats landscape to themselves and their prized cattle due to incidents with wildlife\, and the surprising tolerance\, forgiveness and compassion that prevail in people despite them. It is an exploration of the mythical\, emotional and rational origins of the remarkable faith. Through conversations with people from various strata of the local society\, including scholars\, farmers and cowherds\, Rao makes a concise and compelling retelling of a culture that has maintained the unlikeliest harmony between humans and wildlife in the region for centuries\, and documents the simple rituals that constitute it. \nRather soberingly\, Huliyappa is also a timely reminder of the dire need to impress such indigenous practices upon a generation increasingly disconnected from its roots\, if the equilibrium with Nature\, so pivotal to the future of humanity\, is to be vouchsafed. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with the team that made the film\, in conversation with Sonu Venugopal. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis screening is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:Bound by Soil: A Requiem for the Forgotten
DESCRIPTION:Inspired by ONV Kurup’s evocative Malayalam poem Bhoomikaorru Charmageetham\, a requiem to the Earth\, this production mournfully echoes the planet’s anguish as it witnesses the destruction of its progeny and the desecration of its sacred body. Drawing from ancient myths of forests sacrificed for the march of civilization to the modern plundering of natural resources\, the narrative weaves a searing commentary on humanity’s parasitic progression. It lays bare the devastating impact of ecological imbalance\, exposing how the relentless pursuit of growth comes at the expense of both nature and the lives of marginalized communities that remain intimately bound to it. \nThis performance is part of BIC’s programmes for Environment Day 2025 titled The Earth Remembers: Stories of Justice and Resilience. This year’s Environment Day gathering centres on the people at the frontlines of ecological change\, communities whose lives are entangled with the land\, the waters\, and the skies\, and who carry not only the weight of loss but also the seeds of resilience. Rather than viewing the environment as separate from society\, we listen to stories where the two are inseparable. \n

SUMMARY:A Perfect Storm
DESCRIPTION:What happens when a defiant chronicler and an idealist revolutionary converge in the playground that is India’s freedom struggle? Urdu newspaper Pratap\, launched in pre-partition India\, was a torchbearer against the British Raj. The man who publicly defended it against colonial censorship was none other than Jawaharlal Nehru. \nThe pen picked up by freedom fighter Virendra\, the paper’s editor and the founder’s son who once walked shoulder to shoulder with stalwarts like Bhagat Singh was equally fearless despite threats by the imperial government\, Indira Gandhi’s Emergency and a parcel bomb sent to Pratap’s office during terrorism in Punjab. \nVirendra was first arrested in the historic Saunders murder case. He was also in jail with Bhagat Singh the day the legendary revolutionary was hanged\, sharing a rare first-hand witness account. In Independent India\, too footsteps filled Pratap and its editors with dread and terror. \nPratap: A Defiant Newspaper is a timely reminder of the ethos of a struggle\, a template for speaking truth to power at all costs. It is the story of a perfect storm. The book is written by Virendra’s son\, distinguished editor Chander Mohan and journalist granddaughter Jyotsna Mohan. Jyotsna and Azeezullah Baig will be in conversation with Maya Sharma. There will be a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Dear You\, Dear Me
DESCRIPTION:Put your pen and heart to paper in a playful yet introspective letter-writing gathering that celebrates the many shades of queer. Whether you’re writing to your past self\, a future love\, a family member (chosen or otherwise) or even a concept\, take this moment to express\, reflect on and connect with queerness in all its ups and downs. All people and identities are welcome. \nCome as you are\, write what you feel and sign off with pride. \nThis year\, BIC celebrates Pride Month through a series of programs that embrace Queerness as it is — unconforming\, changing and alternative. Every program aims to embody the fluid and non-normative possibilities of existence that queerness creates\, while fostering a community that welcomes difference in an unbending society\, whether that be through new models of living or unique modes of self-expression. Pride\, Insists Upon Itself! \n

SUMMARY:Muthuswami Dikshitar: Looking Back After 250 Years
DESCRIPTION:If the century spanning 1850 to 1950 was that of Tyagaraja\, the next one undoubtedly belongs to Muthuswami Dikshitar. He has been the subject of the same intense study that his illustrious contemporary was previously. The corpus of his songs in public circulation has gone up tremendously during this period\, though debates continue on the genuineness of some of these. This is exactly the way Tyagaraja kritis went up in circulation and publications were churned out on them from the mid-19th century onwards. Dikshitar like a late-blooming flower is slowly unfurling petal after petal\, revealing some\, but not all the facets of his personality. There is something about him that seems to speak to the 21st century mind. \nThis lecture by Historian\, V Sriram will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. \nPresented by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Against the Tide
DESCRIPTION:97 minutes | Koli\, Marathi and Hindi with English subtitles | 2023 | India \nAgainst the Tide follows Bombay fishermen Rakesh and Ganesh\, both belonging to the indigenous Koli community and inheritors of a rich\, ancestral knowledge system—one that reads the sea through the moon and tides. Rakesh continues to place his faith in these traditional methods\, while Ganesh embraces modern fishing technologies in search of more secure returns. As climate change renders the sea increasingly unpredictable\, the pressure to provide for their families begins to fracture their once-unshakeable friendship. \nA deeply human story set against the vast\, changing waters of the Arabian Sea\, Against the Tide explores the collision of tradition and technology\, community and survival\, through the intimate bond between two men as close as brothers. \nThe film was selected for the Sundance Film Festival 2023 – World Cinema Documentary Competition\, where it received widespread acclaim for its lyrical storytelling and urgent relevance. \nThe screening will be followed by a conversation between the Director\, Sarvnik Kaur and Sunanda Bhat\, along with an audience Q&A. \nProduction Crew:Director & Producer – Sarvnik KaurProducer – Koval BhatiaCo-Producer – Quentin LaurentEditing – Atanas GeorgievEditing – Blagoja NedelkovskiSound Design – Moinak Bose \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Queer
DESCRIPTION:135 minutes | English with English subtitles | Italy & USA | 2024 \nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\nStarring: Daniel Craig\, Drew Starkey\, Jason Schwartzman\, Henrique Zaga\, Drew Droege\, Andra Ursuta\, Ariel Schulman\, and others.\nWritten by: Justin Kuritzkes\, based on the novel by William S. Burroughs\nMusic: Trent Reznor\, Atticus Ross\, and Caetano Veloso \nSet in 1950s Mexico City\, Queer follows William Lee\, an American expat living in quiet solitude until he meets Eugene Allerton\, a fellow expatriate and former soldier. Their encounter stirs the possibility of a profound and intimate connection. Adapted from William S. Burroughs’ novel\, the film transforms the raw emotional narrative into a tender\, richly human story of love and longing. \nDirected by Luca Guadagnino\, Queer reimagines Burroughs’ work not as a tale of unrequited desire but as a universal story of love — a delicate interplay between vulnerability\, misconnection\, and emotional truth. \nAs a nod to Pride month\, we chose Queer to kick off our collaboration with MUBI for the nuanced narrative and unique storytelling it offers. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience!  \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Revisiting Tamil History
DESCRIPTION:Nearly 90 million Tamil people\, spread across India and a vibrant global diaspora\, have preserved a distinct cultural identity while continuously evolving through time\, geography\, and social transformation. One of the world’s oldest continuous cultures\, the Tamil community continues to leave a powerful imprint on literature\, philosophy\, politics\, science\, the arts\, and beyond. \nIn her book The Tamils\, Nirmala Lakshman speaks about the origins of Tamil civilization\, from the Stone Age and the Sangam era to the Bhakti movement and colonial history\, and how these shaped the Tamil consciousness. \nTogether with Ranvir Shah\, she will delve into the themes of the book and also address the complexities that mark Tamil society today\, including intersections of caste\, religion\, gender\, and modernity\, and reflect on what it means to be Tamil in the 21st century. Themes such as migration\, resilience\, identity\, and creativity will be explored as the speakers examine how Tamil culture continues to thrive and adapt in an ever-globalising world. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Queering Law
DESCRIPTION:What would justice look like if it spoke in a queer voice? How might legal judgments shift if they were written through the lived experiences and realities of LGBTQIA+ individuals? \nIn this session\, we explore the bold and imaginative work of The Queer Judgments Project\, an initiative that seeks to re-think\, re-write\, and re-invent legal judgments through queer and complementary perspectives. Emerging from a series of conversations among scholars\, activists\, and legal thinkers\, the project asks a vital question: how could legal decisions involving sexual orientation\, gender identity and expression\, and sex characteristics be expressed differently\, more inclusively\, more justly? \nAt the heart of the discussion is the project’s first major output: an edited collection that offers 26 re-imagined judgments and commentaries from across the globe. Through this collection\, contributors bring their diverse disciplinary backgrounds and personal insights to bear on the law\, queering traditional frameworks and imagining alternative approaches to legal reasoning. \nThis session will engage with the creative\, critical\, and deeply personal work that underpins these re-written judgments. It will reflect on how the project aims not just to critique existing legal structures but to open up new possibilities for justice that better reflect the experiences of LGBTQIA+ and other minoritized communities. \n

SUMMARY:Abhang Mela
DESCRIPTION:Abhang is a genre of classical music from Maharashtra\, primarily sung in praise of Sri Vitthala of Pandharpur. The term Abhang means no ending or no interruption. Over 10\,000 Abhangs were composed by various Sants of Maharashtra\, including Sant Dnyaneshwar\, Sant Eknath\, Sant Tukaram\, Sant Namdev\, and Sant Janabhai. Emerging from the Bhakti Sampradaya in the 12th century\, Abhangs have become integral to Concerts and Bhajans. Varkaris (devotees of Sri Vitthala) sing Abhangs while walking towards Pandharpur. Sri. Purandaradasa adopted the name ‘Purandara Vitthala’ as his ankitanama\, as ‘Vitthala’ was his Ishta Murti\, while the name ‘Purandara’ was bestowed upon him by his guru\, Sri Vyasa Raya. \nUma Kumar\, Carnatic Singer from Switzerland\, and the ensemble will perform 12 Abhangs composed by 10 composers\, set in 12 different Hindustani ragas and presented in both on-beat and off-beat rhythms. She will render these Abhangs in the Carnatic style\, accompanied by Violin and Mridangam\, while complementing the sound with Tabla and Manjira to fully express these divine compositions’ deep emotions. \nAbhang Mela aims to create a musical symphony\, blending the bhava from singing\, the nada from the Violin\, the laya from the Tabla and Mridangam\, and the high-pitched rhythms from the Manjira\, alongside the melodious sound of the Tanpura. Music lovers are invited to enjoy this unique musical experience. \nPresented by: \nUma Kumar \n

SUMMARY:The History of Welfare
DESCRIPTION:Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press\, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day\, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment\, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India’s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development\, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of ‘direct benefits’ which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session\, Louise Tillin\, the author of the book\, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair\, NLS.  \n
