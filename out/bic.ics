SUMMARY:Un.Divided Identities
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: 11 am | Wednesday\, 6 Aug\nExhibition Timings: 11 am – 8 pm\nExhibition on show until: 8 pm | Sunday\, 10 Aug \nWalkthroughs:\n4 pm | Saturday\, 9 Aug (followed by a ‘meet the team’ at 5 pm)\n4 pm | Sunday\, 10 Aug \nPartition: Memory\, Responsibility\, and Voice (Panel Discussion): 11 am – 12:30 pm | Saturday\, 9 Aug | Auditorium \nUn.Divided Identities is an interactive choice-based digital exhibition on the 1947 Partition of the Indian subcontinent. Originally launched online in 2022 by ReReeti in partnership with the British Council and Glasgow Life Museums\, this exhibition is now being reimagined as a physical\, immersive experience. It is especially relevant for young people who have only ever encountered Partition through textbook chapters and distorted narratives. \nCurated by ReReeti\, designed by Aditi Dhamija\, and in collaboration with the Bangalore International Centre\, this exhibition urges participants to deeply feel the emotional weight of forced\, mass migration. The digital interactives serve as the core touch point\, but the stories extend beyond the screen. Spilling into the physical space as tactile\, atmospheric\, and visually compelling encounters\, visitors navigate through stories of displacement – stories based on real accounts of families. You will face difficult choices on behalf of characters\, driven by fear\, survival\, and the need to protect their families. \nWhile Partition impacted families across the subcontinent\, its realities are often distant in southern India. This exhibition opens space for reflection and conversation\, prompting visitors to connect personally with questions of identity\, loss\, memory\, and inter-generational resilience. \nThe hope is to change how future generations choose to carry our history forward. \nPlease note: Kids below age 6 will not be allowed inside the Gallery space. \nClick here to know more about the Panel Discussion. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Split Screens
DESCRIPTION:A daring literary experiment\, explored through the eyes of the author herself! \nThis evening authors Meena Kandasamy and Sam Arni will delve into the innovative split-screen structure of Kandasamy’s revolutionary book\, Exquisite Cadavers. Together\, they will discuss how experimentation of form confronts literary expectations\, challenges the marginalization of writers from the Global South\, and connects the intimate landscapes of relationships to broader public histories. \nUnlike a painter’s or potter’s studio where you can watch art come alive\, the writer’s creative process is usually hidden\, mysterious\, almost alchemical. Exquisite Cadavers is Meena Kandasamy’s take on the novel-in-the-margins format. The story of Maya and Karim – lovers navigating the complexities of migration\, racial identity\, and political uncertainty in Brexit-era London – unfold only on half the pages. Juxtaposed with Kandasamy’s candid reflections on her own life experiences\, the book provides a unique view into a writer’s process of creation. \nJoin us for a disarmingly honest conversation on polemics\, protests\, and power. \n

SUMMARY:The Open Couple
DESCRIPTION:Language: English \nWhen the rules of love are rewritten\, what’s left standing? \nDario Fo’s The Open Couple is a bold\, sharp\, and darkly comic exploration of modern relationships pushed to the edge. What begins as a provocative experiment (a husband proposing an open marriage) quickly spirals into chaos\, confrontation\, and unexpected revelations. \nSet against the backdrop of shifting gender roles and social expectations\, the play peels back the layers of a marriage unravelling. With biting wit and disarming vulnerability\, Fo exposes the emotional toll of jealousy\, the absurdity of control\, and the fragile line between freedom and fear. The couple’s battles are fast\, funny\, and painfully familiar\, as they try to navigate the messy terrain of love\, power\, and identity. \nThrough its rapid dialogue and theatrical twists\, The Open Couple holds up a mirror to our ideas of commitment and connection; asking what we’re really seeking when we ask for more. \nA deeply human comedy that leaves room for both laughter and reckoning. \nCredits:\nWriter : Dario Fo\nDirector : Faraz Khan\nCreative Producer : Ragini Roychowdhury\nActors : Vaishali Bisht & Rohan Joshi\nSound : Charvi Ojha \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Partition: Memory\, Responsibility & Voice
DESCRIPTION:How do we honour truths without exploitation or erasure? \nThis panel discussion will explore how the chapter of Partition is remembered\, who holds the responsibility of preserving its stories\, and what it means to give them an honest voice. Through literature\, oral testimony\, archives\, or immersive media\, each speaker has engaged with histories marked by silence\, trauma\, and survival. In this session\, they will reflect on the choices they have made: to amplify certain voices\, to tell different stories with care\, and to avoid reducing complex truths into simplified narratives. \nAt the heart of this conversation is a shared responsibility; not only as writers\, educators\, or artists\, but as individuals shaped by inherited memory. As Partition fades from lived memory\, this panel asks how the stories we carry today might shape the understanding of future generations\, and the ways they remember\, question\, and imagine. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Indo-Pacific Outlook: An Australian Perspective
DESCRIPTION:As global power dynamics continue to shift\, the Indo-Pacific sits at the heart of a rapidly evolving strategic and economic landscape. In this timely and wide-ranging session\, Peter Varghese\, former Australian Foreign Secretary and High Commissioner to India\, offers a perspective shaped by decades of diplomacy and deep engagement with the region. \nHis address will explore the complex forces redefining the Indo-Pacific: from the sharpening rivalry between the US and China\, to China’s expanding influence and the evolving policy direction in Washington. The session will also examine how key regional players (India\, Japan\, Korea\, Indonesia) are shaping their own responses to these pressures\, and what this means for the broader security of the region. \nAlongside geopolitics\, the conversation will turn to trade tensions\, economic nationalism\, and the slowing pace of globalization; factors that now cast long shadows over our economic future. Can traditional regional institutions hold\, or will more agile\, interest-based minilateral groups take their place? \nFollowing his presentation\, Peter Varghese will converse with Latha Reddy\, Nitin Pai\, and Ranjan Mathai. The evening concludes with an audience Q&A\, inviting reflections on a region that will shape the 21st century. \n

SUMMARY:Music of the Kirana Gharana
DESCRIPTION:A single note can carry centuries of devotion. \nThe Kirana Gharana tradition of Hindustani classical music reveals itself slowly. Like dawn breaking across a silent sky\, it is characterised by a meditative approach. Known for its graceful meend (glides) and evocative sargams (musical phrases)\, this musical evening invites deep listening and quiet awe. \nAcclaimed vocalist Pandit Milind Chittal brings the essence of this lineage to life. With his masterful control and emotive phrasing\, he leads audiences through the delicate unfolding of ragas\, where each swara (note) holds a world of feeling\, and every silence has meaning. \nThis is more than a performance; it’s a conversation across time\, held in melody and breath. \nLet the music find its way to where words cannot reach. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Aah! Aha! Ha-ha!
DESCRIPTION:Are we teaching children what to think\, or how to think? When our children focus on rote learning and exam-based academic progress\, how do we nurture the inventive Indian who can fuel the imagination of the world with creativity\, critical thinking and problem-solving? What if classrooms became labs of imagination\, not factories of repetition? \nThese are the questions that the Agastya International Foundation set out to answer 25 years ago\, by designing a curiosity-driven\, experiential learning model that has transformed education across India. Today\, their vision of sparking curiosity\, nurturing creativity and instilling confidence and caring has impacted over 25 million schoolchildren and 300\,000 teachers in government schools across 23 Indian States. \nAn acclaimed new book from Penguin Random House\, The Moving of Mountains traces Agastya’s extraordinary journey in reshaping the classroom by replacing rote learning with hands-on experiments\, creative projects and interactive models in science\, art and ecology. \nJoin us in a discussion of why this powerful vision for curiosity-driven\, experiential learning is critical to the future of India\, and has caught the imagination of scientists\, industry leaders\, educationists and policy makers alike. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n

SUMMARY:Populisms in India
DESCRIPTION:Populism in India wears many faces; sometimes divisive\, sometimes empowering\, often both at once.  \nIn this event we bring together eminent scholars of Indian democracy and political history. Join Ashutosh Varshney and Mahesh Rangarajan\, moderated by Sudhir Krishnaswamy\, for a critical conversation on the book’s arguments\, and implications\, for how we understand populism\, democracy\, and political modernization in India today. \nThe conversation will centre political scientist Srikrishna Ayyangar’s new book\, A Logic of Populism: India and its States (Cambridge University Press\, 2025). Drawing from diverse state-level case studies\, Ayyangar argues that populists in India operate not merely by claiming to speak for ‘the people’\, but by dividing society in ways that claim to serve a broader common good. Through this lens\, populism is not a singular ideology\, but a political method. One that adapts itself to India’s democratic context in distinct\, often surprising ways. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the discussion. \nTea will be served from 5 PM. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Mosaics of Motion
DESCRIPTION:Like ink on paper\, a dancer on stage brings stories to life through gesture\, rhythm\, and the quiet intensity of perfection. \nIn this specially curated evening\, the National Youth Ballet Company presents a selection of Pas Seuls (solo variations) and ensemble works that celebrate both classic repertoire and fresh interpretation.

SUMMARY:Confessions of a Lobbyist
DESCRIPTION:Insider accounts from political aides\, bureaucrats\, and diplomats have long illuminated the workings of power—but even more enigmatic were the lobbyists. Operating in the shadows\, often invisible to public scrutiny\, they were intimately privy to clandestine negotiations\, back-channel discussions\, and subtle bureaucratic skirmishes. In his new roman-à-clef For No Reason At All\, Ramjee Chandran shines a light on this hidden world. \nChandran—well‑known in Bangalore as a journalist\, publisher\, and podcaster—has\, until now\, remained silent about his time as a lobbyist in 1980s New Delhi\, a pivotal era just before major economic reforms took hold. \nDrawing from real events\, the novel charts the journey of a young lobbyist caught in a high-stakes conflict over silicon metal—a material deemed strategically vital. Central to the drama is Metkem Silicon\, which\, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore\, devoted 17 years to developing indigenous silicon metal technology. Yet their efforts collided with a rival scheme spearheaded by the Department of Electronics\, which wanted to bypass local innovation and import U.S. technology. \nWhat ensued was a four‑year bureaucratic war: media leaks\, secret memorandums\, and the covert involvement of the Soviets and other intelligence agencies—culminating in a final decision placed in the hands of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. \nSet against the backdrop of Cold War Delhi on the cusp of liberalisation\, the novel paints a vivid portrait of a nation—and capital—torn between ideologies and ambitions. The Soviet Union may have vanished\, lobbyists have receded from public corridors\, and few can claim first‑hand knowledge of that era. \nIn Confessions of a Lobbyist\, Siddharth Raja—a lawyer\, historian\, and bibliophile—sits down with Ramjee Chandran to peel back the layers of this story\, offering an insider’s glimpse into a world that feels at once distant and disarmingly relevant. \n

SUMMARY:Code Red: Climate in the Dock
DESCRIPTION:It’s here. The climate crisis is no longer a distant warning.  \nClimate Change: The Policy\, Law\, and Practice is a vital intervention. A book that gathers decades of global negotiations\, Indian legal battles\, and emerging climate jurisprudence into one urgent and accessible narrative. From courtroom precedents to cutting-edge policy\, from carbon markets to constitutional rights\, it examines how law can both shape and respond to the climate emergency. \nAuthor and legal expert Jay Cheema draws from his experience as Amicus Curiae to the Supreme Court of India in a landmark carbon emissions case. Guiding us through the evolving legal architecture of climate action and accountability\, his presentation will be followed by an incisive conversation with an interlocutor to explore the tensions and hopes within the climate discourse. An open Q&A will close the session. \nReshaping landscapes\, displacing lives\, and challenging our very systems of governance\, this crisis can no longer be sidelined. Forests burn where there was once monsoon green\, rivers swell as glaciers retreat\, and the ancient cycle of India’s six ritus feels increasingly unfamiliar. The chaos predicted by climate scientists in the 50’s is increasingly creeping into our reality.  \nBecause the climate crisis is not only legal and political\, but deeply personal. \n

SUMMARY:मुक्ति | Mukti - Liberation in Song
DESCRIPTION:Oftentimes\, the most powerful revolutions begin in verse. \nWith stirring narratives and emotional melodies\, Mukti – Liberation in Song invites audiences to embark on an introspective journey\, guided by the verses of poets who dared to dream beyond boundaries. The programme juxtaposes live performances of classical and folk compositions in multiple languages with immersive narration. Enhanced by a simulcast slideshow that spotlights the rich tapestry of Indian poetry\, this event explores the perennial quest for freedom. \nFrom Tyagaraja’s desire to break free from worldly attachments to Akka Mahadevi’s defiance of patriarchal norms\, each performance encapsulates a unique facet of liberation. Basavanna and Chokkamela’s verses resonate with resistance against caste barriers\, advocating universal equality. Kabir’s timeless words soar with a similar spirit\, calling upon souls to shatter dogmatic chains. \nThis evening\, we honor the enduring spirit of Mukti and celebrate the poets whose voices envisioned a world where freedom isn’t just a political concept\, but a universally human truth. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:River Weaves
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: 11:00 am | Friday\, 15 August\nTimings: 11:00 am – 8:00 pm\nExhibition on show until Wednesday\, 20 August \nWalkthroughs:\nEveryday [Aug 15-20] – 12:00 pm & 5:30 pm \nConversations:\nPanel Discussion – Friday\, 15 August | 11:30 am – 1 pm \nRiver Weaves: Brocades of Banaras is an immersive experience & exhibition that invites visitors into the world of Banarasi handloom\, one of India’s most exquisite and storied textile traditions. Presented by Chandra Jain and designed by Siddhartha Das Studio\, the exhibition is a tribute to the artistry\, symbolism\, and sustainability embedded in every thread of Banaras brocade. \nFrom shimmering motifs inspired by Mughal gardens and temple carvings\, to rare handwoven sarees dyed using natural dyes after a gap of 125 years\, River Weaves presents a textured narrative of tradition and revival. It highlights the unseen processes behind each masterpiece\, degumming\, spinning\, dyeing\, and weaving\, while also centring the voices of the weavers\, many of whom have inherited and protected this craft for generations. \nBut this tradition is withering. Fewer artisans are able to sustain the work\, and the next generation is stepping away. Through this exhibition\, we hope to rekindle awareness and inspire a return to wearing and supporting these textiles\, because unless people continue to buy\, the craft will not survive. \nRiver Weaves is more than a showcase\, it’s a call to action. Every Banarasi brocade is not just fabric\, but a living story of skill\, memory\, and community. \nThe concept and vision for the exhibition were conceived by Chandra Jain\, a long-time advocate of India’s crafts and textiles. As Founder-President of Kadambari and a passionate promoter of Banaras brocade for over two decades\, she has played a pivotal role in reviving and supporting traditional artisans through design\, awareness\, and market development. \nShe has curated and led numerous landmark exhibitions across India\, and her work has been recognized for its impact on sustaining endangered craft traditions. Chandra’s approach combines cultural integrity with contemporary relevance\, making heritage accessible and meaningful to modern audiences. \nThe exhibition has been curated by Chiara Nath and Siddhartha Das of Siddhartha Das Studio\, an award-winning\, multi-disciplinary practice known for its powerful storytelling of India’s cultural heritage. The studio specializes in museums\, interpretation centres\, exhibitions\, and craft installations. Their design brings together historical depth and contemporary relevance\, inviting visitors to engage meaningfully with the legacy of Banaras Brocade. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Piravi | The Birth
DESCRIPTION:103 minutes | Malayalam with English subtitles | 1989 | Shaji N Karun \nOne man waits by the river. Every morning\, every evening. The bus never comes. \nPiravi (The Birth) is a quiet\, devastating meditation on loss\, hope\, and the personal toll of political violence. Based on the life of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier\, Piravi is an intimate elegy for a missing son and a father’s unyielding prayer. With unforgettable performances from Lakshmi Krishnamoorthy and Archana\, the film has earned nearly 30 international awards\, standing as a poignant reminder of how political tragedies are always deeply\, painfully personal. \nInspired by the real-life story of Prof. T.E. Eachara Warrier\, whose son disappeared during India’s Emergency in 1976 while studying at the Regional Engineering College in Calicut\, Piravi is a heartrending portrayal of personal loss and the devastating impact of political oppression. With powerful performances from Lakshmi Krishnamoorthy and Archana\, the film captures the slow unraveling of a family consumed by grief. It has earned nearly 30 international awards\, standing as a poignant reminder of how political tragedies are always deeply\, painfully personal. \nKarun’s directorial debut film will be introduced by filmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini\, who will also moderate the post-screening Q&A. \nNote:\n \nThis special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G. Aravindan and cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun – both of whom we remember with great reverence. BIC aims to pay homage to the iconic duo\, and the Parallel Cinema movement they pioneered\, through the screening of two films bound by their unique\, shared cinematic vision. Read more about the second film in their tribute here. \n

SUMMARY:Acts of Attention
DESCRIPTION:A poet’s prerogative is to witness life. \nSiddhartha Menon’s poetry belongs to a modern practice\, going back to around 1900\, of creating poems through spells of intense attention to non-human life for its own sake. This evening will begin with a conversation between Menon and Prashant Keshavmurthy on how two of Menon’s six poem collections – The Compass Bird (2023) and Lone Pine (2025) – relate to this modern poetic practice. Together\, they’ll trace the lineage of a quiet but radical poetic tradition that resists metaphor\, transcends language\, and pulls attention. \nWhile the natural world has always been a favourite muse of the human mind\, select poets have found powerful anecdotes to draw their readers in. Pushing past the self-centred gaze so familiar to us\, the lyrical observations of this style asks us to witness the fascinating creatures with whom we share this world.  \nClosing with a Q&A open to the audience\, this event promises insights\, inspiration\, and immersion. \n

SUMMARY:Thampu | The Circus Tent
DESCRIPTION:130 minutes | Malayalam with English subtitles | 1978 | G Aravindan \nA circus tent rises by the river\, and with it a world both real and imagined. \nThampu (The Circus Tent) is a luminous blend of documentary and fiction\, capturing the arrival of a travelling circus to a quiet village on the banks of Kerala’s Bharatapuzha river. Featuring real circus performers\, local villagers\, and a cast of non-actors\, the film becomes a portrait of the everyday lives that unfold around a spectacle. \nDirected by G. Aravindan and shot by Shaji N. Karun\, Thampu marked the second collaboration between two of Indian cinema’s most visionary artists. Filmed in stark black and white on a modest budget\, it is a masterclass in restraint and imagination. Every frame holds the weight of directorial decisions: what is showcased\, and what is obscured. \nRecently restored by the Film Heritage Foundation and digitised by the National Film Archive of India\, Thampu has been rediscovered by global audiences. From the Cannes Classics to the British Film Institute’s Treasures segment\, and most recently at the Festival of 3 Continents in Nantes\, its revival is a tribute to Aravindan’s enduring cinematic voice. \nFilmmaker and scholar Dr. Soudhamini will introduce the film and moderate a post-screening Q&A. \nNote:\nThis special screening concludes a two-day tribute to the creative partnership between director G. Aravindan and cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N.

SUMMARY:Kalatra: The Eternal Consort
DESCRIPTION:At the edge of legend and longing\, two women wait for the same god. \nKalatra is a dance-theatre work that reimagines the story of Murugan and his two consorts (Valli and Devanai) not as divine footnotes\, but as women bound by love\, rivalry\, and fate. In the classical Hindu tradition\, Murugan’s union with both is a symbol of completeness\, of sacred balance. But in Sri Lanka’s local poetic lore\, a quieter\, more human story unfolds. \nThe journey begins in Kataragama\, where Murugan is worshipped not just by Hindus\, but by Buddhists\, Muslims\, and indigenous tribes. Each finds a reflection of their own devotion in his form. Here\, the story of Valli takes root\, even as the shrine of Devanai turns away. Locals say she cannot bear to see her lord walk each night to Valli’s side. \nBlending Bharatanatyam and contemporary dance\, Kalatra draws from mythology\, regional poetry\, and imagined memory. Presented by the Keelaka Dance Company\, conceived by Jyotsna Shourie and Aneesha Grover\, with music by Daniel B George\, OS Arun\, and Madstarbase. \nA performance where myth breathes\, and devotion speaks! \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Dual Margam 5
DESCRIPTION:When rhythm takes flight and grace stands still\, something timeless begins to move. \nOn our next evening of Dual Margam\, two powerful classical traditions come together in a rare conversation of contrast and convergence: the soaring\, drum-led dynamism of Pung Cholom from Manipur\, and the grounded\, sculptural elegance of Odissi from Odisha. \nIn Pung Chalom\, dancer becomes percussionist: leaping\, spinning\, and drumming in mid-air with ecstatic energy and astonishing control. Odissi\, by contrast\, unfolds in slow\, sinuous arcs\, where each gesture and every glance evokes poetry\, myth\, and devotion. \nTogether on the same stage\, these two forms offer more than a simple performance. One aerial and athletic\, the other lyrical and meditative; they offer a dialogue. The evening culminates in a collaborative piece where rhythm and grace meet\, echoing shared threads of discipline\, spirit\, and artistic lineage. \nThis event is an invitation to experience the boundless possibilities of classical dance! \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam)\, while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:And\, Salt to Taste
DESCRIPTION:Haven’t we all been to enough discussions where we have felt\, “If only the moderator asked more interesting questions!” Whether it is a book launch\, a post-screening chat with a filmmaker or a panel discussion on issues that matter to us\, the role of the moderator is a critical but often taken-for-granted ingredient. A good moderator has a point of view and – like ‘salt to taste’ in any dish – makes the conversation deep\, engaging and participative. Good moderators build context\, make delicate – sometimes pointed – enquiries\, navigate difficult terrains\, potential conflicts and uncomfortable truths with grace and humour\, all the while maintaining the integrity and forward momentum of the conversation. They also assess the temperature and shifting temperament of the room\, and strive to be the audience’s representative\, in turn challenging and coaxing those they are conversing with. \nIn this interactive workshop participants will explore various tools and techniques that will enable them to learn how to become an effective and critical moderator. Through exercises\, group discussions and feedback\, the workshop will impart practical knowledge on styles and strategies participants can choose from to suit both their personalities as well as the needs of a particular discussion. Finally\, it will also provide tips to build confidence and cope with the last minute butterflies-in-the-stomach that is the worry of anyone who has ever – or never – walked onto a stage! \nIf you are keen on building a safe and inclusive space\, and respectful and inspiring conversations\, if you have an opinion but are interested in engaging with others’\, if you are – or want to be – moderate in truth\, temperate in style and obdurate in quest\, then this workshop is for you. \n
