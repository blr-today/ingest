SUMMARY:Unpacking Economic Freedom in the Constitution
DESCRIPTION:This discussion will explore how the Constitution of India frames the concept of economic freedom. We often think of the constitutional guarantee of freedom in terms of the freedom of speech and expression. This discussion moves beyond this framing to examine the oft-ignored aspect of economic freedom for individuals and organisations. \nThe panellists will discuss the balance between state intervention and individual economic rights\, exploring issues like onerous licensing and compliance requirements for businesses\, property rights and the right to trade occupation\, profession and business. They will also discuss the evolving interpretation of these rights by the judiciary and how constitutional provisions have shaped economic policies and reforms in India over time. \nThis session is the second in the series titled ‘We the People’ to celebrate 75 years of our Constitution. As part of this series\, DAKSH\, in collaboration with BIC\, are organising a series of lectures and panel discussions on various aspects of the Constitution. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Darya
DESCRIPTION:Darya Mosenzon is a pianist and composer specializing in North African music.

SUMMARY:The Forum
DESCRIPTION:In this session of The Forum\, we focus on the critical intersection of gender\, urban spaces\, and security. As cities expand and evolve\, the safety and inclusivity of women within these spaces remain essential concerns. This discussion will center around the challenges women face in navigating urban environments\, whether due to inadequate infrastructure\, social norms\, or policy shortcomings. \nPublic spaces—whether transportation hubs\, parks\, or streets—should be accessible to all\, but many women experience these spaces as fraught with danger or restrictions. In this session\, we aim to dissect these issues while also looking at how socio-economic backgrounds can further shape a woman’s experience of urban life. The role of law enforcement and public policy in addressing gender-based violence is another important focus. Finally\, this session will consider how the ability to move freely and confidently through the city is linked to broader issues of mobility and access. By engaging with these topics\, we hope to generate ideas for creating cities that prioritise safety for all\, especially women. \nThis is the second of our sessions titled\, The Forum\, a series of engaging discussions held at the BIC Library. Our goal is to bring together individuals from all walks of life\, ages 15 to 50\, to discuss topics of importance in a setting that is both informed and informal. Whether you’re passionate about current events\, social issues\, or cultural topics\, The Forum provides a platform for open dialogue and thoughtful exchange of ideas. Inspired by the ancient Roman forums\, where citizens gathered to discuss and debate the issues of the day\, these sessions aim to revive this tradition of community dialogue. \n

Curators Prithi Pais and Anshu Arora have worked closely with director\, Padmini Govind to interpret the complex design briefs of the Babbarra women and add their expertise in ethically sourced fabrics\, natural dye and repeat patterns. \nKarri-djarrk-durrkmirri is an example of the beautiful artwork that can be created when Australia and India work together. Twenty-one unique textiles made from 77 individual woodblocks will be displayed. The woodblock designs were created by Bábbarra Women’s Centre artists over 20 years and reinterpreted into woodblocks by Tharangini Studio artisans. The fabric was produced under curatorial direction of Prithi Pais and Anshu Arora and Jessica Stalenberg in liaison with Bábbarra Women’s Centre. The exhibition also features embroidery by Porgai women artisans and a film by Indian-Australian filmmaker Naina Sen with photographer Anahita Ananth. \nArtists: Deborah Wurrkidj\, Jennifer Wurrkidj (dec)\, Janet Marawarr\, Raylene Bonson\, Susan Marawarr\, Joy Garlbin\, Helen Lanyinwanga (dec)\, Lucy Yarawanga\, Nancy Gununwanga (dec)\, Carol Liyawanga\,  Abigial Gurawiliwili Namundja\, Ruth Bindiedbal\, Susan Marawarr\, Jay Jurrupula Rostron\, Elizabeth Wullunmingu\, Verity Bangarra and dilly bags by Maningrida Arts \nThe exhibition is open to all\, at the BIC Gallery\, from 4th October to 13th October 2024. Artist talks with visiting artists from Australia will be held on Friday\, 4th October and Saturday\, 5th October at 11:30am. \nThis marks Bábbarra’s second exhibition at BIC\, following their successful Jarracharra (Dry Season Winds) tour across India in March 2023\, supported by the Kolkata Consul-General. \nPresented by: \n \nImage credit: Artist Jennifer Wurrkidj (dec) and Janet Marawarr.

SUMMARY:நடபாவாடை | Nadapaavaadai
DESCRIPTION:60 Minutes | Tamil | Suitable for all ages \nThe play “Nadapaavaadai” centers on a woman who is forced to conduct burial rites for her entire village after the passing of her family member\, who previously performed these duties.  \nDue to social inequality and prevailing customs\, women are rarely permitted to even enter the crematorium. The characters in the play question the lady’s access to the crematorium and her role in carrying out those rituals that are traditionally associated with men. \n The charismatic lady performs the rites by taking the center stage\, with only men allowed to visit the crematorium. She leads the burial rites in full face of the public – which many would be reluctant to undertake or would not be allowed to do.   \n“Nadapaavaadai” attempts to initiate an engaging dialogue about her role in diverse social and cultural contexts and its implications. This play has evolved out of a close observation\, followed by an extensive ethnographic fieldwork\, engaging discussions\, and participatory playmaking. \nDirector’s Note \nCredit List \nCast\nManik Subramanian\nArchana Selvaraj\nAbinaya Jothi\nDevi Devadoss\nTamilarasan \nMusicians\nSuren Sekaran\nSathya Sharath \nLight Design: Suthan \nStage Manager: Nethaji \nTechnical Assistant: Raagul \nDesign and Direction: Ramassamy S \nSupported By: The Perch Collective \nSpecial Thanks: Kumari Amma Rajiv Krishnan \nAbout the Velippadai Theatre Movement: \nVelippadai Theatre Movement was founded as a community initiative in 2013 to develop deep connection with the lives\, sufferings and concerns of the self and others as well\, and to inculcate a new awareness in the rural context of Pondicherry about both tradition and modernity. The 15 days Cultural Gathering cum Residential workshop on Theatre-Making and Theatre-Happening titled Cycle Yajna organised by the Movement in 2015 went on to instil a deeper interest for the village people of Kuruvinatham towards theatre while making them realise the rich performance varieties available within their culture and tradition.

SUMMARY:आनंदओवरी | Anandowari
DESCRIPTION:90 Minutes | Hindi (Tukaram abhangs will be sung in Marathi) | Ages 16 years + \nThis play is an adaptation of the seminal Marathi novel ‘Anandowari’ written by D.B. Mokashi in 1974. \nAnandowari (English translation: ‘The Verandah of Bliss’) looks at 17th-century saint poet Tukaram’s story through his younger brother Kanha’s perspective. Tukaram has gone missing again. This time\, though\, the hints seem ominous. We travel through those 3 days of Kanha’s frantic search for Tuka and his many realisations about his brother. \nIn reminiscing about Tukaram\, Kanha tries to grapple with Tuka’s many identities: Tuka his brother\, the son\, the householder\, the creative genius\, a saint\, a reformer\, a rebel. \nThis act of reminiscence becomes an act of grappling with what and who he has lost\, in the process giving us a great psychological insight into the events (personal\, social and political) and impulses that shaped Tukaram’s consciousness and made him who he was: one of the most beloved Bhakti saint poets of Maharashtra\, as tender as he was fierce\, as compassionate as he was unforgivingly harsh\, as much a reformist as he was a transcendentalist. \nOur adaptation focuses on the search that lies at the heart of the text: a devotee in search of God\, a man in search of his brother\, a writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nCredits: \nOriginal Novel Anandowari by D.B Mokashi\nAdaptation and Direction: Gerish Khemani\nHindi Translation: Dr Jaya Dayal\nPerformed by: Varad Salvekar\, Hrishabh Kanti\nBackground Score: Ruturaj Bhosle\nAbhang Composition: Keshav Kudale\nLight Design: Sachin Lele\nLights Operation: Prerana\nPoster and Creatives: Robin Patel \nDirector’s Note: \nWhat interested me personally was the question of the creative consciousness of the saint poet Tukaram\, the source of his poetry\, his metaphysical preoccupations\, his social rebellion\, his love for his beloved God Vitthal. I was interested in finding a device through which I could approach this text. And then it struck me: what would happen if the writer stepped into his own story? His character has found salvation\, what about the writer? How will he? It is an investigation into that search… A devotee in search of God. A man in search of his brother. A writer in search of the poet Tukaram. \nThrough two texts – D. B Mokashi’s original Anandowari and my text where Tuka meets Vithal and Mokashi enters his own story – multiple confrontations are imagined. Confrontation between Mokashi (writer) and Kanha (character)\, confrontation between Tuka (devotee) and Vitthal (God). Creator and creation? One writer (Mokashi) searching for another (Tuka)? And then the question prevails: Who gives meaning to the other? Both depend on each other for meaning. For identity. Can there be a God without a devotee? Can there be a writer without her creation? Each validates the other. And each has the power to cancel each other out. \nBut then what if they exchange roles? Or what if this duality itself is the biggest illusion? And so these two texts came to be juxtaposed\, hoping to interpenetrate and illuminate each other. \nOur adaptation of Anandowari reeks of tremendous longing for the absolute and the madness\, pain of creative consciousness and its concomitant search for meaning embodied in the existential desperation of the protagonists. \nWith Support From \n \n  \n
