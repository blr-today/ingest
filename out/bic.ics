SUMMARY:Swing\, Reverse-Swing\, Knuckle-Ball
DESCRIPTION:Sanjay Mittal’s presentation begins with an intriguing comparison of how air flows around projectiles in various sports\, from the spinning flight of a soccer ball to the subtle aerodynamics of a golf ball. Drawing on data from experiments conducted at IIT Kanpur’s National Wind Tunnel Facility\, he takes the audience on a journey across the fields and courts of sports like baseball\, cricket\, tennis\, volleyball\, and badminton. \nIn professional badminton\, players prefer duck-feather shuttlecocks for their unique feel and flight characteristics. However\, these shuttlecocks are fragile and costly\, so nylon substitutes are common in recreational play. Prof. Mittal will explore how these synthetic shuttlecocks differ aerodynamically from the traditional feathered ones\, illuminating the role of fluid-structure interactions that make them fly—and feel—so differently in the air. \nCricket fans can look forward to a deep dive into the mysteries of swing and reverse swing. Can a new cricket ball actually reverse swing? Prof. Mittal answers this question by presenting results from wind-tunnel experiments and Large Eddy Simulations. He’ll explain why cricketers shine one side of the ball and how the roughness on one hemisphere affects the ball’s trajectory\, enabling “contrast-swing.” With data from carefully conducted experiments on both new and worn balls\, he’ll show how different surface textures create distinct swing behaviors that bowlers use to baffle batters. \nProf. Mittal then shifts focus to the “knuckleball\,” which has gained attention in cricket\, though he notes it’s a bit of a misnomer. Borrowing insights from baseball\, he proposes a model to capture the peculiar movement of a true knuckleball\, dissecting the optimal seam angle\, speed\, and spin rate at release that make this delivery so elusive for batters. \nTo wrap up\, he will delve into the aerodynamics of a frisbee. With every flick and spin\, the frisbee dances on a layer of air\, a perfect example of how the subtle interaction of shape and flow can lead to graceful\, unpredictable motion. \nProf. Mittal’s lecture will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. Mr. Srinath will offer his comments at the end. \nHigh Tea will be served before the event from 10:30am onwards. \nThis lecture is a part of RRI’s Vignyana Kathegalu\, a series of popular talks on science. \nPresented by: Raman Research Institute\, Bangalore \n \n

SUMMARY:Mandala
DESCRIPTION:Mandala\, is a journey through the themes of Shringara (love)\, Viraha (separation)\, Maya (illusion)\, and Aikya (dissolution). It is a dialogue between the dancer and the singer\, using poetry from saint poets of India\, including Kabir\, Annamacharya\, Kshettraya and Kanakadasa. \nA recurring message of all saint-poets across time\, is the reminder that enjoyment\, pain\, delight\, struggle are all fleeting- this too shall pass. They remind us to savour the world\, be fully present in it\, while simultaneously remembering that nothing is permanent. How does one save oneself from the web of Maya- the entrapment of the illusion? The saints offer an answer to this as well. Bhakti- devotion. \nAnd where is the divine in whom we must have faith? In the mosques? In the temples? East? Or West? The divine is within each of us. \nIt is a poetic journey that traces the path from the outer circle of love to separation\, to disillusionment\, to the ultimate realization that we are one at the core. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Prophet of Modernity
DESCRIPTION:Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya (1861–1962) was arguably the most famous Indian engineer of the twentieth century. And yet he was also much more. To this day\, much in India bears the imprint of Visvesvaraya’s work—not only as civil engineer\, but also as public administrator\, constitutional analyst\, and development thinker. His legacies include innovations in irrigation\, multipurpose dams\, piped water supply systems\, technical institutions\, industrial enterprises\, and transformed cityscapes. He was an early proponent of economic planning and rapid\, large-scale industrialization\, which he believed were essential for national development.  \nYet he has remained an enigmatic figure. Despite his legendary status\, little is known about the man\, his strengths and foibles\, the conflicts and negotiations involved in his career. How do we assess his technical achievements against those of his professional contemporaries? What were the intellectual and professional influences that shaped him? In what ways did his background as an engineer mould his conception of economic development? How were his essentially technocratic views received in his lifetime\, and what do we make of them today? \nThese are some of the key questions that Aparajith Ramnath explores in Engineering a Nation. Based on in-depth archival research\, field visits\, and interviews\, the book provides a vivid portrait of Visvesvaraya’s eight-decade-long public career. Throughout\, it highlights the historical context in which he worked. To explore Visvesvaraya’s life\, the book argues\, is to understand the emergence of the Indian nation itself. \nThe author will be in conversation with Dr. Jahnavi Phalkey\, followed by an audience Q&A. \n

SUMMARY:Akhyāt - Ākhyānā 
DESCRIPTION:Words of inspiration from India’s first female teacher…  \nWritings of unabashed desire from the heart of Tamizh land…  \nQuestions of existentialism asked by Buddhist nuns…  \nProse that interrogates anthropocentrism… \nVerses that subvert gender roles and patriarchy…  \n…and more insight into the female perspective of desire\, denouncement\, faith and activism. Only this time\, through poetry authored by women themselves! \nAkhyāt – Ākhyānā is an experiential exploration of rare multilingual poetry tactfully woven into a Bharatanatyam repertoire performed along with live musicians. This work stems from Divya’s diverse encounters with heart-wrenching poetic expressions of women from across timelines and geographies\, in a quest to unearth narratives ‘by’\, ‘for’ and ‘of’ women. \nCast:\nDance | Choreography | Script – Divya Ravi\nMusic composition | Vocals – Sharan Subramanian\nNattuvangam – DV Prasanna Kumar\nMridangam – Srihari Rangaswamy\nFlute – Vivek Krishna \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Tasting Climate Change
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a world with no coffee! Scientists say that by 2050\, your favourite brew could very likely go extinct from changing climate – or at the very least leave you with an unpleasant taste in your cup! \nJoin us for an insightful panel discussion followed by an interactive audiovisual experience through which to discover how climate change could affect the accessibility and flavour of coffee. This session will explore the ecological history of coffee in India\, impacts of coffee production on biodiversity and producer observations of everyday climate change on their farms. The event focuses on the experiences of smallholder producers\, who are often invisibalised in global supply chains\, and whose livelihoods are particularly vulnerable to changing climate. \nOf particular interest is a climate reality – what is the evidence that climate change is occurring in coffee\, how would we experience and indeed taste its impact? To discover this\, participants will be encouraged to sample different coffees as an invitation to taste climate change. \n

Our primary goal is to curate sessions that cater to the diverse interests and ages within our library community. Through this programming we wish for the library to become a dynamic space that goes beyond traditional book-related activities. \nWe also aim to provide a platform for members of the community to sometimes host these events we curate. If you have event ideas that align with our vision\, please reach out to us at collab@bangaloreinternationalcentre.org \n

SUMMARY:Mission Possible
DESCRIPTION:Indian healthcare is at a critical crossroads. \nThere has been significant improvement in the control of morbidity due to communicable diseases. On the other hand\, non-communicable diseases have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Simple community based interventions like sanitation\, clean water supply\, vector eradication and vaccination under nationwide program initiatives helped control communicable diseases. Similar strategies do not exist for non-communicable diseases\, where the prevailing paradigm is the reactive use of expensive curative services. To some extent\, the burden on patients who paid for such services out of pocket has been reduced by increase in capacity and supply of curative services under schemes like Ayushman Bharat. \nHowever\, in a system where providers control the levers of consumption\, for-profit providers are incentivized to artificially stoke consumption until demand once again catches up with supply\, setting up a vicious spiral of inflation in healthcare costs. Scaling up such a supply led healthcare system\, in order to make healthcare universally accessible\, is a recipe for unsustainable increases in healthcare costs. \nThe book Mission Possible takes a hard look at the realities of Indian healthcare and provides a way out of the unsustainable trajectory it finds itself in. Instead of considering the pieces of healthcare in isolation\, it promotes a systemwide analysis of the problems. Based on their analysis\, the authors have not hesitated to propose radical structural changes in the current system\, while providing commentary on why these changes are necessary and how they could be realized. \nA panel discussion with the authors Swami Subramaniam and Aparajithan Srivathsan along with Meena Ganesh (Founder\, Portea)\, Ashok Vellodi (Paediatrician) and Arvind Kasturi (Professor\, Community Health\, St Johns Medical College) will be followed by a Q&A Session. \nTea/ Coffee will be served from 5:30pm onwards. \nIn collaboration with the UHC Dialogues \n \n

SUMMARY:Dharmic Capitalism
DESCRIPTION:Did Rajaraja Chola\, who built the world-renowned Brihadisvara temple in Tanjore\, and Suryavarman II of Kambuja Desa (Cambodia)\, who built the world’s largest temple complex\, Angkor Wat\, erect these enduring marvels with a magic wand? Surely not. How did they nurture prosperity? What were the economic models that enabled them to leave the world awestruck? \nSriram Balasubramanian’s sequel to the pathbreaking Kautilyanomics answers these questions by examining Common Era empires and kingdoms ranging from the Cholas\, Pallavas\, Pandyas and Vijayanagara to Southeast Asian kingdoms. Balasubramanian audaciously puts forward a novel\, indigenous and sustainable framework called Dharmanomics—a function of Kautilyan Dharmic capitalism\, of a Dharmic ecosystem driven by temples and Sreni (corporate guilds) Dharma—that spans thousands of years. It was put into practice much before the likes of Adam Smith and modern economic thinkers. Dharmanomics seeks to present a coherent and structured economic framework based on the idea of Dharma for at least 1500 years. \nIn the session\, Sriram Balasubramanian will share the key aspects from his book. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:The Descriptive Piano
DESCRIPTION:This is a BIC Elsewhere event at Sabha: An Arts and Crafts Shaale \nSince its origins in the 18th century\, the piano has been used by composers to describe places\, events\, and even to conjure up the sounds of other instruments\, from solo violins to full symphony orchestras. In this introduced ‘conversational’ concert\, Karl Lutchmayer will guide his audience through more than a century of piano music\, exploring the endless versatility of the instrument in bringing real and imagined worlds to life. Along the way\, he will play works by some of the most important piano composers\, including Beethoven\, Liszt and Debussy. \n \nThis is a BIC Elsewhere Event \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur\, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations\, arts\, and culture directly to diverse audiences. Through this initiative\, we collaborate with various venues\, extending the reach of our events beyond our own space. These partnerships not only breathe life into our gatherings but also play a crucial role in cultivating an environment for the flourishing of arts and culture in the city. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by:\n   \n
