SUMMARY:Connecting the Generations
DESCRIPTION:Vienna has been an important centre for music for many centuries\, with resident orchestras\, opera companies and musicians of renown. It has also been a meeting place for composers from around Europe who lived and worked there. Marialena Fernandes will perform what she calls ‘Structured Miniatures’ from Vienna’s vibrant musical culture: \nBagatelle – Prelude – Intermezzo – Rhapsody \nEach of these forms brings rich narration into a short\, complex space\, yet they are quite distinct in their characteristics. Among the composers Marialena will play\, some had lived in Vienna and others from far away were influenced by its music. Many of the compositions also happen to be from late in their lives\, in a sense\, their last pieces of wisdom. \nImage Credit\nHeader and Posters: Marialena Fernandes performing at a house concert in Vienna\, across from the Vienna State Opera. \n \nIn collaboration with:\n \nSupported by: \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Nādānt
DESCRIPTION:There is a force of existence\, which can not be contained by space\, or bound by time\, yet it is the one that creates the many dimensions\, patterns and emotions. This is the perpetual dance of existence\, Nādānt\, without a beginning or an end\, and at the very centre is\, Lord Shiva. \nNādānt\, is an exploration by Divya Goswami\, navigating through the leela of the manifest form of the cosmic dancer and the visual discourse on the true purpose of existence; until there is no more. This 80 minute production\, juxtaposes the dyads within Shiva\, who moves like the ripples on the placid countenance\, while bubbling on the surface into a volcanic fury. He reveals and revells in his form\, preparing and inviting the devotee. Slowly\, the seeker understands the secrets to his ominous form\, adorned with serpents\, ash\, fire\, as a mere illusion\, playing out the rhythm of everyday life. \nThe resonating drum\, the rhythmic pneumonics\, the multilayered words\, become a vehicle to find the self\, discarding the fetters\, step by step. Nādānt is the sojourn of a seeker\, as she praises\, admires\, unravels the mystery behind the cosmic dancer only to witness\, partake\, merge into the abstraction of the divine energy. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Africa - The Wild Secrets
DESCRIPTION:Pradeep Rao’s fervent dedication to capturing the essence of wildlife through photography has led him on an extraordinary journey spanning numerous countries\, such as Kenya\, Tanzania\, Botswana\, Namibia\, Uganda\, Rwanda\, Ecuador\, Costa Rica\, Bhutan\, the Philippines\, and beyond. In his quest to document mammals and avifauna in their natural habitats\, he has not only immortalized their beauty but also delved into the rich tapestry of history\, culture\, and indigenous tribes across these diverse landscapes. \nThroughout his travels\, Pradeep has discovered that while wildlife may be ubiquitous\, their ability to adapt to varying terrains and climates in pursuit of sustenance is a captivating phenomenon. Witnessing firsthand the anatomical adaptations these creatures have undergone over time\, as well as observing the grand spectacle of animal behavior\, such as the awe-inspiring Great Migration of Wildebeest\, has left an indelible mark on his perspective. \nThe talk will be followed by a moderated conversation and a Q&A session with the audience. \n
