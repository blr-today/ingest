SUMMARY:Nehru’s India in the World
DESCRIPTION:Scholars of international relations\, political thought\, and India’s diplomatic history continue to debate the meaning and relevance of non-alignment in India’s foreign policy today. The origins of these debates lie in Jawaharlal Nehru’s articulation of non-alignment at the height of the Cold War\, a concept both resolute and ambiguous. \nIn this talk\, Dr. Swapna Kona Nayudu will draw on her acclaimed book\, The Nehru Years: An International History of Indian Non-Alignment (Cambridge University Press UK\, Juggernaut Books India)\, to explore how India’s approach to international affairs and the United Nations now understood in summary as non-alignment. Based on meticulous archival research in multiple languages\, her work uncovers India’s diplomatic and peacekeeping contributions in pivotal global events such as the Korean War\, the Suez Crisis\, the Hungarian Revolution\, and the Congo Crisis. \nTracing the evolution of non-alignment from Nehru’s time to the present\, Dr. Kona Nayudu will examine its contested meaning and its influence on India’s position as the only non-aligned founding member of the UN. \nDr. Kona Nayudu will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Skandaanubhavam - The World of Blissful Consciousness
DESCRIPTION:A poet’s longing\, a saint’s surrender\, and a seeker’s bliss. \nBlending the lyrical storytelling of Harikatha with the expressive grace of Bharatanatyam\, this performance is a humble offering to Lord Muruga.

SUMMARY:Un.Divided Identities
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: 11 am | Wednesday\, 6 Aug\nExhibition Timings: 11 am – 8 pm\nExhibition on show until: 8 pm | Sunday\, 10 Aug \nWalkthroughs:\n4 pm | Saturday\, 9 Aug (followed by a ‘meet the team’ at 5 pm)\n4 pm | Sunday\, 10 Aug \nPartition: Memory\, Responsibility\, and Voice (Panel Discussion): 11 am – 12:30 pm | Saturday\, 9 Aug | Auditorium \nUn.Divided Identities is an interactive choice-based digital exhibition on the 1947 Partition of the Indian subcontinent. Originally launched online in 2022 by ReReeti in partnership with the British Council and Glasgow Life Museums\, this exhibition is now being reimagined as a physical\, immersive experience. It is especially relevant for young people who have only ever encountered Partition through textbook chapters and distorted narratives. \nCurated by ReReeti\, designed by Aditi Dhamija\, and in collaboration with the Bangalore International Centre\, this exhibition urges participants to deeply feel the emotional weight of forced\, mass migration. The digital interactives serve as the core touch point\, but the stories extend beyond the screen. Spilling into the physical space as tactile\, atmospheric\, and visually compelling encounters\, visitors navigate through stories of displacement – stories based on real accounts of families. You will face difficult choices on behalf of characters\, driven by fear\, survival\, and the need to protect their families. \nWhile Partition impacted families across the subcontinent\, its realities are often distant in southern India. This exhibition opens space for reflection and conversation\, prompting visitors to connect personally with questions of identity\, loss\, memory\, and inter-generational resilience. \nThe hope is to change how future generations choose to carry our history forward. \nPlease note: Kids below age 6 will not be allowed inside the Gallery space. \nClick here to know more about the Panel Discussion. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Driving Elephants
DESCRIPTION:26 minutes | English with subtitles | 2019 \nForests inspire awe\, yet fragmentation\, monocultures\, and urban sprawl disrupt their balance\, driving biodiversity loss and human-elephant conflict (HWC). Elephants\, as ecosystem engineers\, adapt by moving through both wild and cultivated lands\, exposing the blurred lines of modern landscapes. \nSet in regions like Bannerghatta\, Cauvery\, and Mysore\, where A Rocha India works closely with communities and frontline staff\, Driving Elephants documents the fatal consequences faced by free-ranging elephants when they venture into human spaces. Male elephants\, in particular\, are increasingly pushed to the fringes\, navigating traffic\, raiding crops at night\, and forming risky coalitions in search of survival. \nWith over 730 humans and 336 elephants dying annually due to HWC\, this crisis demands more than tolerance; it calls for empathy\, equity\, and space for all. The screening of Driving Elephants is an invitation to reflect on coexistence in these shared landscapes and to reimagine a future where people and elephants can thrive together. \nThe screening will be followed by an audience Q&A session with Avinash Krishnan \n

SUMMARY:The Expressive Companion: From Europe to India
DESCRIPTION:Born in Europe and reshaped in Calcutta\, the harmonium arrived in India’s classical music world with baggage: too rigid\, too foreign\, and too limited. Critics called it unfit for the fluidity of Indian ragas. All India Radio banned it for thirty years.  \nAnd yet\, it endured. Its warm\, resonant tones have become the soulful undercurrent to melodious ghazals\, emotional bhajans\, and classical ragas. \nThis evening\, journey through that remarkable evolution with Dr. Ravindra Katoti\, one of India’s leading harmonium maestros\, in conversation with celebrated vocalist Sri Dhananjay Hegde. With Sri Yogesh Bhat on tabla\, they bring alive the stories\, struggles\, and triumphs of this powerful instrument. \nAn evening of sound\, memory\, and musical legacy awaits. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Split Screens
DESCRIPTION:A daring literary experiment\, explored through the eyes of the author herself! \nThis evening authors Meena Kandasamy and Sam Arni will delve into the innovative split-screen structure of Kandasamy’s revolutionary book\, Exquisite Cadavers. Together\, they will discuss how experimentation of form confronts literary expectations\, challenges the marginalization of writers from the Global South\, and connects the intimate landscapes of relationships to broader public histories. \nUnlike a painter’s or potter’s studio where you can watch art come alive\, the writer’s creative process is usually hidden\, mysterious\, almost alchemical. Exquisite Cadavers is Meena Kandasamy’s take on the novel-in-the-margins format. The story of Maya and Karim – lovers navigating the complexities of migration\, racial identity\, and political uncertainty in Brexit-era London – unfold only on half the pages. Juxtaposed with Kandasamy’s candid reflections on her own life experiences\, the book provides a unique view into a writer’s process of creation. \nJoin us for a disarmingly honest conversation on polemics\, protests\, and power. \n

SUMMARY:The Open Couple
DESCRIPTION:Language: English \nWhen the rules of love are rewritten\, what’s left standing? \nDario Fo’s The Open Couple is a bold\, sharp\, and darkly comic exploration of modern relationships pushed to the edge. What begins as a provocative experiment (a husband proposing an open marriage) quickly spirals into chaos\, confrontation\, and unexpected revelations. \nSet against the backdrop of shifting gender roles and social expectations\, the play peels back the layers of a marriage unravelling. With biting wit and disarming vulnerability\, Fo exposes the emotional toll of jealousy\, the absurdity of control\, and the fragile line between freedom and fear. The couple’s battles are fast\, funny\, and painfully familiar\, as they try to navigate the messy terrain of love\, power\, and identity. \nThrough its rapid dialogue and theatrical twists\, The Open Couple holds up a mirror to our ideas of commitment and connection; asking what we’re really seeking when we ask for more. \nA deeply human comedy that leaves room for both laughter and reckoning. \nCredits:\nWriter : Dario Fo\nDirector : Faraz Khan\nCreative Producer : Ragini Roychowdhury\nActors : Vaishali Bisht & Rohan Joshi\nSound : Charvi Ojha \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Sounds from the Library (#4)

SUMMARY:Partition: Memory\, Responsibility & Voice
DESCRIPTION:How do we honour truths without exploitation or erasure? \nThis panel discussion will explore how the chapter of Partition is remembered\, who holds the responsibility of preserving its stories\, and what it means to give them an honest voice. Through literature\, oral testimony\, archives\, or immersive media\, each speaker has engaged with histories marked by silence\, trauma\, and survival. In this session\, they will reflect on the choices they have made: to amplify certain voices\, to tell different stories with care\, and to avoid reducing complex truths into simplified narratives. \nAt the heart of this conversation is a shared responsibility; not only as writers\, educators\, or artists\, but as individuals shaped by inherited memory. As Partition fades from lived memory\, this panel asks how the stories we carry today might shape the understanding of future generations\, and the ways they remember\, question\, and imagine. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Indo-Pacific Outlook: An Australian Perspective
DESCRIPTION:As global power dynamics continue to shift\, the Indo-Pacific sits at the heart of a rapidly evolving strategic and economic landscape. In this timely and wide-ranging session\, Peter Varghese\, former Australian Foreign Secretary and High Commissioner to India\, offers a perspective shaped by decades of diplomacy and deep engagement with the region. \nHis address will explore the complex forces redefining the Indo-Pacific: from the sharpening rivalry between the US and China\, to China’s expanding influence and the evolving policy direction in Washington. The session will also examine how key regional players (India\, Japan\, Korea\, Indonesia) are shaping their own responses to these pressures\, and what this means for the broader security of the region. \nAlongside geopolitics\, the conversation will turn to trade tensions\, economic nationalism\, and the slowing pace of globalization; factors that now cast long shadows over our economic future. Can traditional regional institutions hold\, or will more agile\, interest-based minilateral groups take their place? \nFollowing his presentation\, Peter Varghese will converse with Latha Reddy\, Nitin Pai\, and Ranjan Mathai. The evening concludes with an audience Q&A\, inviting reflections on a region that will shape the 21st century. \n

SUMMARY:Music of the Kirana Gharana
DESCRIPTION:A single note can carry centuries of devotion. \nThe Kirana Gharana tradition of Hindustani classical music reveals itself slowly. Like dawn breaking across a silent sky\, it is characterised by a meditative approach. Known for its graceful meend (glides) and evocative sargams (musical phrases)\, this musical evening invites deep listening and quiet awe. \nAcclaimed vocalist Pandit Milind Chittal brings the essence of this lineage to life. With his masterful control and emotive phrasing\, he leads audiences through the delicate unfolding of ragas\, where each swara (note) holds a world of feeling\, and every silence has meaning. \nThis is more than a performance; it’s a conversation across time\, held in melody and breath. \nLet the music find its way to where words cannot reach. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Aah! Aha! Ha-ha!
DESCRIPTION:Are we teaching children what to think\, or how to think? When our children focus on rote learning and exam-based academic progress\, how do we nurture the inventive Indian who can fuel the imagination of the world with creativity\, critical thinking and problem-solving? What if classrooms became labs of imagination\, not factories of repetition? \nThese are the questions that the Agastya International Foundation set out to answer 25 years ago\, by designing a curiosity-driven\, experiential learning model that has transformed education across India. Today\, their vision of sparking curiosity\, nurturing creativity and instilling confidence and caring has impacted over 25 million schoolchildren and 300\,000 teachers in government schools across 23 Indian States. \nAn acclaimed new book from Penguin Random House\, The Moving of Mountains traces Agastya’s extraordinary journey in reshaping the classroom by replacing rote learning with hands-on experiments\, creative projects and interactive models in science\, art and ecology. \nJoin us in a discussion of why this powerful vision for curiosity-driven\, experiential learning is critical to the future of India\, and has caught the imagination of scientists\, industry leaders\, educationists and policy makers alike. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n

SUMMARY:Populisms in India
DESCRIPTION:Is populism a threat or a corrective to democracy? Can it be both and at the same time? Is there an Indian Way of Populism? \nMuch public commentary on populists has been pulled in different directions\, and it seems almost impossible that we can cohere out of this polarized conundrum and into a shared understanding (even if disagreement) of meanings and labels around this concept. What indeed is the role of Populism in political modernization\, and its place in a democracy\, beyond the Americas and Europe? \nPopulists are often understood in terms of who they are – rather who we think they are. This discussion will centre around a recent book “A Logic of Populism: India and its States” (Cambridge University Press 2025) that tries to understand populists in terms of what they do. Author\, Srikrishna Ayyangar\, argues that what populists do is to divide people\, for the greater common good\, and so who they are depends on political affiliations within the democratic context. Evoking the ‘Indian way’ inspired by A.K Ramanujan’s celebrated essay that the title of this discussion draws from\, Ashutosh Varshney and Mahesh Rangarajan along with Sudhir Krishnaswamy as the moderator will engage in a conversation around the book and the relevance of the theme to India’s democracy.  A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nTea will be served from 5 PM onwards. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Mosaics of Motion
DESCRIPTION:Like ink on paper\, a dancer on stage brings stories to life through gesture\, rhythm\, and the quiet intensity of perfection. \nIn this specially curated evening\, the National Youth Ballet Company presents a selection of Pas Seuls (solo variations) and ensemble works that celebrate both classic repertoire and fresh interpretation. Ballet\, with its rich vocabulary of movement\, is a timeless form of storytelling; one that carries emotion\, history\, and character in every turn and leap. From the mischievous Swanhilda of Coppélia to the grace of the Lilac Fairy from Sleeping Beauty\, the bold spirit of Sylvia\, the charm of the Nutcracker’s Tea Dance\, and a fiery Jazz Waltz\, each piece invites the audience into a world of layered characters and expressive movement. \nThe evening culminates with excerpts from The Cave of Wonders; a preview of Aladdin The Ballet\, the upcoming production by The Lewis Foundation of Classical Ballet. \nThis event is an invitation to witness dedication\, beauty\, and the enduring power of dance. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Confessions of a Lobbyist
DESCRIPTION:Insider accounts from political aides\, bureaucrats\, and diplomats have long illuminated the workings of power—but even more enigmatic were the lobbyists. Operating in the shadows\, often invisible to public scrutiny\, they were intimately privy to clandestine negotiations\, back-channel discussions\, and subtle bureaucratic skirmishes. In his new roman-à-clef For No Reason At All\, Ramjee Chandran shines a light on this hidden world. \nChandran—well‑known in Bangalore as a journalist\, publisher\, and podcaster—has\, until now\, remained silent about his time as a lobbyist in 1980s New Delhi\, a pivotal era just before major economic reforms took hold. \nDrawing from real events\, the novel charts the journey of a young lobbyist caught in a high-stakes conflict over silicon metal—a material deemed strategically vital. Central to the drama is Metkem Silicon\, which\, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore\, devoted 17 years to developing indigenous silicon metal technology. Yet their efforts collided with a rival scheme spearheaded by the Department of Electronics\, which wanted to bypass local innovation and import U.S. technology. \nWhat ensued was a four‑year bureaucratic war: media leaks\, secret memorandums\, and the covert involvement of the Soviets and other intelligence agencies—culminating in a final decision placed in the hands of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. \nSet against the backdrop of Cold War Delhi on the cusp of liberalisation\, the novel paints a vivid portrait of a nation—and capital—torn between ideologies and ambitions. The Soviet Union may have vanished\, lobbyists have receded from public corridors\, and few can claim first‑hand knowledge of that era. \nIn Confessions of a Lobbyist\, Siddharth Raja—a lawyer\, historian\, and bibliophile—sits down with Ramjee Chandran to peel back the layers of this story\, offering an insider’s glimpse into a world that feels at once distant and disarmingly relevant. \n

SUMMARY:Code Red: Climate in the Dock
DESCRIPTION:It’s here. The climate crisis is no longer a distant warning.  \nClimate Change: The Policy\, Law\, and Practice is a vital intervention. A book that gathers decades of global negotiations\, Indian legal battles\, and emerging climate jurisprudence into one urgent and accessible narrative. From courtroom precedents to cutting-edge policy\, from carbon markets to constitutional rights\, it examines how law can both shape and respond to the climate emergency. \nAuthor and legal expert Jay Cheema draws from his experience as Amicus Curiae to the Supreme Court of India in a landmark carbon emissions case. Guiding us through the evolving legal architecture of climate action and accountability\, his presentation will be followed by an incisive conversation with an interlocutor to explore the tensions and hopes within the climate discourse. An open Q&A will close the session. \nReshaping landscapes\, displacing lives\, and challenging our very systems of governance\, this crisis can no longer be sidelined. Forests burn where there was once monsoon green\, rivers swell as glaciers retreat\, and the ancient cycle of India’s six ritus feels increasingly unfamiliar. The chaos predicted by climate scientists in the 50’s is increasingly creeping into our reality.  \nBecause the climate crisis is not only legal and political\, but deeply personal. \n

SUMMARY:मुक्ति | Mukti - Liberation in Song
DESCRIPTION:Oftentimes\, the most powerful revolutions begin in verse. \nWith stirring narratives and emotional melodies\, Mukti – Liberation in Song invites audiences to embark on an introspective journey\, guided by the verses of poets who dared to dream beyond boundaries. The programme juxtaposes live performances of classical and folk compositions in multiple languages with immersive narration. Enhanced by a simulcast slideshow that spotlights the rich tapestry of Indian poetry\, this event explores the perennial quest for freedom. \nFrom Tyagaraja’s desire to break free from worldly attachments to Akka Mahadevi’s defiance of patriarchal norms\, each performance encapsulates a unique facet of liberation. Basavanna and Chokkamela’s verses resonate with resistance against caste barriers\, advocating universal equality. Kabir’s timeless words soar with a similar spirit\, calling upon souls to shatter dogmatic chains. \nThis evening\, we honor the enduring spirit of Mukti and celebrate the poets whose voices envisioned a world where freedom isn’t just a political concept\, but a universally human truth. \nSupported by: \n \n
