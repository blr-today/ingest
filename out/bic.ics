SUMMARY:Leela
DESCRIPTION:Experience an intimate evening of evocative acoustic music with Sanjay Divecha\, one of India’s most celebrated guitarists. Leela is a deeply personal collection of compositions performed on steel and nylon string guitar\, a reflection of Divecha’s artistic journey and spiritual introspection. \nRooted in spontaneity and guided by an unwavering belief in the oneness of all things\, the music of Leela draws from Divecha’s vast experience across genres and geographies. The performance promises not just technical brilliance but an emotional\, meditative space where the guitar becomes a storyteller. \nThis is a rare opportunity to witness the quiet power of acoustic expression from an artist whose work resonates with honesty\, playfulness\, and depth\, much like the divine Leela itself. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Untold Stories of the Indian Rupee
DESCRIPTION:Indian paper money has a rich history\, filled with numerous fascinating stories and unique aspects that reflect the country’s diverse heritage and evolving economy. \nOne of the most remarkable pieces is the only surviving ancient paper note of India\, which was circulated during the British colonial period. Equally significant is the first One Rupee note issued in 1917\, marking the early stages of formal paper currency in the country. Among the rare denominations is the unusual Two and a Half Rupees note\, which stands out for its distinct value and limited circulation. \nThe influence of foreign colonial powers is also evident in the paper money issued by the Portuguese and French in their respective territories in India. Additionally\, several princely states across the subcontinent issued their own forms of paper currency\, showcasing the regional autonomy and diversity of pre-independence India. \nOther intriguing aspects include the issuance of Prisoners of War Camp Money and the use of paper cash coupons as a substitute for currency in certain regions. A rare and noteworthy event in monetary history is the Reserve Bank of India’s simultaneous issuance of currency notes for two different countries—an occurrence seldom seen elsewhere. \nIndia has also seen the release of commemorative banknotes on a single known occasion\, adding a unique dimension to its numismatic record. More recently\, the 2016 demonetisation marked a historic turning point\, acting as a catalyst for increased digital economy awareness and financial literacy across the nation. \nIn this session\, Mr. Rezwan Razack dives into some fascinating anecdotes of Indian paper money. He’ll also be in conversation with Ramjee Chandran about the evolving nature of currency in India. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:EK Janaki Ammal & the Re-Ordering of the Western Ghats
DESCRIPTION:The Western Ghats enjoyed a central place in the life and science of cytogeneticist E. K. Janaki Ammal (1897-1984). To her\, the dense and tall tropical evergreen forests found here was the epitome of climax vegetation in India\, or the mature stage of ecological succession. In order to understand how this balance was reached and stability attained\, she undertook a grand and pioneering project— a study of the relationship between peoples and plants of the region\, both in deep history and the immediate present. One of her chief aims was the making of a modern and decolonialised version of the Hortus Malabaricus— a new compendium of medicinal plants from the Western Ghats\, reordered on the basis of chromosomes\, and containing information on their uses\, as gathered from the forest dwellers\, who she believed were the primary interlocutors of indigenous medico-botanical knowledge. Also\, quite tellingly\, in her advancing years\, rather than expend energy directly wrestling with the Kerala government on the Silent Valley issue\, she championed for its conservation by mobilising international support and creatively embarked on an innovative project— the cytogenetics of the flora of these undisturbed forests. \nThis lecture is part of the Obaid Siddiqi Lectures\, Annual lectures delivered by the Obaid Siddiqi Chair in the History and Culture of Science at the Archives at NCBS. \nImage credit: Thumbnail and Header Art by Megha Ramachandra \nIn collaboration with \n     \n

SUMMARY:What Would Dr. Ambedkar Have Made of the Republic of India Today?
DESCRIPTION:Dr. B. R. Ambedkar is remembered and admired for many things: for his heroic\, lifelong\, campaign to eradicate the evil of untouchability; for his scholarly contributions as an economist and social theorist; for the social movements he led and the political parties he founded; for the educational institutions he nurtured; for his critical role in overseeing and directing the framing of the Constitution; for the brilliant books\, essays and pamphlets that he authored on a variety of subjects. \nThis lecture will focus on Ambedkar as a visionary and deeply insightful theorist of constitutional democracy. By juxtaposing what he said in his speeches in the Constituent Assembly to the social and political realities of contemporary India\, I shall demonstrate how his ideas remain of compelling relevance to us today. While the core of the talk will be on Ambedkar the political theorist\, it will end by briefly comparing his legacy with that of other remarkable Indians of his generation\, such as Nehru\, Gandhi\, Tagore\, and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay. \nThe National Law School of India University\, Bengaluru (NLSIU) and the Ahmadi Foundation have entered into a MoU to set up the Justice Ahmadi Initiative on Rule of Law\, Democracy\, and Social Justice in honour of\, and to preserve and promote the legacy of former Chief Justice of India\, Justice Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi. The Initiative will work to advance the ideas that Justice Ahmadi championed throughout his distinguished career\, including but not restricted to human rights\, education\, inclusion and protection of vulnerable communities\, judicial independence\, alternate dispute resolution mechanisms\, and strengthening of democratic institutions. An annual distinguished lecture series is one of the events planned under the Initiative. Read more about it here. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Deevara Chittara
DESCRIPTION:Presented by CFRIA\, the book Deevara Chittara – The Art\, the People and their Culture – is the first of its kind to archive and document indigenous folk art Chittara and related depleting eco-friendly handicrafts.  \nThe outcome of a two-year intense field work and research\, this book documents Chittara\, its versatility and the local Malenadu culture it is rooted in\, with a special focus on the Deevaru community women who have refined it into an intricate art. It addresses the dearth of resources on Chittara\, essential to keep this living tradition alive. The book informs the reader of the various facets of the art form — its intricacies\, symbolism\, use of natural materials\, the role of women in the art\, its link to social customs like marriages and festivals — of which Chittara is an integral part. The book makes creative use of related folk songs\, proverbs and riddles. It is a valuable and comprehensive resource on one of the most refined folk art practices in our country. \nCFRIA is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and revival of Chittara\, an intricate folk art practiced by the women of the Deevaru community in the Malenadu region of Karnataka. The organisation has spent the last 20 years working closely with artisans from this region to preserve and celebrate this sacred and intricate mural art form.  \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Ehsaas: A Multi-Sensory Journey
DESCRIPTION:Ehsaas is a meditative\, multi-sensory experience that invites audiences to step into a world shaped by sound\, memory\, and emotion. This quiet\, immersive performance centers around narrative fragments\, ambient audio\, and subtle sensory cues that evoke personal and collective histories. \nPresented in an intimate\, contemplative setting\, Ehsaas is not theatre in the conventional sense — it is a space for listening\, sensing\, and remembering. Stories unfold through voice\, texture\, and sonic layering rather than action or spectacle. The work leans into silence as much as it does into sound\, creating room for individual interpretation and emotional resonance. \nRooted in lived experience and artistic experimentation\, Ehsaas invites the audience to witness — and be witnessed — through the intangible yet deeply felt realms of inner life. It offers a rare pause\, a shared breath\, and a gentle return to feeling. \nIn collaboration with:\n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The History of Welfare
DESCRIPTION:Why does welfare feel out of reach for so many\, even as governments promise more than ever? \nWelfare schemes and cash transfers are central to India’s political economy today. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press\, 2025) recounts the crucial history of how welfare has evolved in India over the past century. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day\, the book asks important questions\, illuminates failures and brings clarity to our murky future. \nAuthor Louise Tillin in conversation with Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan\, moderated by Arun Thiruvengadam\, will explore what India’s welfare journey means for citizens\, workers\, and voters today. \nCurious about where your taxes go\, or why support doesn’t always reach those who need it most? Stay for the Q&A and bring your questions. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair\, NLS.  \n

SUMMARY:Dual Margam 4
DESCRIPTION:What happens when two classical dance forms meet on the same stage? \nRooted in tradition\, yet distinct in rhythm and grace\, the fourth evening of Dual Margam brings together two iconic forms: the flowing\, emotive elegance of Mohiniyattam from Kerala\, and the sculptural strength and expressive clarity of Odissi from Odisha. \nEach solo performance offers a glimpse into the soul of its tradition—Mohiniyattam with its gentle\, circular grace; Odissi with its striking lines and powerful storytelling. The evening culminates in a duet\, weaving these two styles into a graceful confluence\, illuminating their shared roots and individual brilliance in a spellbinding visual dialogue. \nWhether you’re a longtime admirer of classical dance or simply curious\, this is a rare chance to experience movement as language\, emotion\, and shared heritage. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam)\, while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Tales of the Night
DESCRIPTION:The solitude of the night-time has always been a space where humans release their innermost thoughts\, whether of comfort\, terror\, liberation\, wistfulness or hope. As such\, many of the finest works of art have been inspired by its thrall. Karl Lutchmayer’s recital discusses and presents some powerful emotional responses to the darkness by a quintet of composer-pianists who represent a pantheon of Romantic and Modernist ethea. From yearning lullabies\, intimate reminiscences\, and nocturnal soundscapes to religious ecstasy\, and gothic horror\, each showcases the extraordinary resources of the piano and the technical and emotional range of the pianist’s art. \n \n  \nImage Credit: \nThumbnail\, Header and Poster: Photos of Karl Lutchmayer by Param Singh \n  \nPresented by the International Music and Arts Society \n \n  \nWith the support of Furtados and Steinway \n       \n \n  \nThe International Music and Arts Society gratefully acknowledges the support of Shashi Uthappa and V Natarajan. \n

SUMMARY:Dvaita | Duality
DESCRIPTION:Contradictions\, comparison and ultimately confluence\, Dvaita | Duality is a fusion of artistic expression and philosophical inquiry. Through two distinct dance forms\, Kuchipudi and Balinese\, the dynamic balance of opposing energies is beautifully displayed. \nCentred around ‘Ardhanareeswara’\, the composite form of Shiva-Shakti\, the dance visualises the distinct yet complementary nature of the masculine and feminine energies.
