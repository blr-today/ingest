SUMMARY:Tat Tvam Asi - Finding Thyself
DESCRIPTION:Tat-Tvam Asi is a meditative dance production that explores the essence of surrender as a path to self-realisation\, through the lives of Andal\, Radha\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu—each a yogi in their own right. Drawing from the Bhagavad Gita\, where Krishna says\, “As all surrender unto Me\, I reward them accordingly\, ” this work reflects the multiple ways one can find the divine: through devotion\, knowledge\, or selfless action. The production unfolds as a series of  vignettes—Andal’s karmic service\, Radha’s longing rooted in bhakti\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s ecstatic sankeertana—interwoven with Krishna ’s own voice as the sutradhar (narrator). From the chariot of Jagannatha in Puri to the quiet sanctum of a temple\, the narrative reveals the beauty of total surrender\, dissolving the ego in divine love. Blending classical dance traditions such as Bharatnatyam and Gaudiya Nritya with original music and poetic texts\, Tat-Tvam Asi is a journey into Krishna Tattvam—the omnipresence of the divine within and around us. \nThe depth of this timeless message and wisdom (familiar to many Vedantic scholars and Indians) was explored by Neha through the many coloured hues of devotion (bhakti) found in ancient lores and cultures. Neha chose the beloved pastoral God Krishna as the focus of bhakti of the devotee. Neha’s approach to Tat Tvam Asi is episodic. Fragments from Andal\, Radha and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were revisited and evoked with compelling conviction through her intense abhinaya. Neha Mondal has conceptualized Tat-Tvam Asi after years of deep reflection on the nature of devotion and surrender. Her creative process involved studying scriptures\, poetry\, and the lives of Andal\, Radha\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to understand their spiritual journeys. She collaborated closely with scholars\, musicians\, and writers to shape a narrative that is both intimate and universal. As a dancer rooted in tradition yet open to exploration\, Neha wove together movement\, music\, and storytelling to evoke the transformative power of bhakti. This production is a culmination of her artistic introspection and spiritual inquiry\, brought to life through dance. \nCredits \nConcept & Choreography: Neha Mondal \nScript: Smt.

SUMMARY:Damaru - Duality
DESCRIPTION:The Damaru\, as an instrument\, manifests the flow of energy between Purusha and Prakriti through its very shape. In it is contained the origin of sound; sound that is the genesis of creation and movement. Conceptualized and choreographed by Vidhya Subramanian\, the work brings together an ensemble of eight dancers – Vidhya Subramanian\, Anu Bhaskararaman\, Anisha Parameswaran\, Archa Shajukumar\, Manasa Vijaychander\, Pranathi Ramadorai\, Sandhya Venkiteshwaram and Subashree S. DAMARU highlights the dualities present within us as well as in the universe—sound and silence\, stillness and movement\, creation and dissolution\, male and female\, self and other\, union and separation – in each of us exists the duality that the universe holds.  \nChoreographed and directed by Vidhya Subramanian\, Damaru is Sparsha Dance Ensemble’s first ensemble work and has received excellent audience feedback. \nSupported by: \n \n
