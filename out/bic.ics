SUMMARY:Quo Vadis Dravidian Politics?
DESCRIPTION:On September 17\, 1949\, C.N. Annadurai (Anna) founded the DMK after splitting with Periyar E.V. Ramaswamy. The party steadily gained mass appeal\, shedding its separatist stance in 1962 and winning power in Tamil Nadu in 1967. Since then\, it has remained a major force\, first under M. Karunanidhi and now under M.K. Stalin. \nDespite political upheavals—including M.G. Ramachandran’s 1972 split\, its 1976 ousting during the Emergency\, dismissal in 1991 over alleged LTTE ties\, and a 1993 split—the DMK has endured\, reclaiming power in 2021. \nKnown for its pioneering welfare policies\, the DMK now promotes its ‘Dravidian Model’ as a national alternative\, emphasizing Tamil cultural nationalism and cooperative federalism. Yet\, 75 years on\, it faces challenges from caste-based and nationalist forces\, as well as accusations of corruption and dynastic rule. \nAt this crucial juncture\, veteran political commentator R. Kannan examines the DMK’s journey and future\, offering an objective and comprehensive account of its role in Tamil Nadu politics. \nAuthor R. Kannan will be in conversation with Author & Editor Karthik Venkatesh. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Mai Ri
DESCRIPTION:Mai Ri beautifully captures the legacy and struggles of two extraordinary women in Indian classical music: Padmabhushan Gaanatapaswini Mogubai Kurdikar and her daughter\, Padmavibhushan Gaanasaraswati Kishori Amonkar. Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar\, an eminent vocalist of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana\, navigated a time when women in music faced societal and institutional barriers. Through sheer dedication and artistic brilliance\, she not only earned her place as one of the most revered figures in classical music but also ensured that her daughter and disciple\, Kishori Amonkar\, became one of the most influential vocalists of her era. \nConceptualized by noted vocalist Radhika Joshi\, who carries forward this lineage as a disciple of Pt. Raghunandan Panshikar (a senior disciple of Kishori Amonkar and student of Mogubai Kurdikar)\, Mai Ri is a thematic presentation that brings alive their musical and personal journeys. Through a carefully curated selection of bandishes composed by Mai (Mogubai Ji) and Kishoritai\, Radhika interweaves music with storytelling\, sharing anecdotes from their lives that offer a rare glimpse into their artistic and emotional worlds. \nRadhika Joshi will be accompanied by Sumith Naik on Tabla and Surya Upadhyay on Harmonium\, enriching the performance with their artistry. \nThis event is part of Unheard Narratives\, BIC’s programmes to commemorate Women’s Day 2025. It celebrates the power of unheard narratives—spotlighting the resilience\, artistry\, and impact of women whose stories have shaped India’s cultural and social fabric. Through performances\, talks\, and films\, we bring these voices to the forefront. \n

SUMMARY:The Sarod Chronicles
DESCRIPTION:The Sarod\, a relatively new introduction in the world of Hindustani classical music has established itself as one of the foremost instruments in this niche artform garnering love from all corners of the world. Originating from the Afghan Rebab\, and demonstrated proficiently and intellectually by the masters of the senia Gwalior and Shahjahanpur gharanas\, the Sarod was later received with open arms by the Maihar Gharana in the late 1800s\, headed by Ustad Alauddin Khan\, and popularised by his son Ustad Ali Akbar Khan as well as Pandit Ravi Shankar. \nThis morning concert features Abhishek Borkar\, a pupil of the Sarod with roots in Maihar Gharana\, through his father Pt. Shekhar Borkar\, himself a disciple of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. The performance will dive deep into the music of Maihar\, as well as present intricate techniques of the Senia and Shahjahanpur gharanas\, beautifully melding into a wholesome and rounded Sarod concert which will present tradition and modernity with just the right balance. \nYou will experience through this session\, the impact and perception of an ancient tradition through a young lens\, as well as the role global music plays in our everyday lives. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Smriti Pravah 2025
DESCRIPTION:When Rukmini Devi Arundale founded Kalakshetra in 1936\, she did not intend to create a new style of Bharatnatyam. Yet\, the Kalakshetra bani emerged—a new approach that distinguished itself from the traditional ‘sadir’ style. Rukmini Devi’s choreography blended classical purity with innovative storytelling\, giving rise to a new school of Bharatanatyam that balanced tradition with modern sensibilities. \nOver two decades ago\, Kalakshetra alumna Swagata Sen Pillai began curating Smriti Pravah in memory of Rukmini Devi\, celebrating her legacy on her birth anniversary and bringing together Kalakshetra students worldwide to honor their guru. After Swagata’s untimely passing due to COVID\, her friends and seniors from Kalakshetra\, Tripti Bhupen and Archita Mehta\, have continued this tradition. \nIn 2025\, on Rukmini Devi’s 121st anniversary\, Archita Mehta’s NrityaSadhana Centre for Bharatanatyam and Indian Folk Dances\, and Tripti Bhupen’s Samarpan School of Performing Arts take a journey into her creative world\, where she preserved Bharatanatyam’s traditions while innovating within its structure. \nThe performance will be in two parts: the first will highlight pieces from the margam choreographed by Rukmini Devi’s direct disciples\, while the second will explore her timeless dance dramas. \nThis year’s performers include Kalakshetra alumni Archita Mehta\, Tripti Bhupen\, Gayatri Krishnaveni Lakshmanan\, Vasundhara Thomas\, Priyashri Rao\, Lasya Priya R\, and Nrithika B Natesh. \nPresented by: \n  \n

SUMMARY:Mirage
DESCRIPTION:\nEverything that we chase in life has ended up as a Mirage\, an elusive state of mind which can never be arrived at. The more we go closer to it the farther it moves. The thin line between reality and illusion blurs our vision\, yet we chase this enigmatic and seductive phenomena called life. Deluded with its charismatic nature\, we are pulled towards the uncharted path. We walk this path of delusion like a musk deer\, who is intoxicated with its own fragrance .It gradually binds us in attachments and emotions which leaves us blinded .We are trapped by her\, whose name is “Maya”. \n\nMirage – A lust for life\, was initially created as a short dance film in 2021 which was screened in a few dance festivals including Inmotion Dance Film Festival\, Chicago .Taking the seed from there\, the work was reimagined for the proscenium stage.\n\nThe performance would be followed by the film screening. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n\n\nDancers & Credits\nSangita Chatterjee ( Artistic Director)\nKavita Das\nLisa Saha\nNabiha Yusuf\nSamadrita Chandra\nPraveen Prasad\nManpreet\n\nMusic – Anirban Bhattacharya\nCostumes – Sandhya Raman\nLight Design – Milind Srivastava\nLight execution – Faruk Ahmed\n\nConcept\, script & choreography – Sangita Chatterjee. \n\n\nSupported by:\n\n
