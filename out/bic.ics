SUMMARY:Project Tiger
DESCRIPTION:2023 | 80 mins | English with subtitles \nLink to the trailer. \nOver half a century ago\, India embarked on a pioneering journey to safeguard its tigers. Since then\, the world has lost two-thirds of its wildlife\, and India’s human population has surged to 1.4 billion. Yet\, India’s tiger population has more than doubled\, and the country is now home to approximately 70% of the world’s last wild tigers. \nHowever\, the path to this extraordinary achievement has been far from straightforward. This film takes you into the backstage of India’s biggest and most ambitious wildlife conservation journey\, narrating some untold stories that formed their legacy. But this is more than just a story of conservation. It’s a tale of hope\, resilience\, and the bond between nature and the Indians. \nThe film showcases how the project has evolved over five decades\, highlighting not only the triumphs but also the setbacks\, controversies\, and compromises made along the way. With an in-depth look at the complexities of tiger conservation\, right from political challenges to poaching pressures\, you will gain a deeper understanding of the immense efforts required to protect this iconic species. The film also sheds light on the steps needed to ensure that tigers continue to roam freely in India’s forests for generations to come. \nThe screening will be followed by a Q&A session with the film’s producer\, Kalyan Varma. \n

SUMMARY:A (Pandemic) World in Syllables
DESCRIPTION:In March 2020\, when the world went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus\, poets and friends Marilyn Hacker and Karthika Nair—living mere miles from each other\, but separated by circumstance\, and spurred by this strange time—began a correspondence in verse. \n‘Renga’\, an ancient Japanese form of collaborative poetry\, is comprised of alternating ‘Tanka’\, beginning with the themes of ‘Toki’ and ‘Toza’: this season\, this session. Here\, from the “plague spring”\, through a year in which seasons are marked by the waxing and waning of the virus\, Hacker and Nair’s Renga charts the “differents and sames” of a now-shared experience. \nTheir poems witness a time of suspension in which some things\, somehow\, press on relentlessly\, in which solidarity persists—even thrives—in the face of a strange new kind of isolation. Between “ten thousand\, yes\, minutes of Bones”\, there’s cancer and chemotherapy and the aches of an ageing body. There is grief for the loss of friends nearby and concern for loved ones in the United States\, Lebanon\, and India. And there is a deep sense of shared humanity\, where we all are “mere atoms of water\, each captained by protons of hydrogen\, hurtling earthward.” \nAt turns poignant and playful\, the seasons and sessions of A Different Distance display the compassionate\, collective wisdom of two women witnessing a singular moment in history. \nKarthika Nair will be in conversation with Prem Panicker. An audience Q&A session will follow. \nPresented by:\n \n

SUMMARY:How We Used to Love
DESCRIPTION:Being immune to the charms of poetry is a crime that is its own punishment\, the Sanskritic tradition tells us. Join us as we discover the allure of Sanskrit and Prakrit love poetry and the travails of translating doe-eyes and elephant-thighs into English with Anusha Rao and Suhas Mahesh\, co-translators of the verse anthology\, How to Love in Sanskrit (HarperCollins 2024). \nHow to Love in Sanskrit is a poetic exploration of the maze of modern dating: flirting\, daydreaming\, yearning\, and breaking up\, through the eyes of Kalidasa\, Bana\, Vidya\, and many other\, often anonymous gifted poets. \nModerated by Radhika Chadha\, the translators will discuss their inspiration for the book\, their approach to translation\, misconceptions about Sanskrit poetry\, and the challenges of translating pre-modern poetry\, drawing from both classic and forgotten texts to paint a picture of what love feels like in Sanskrit. The session will conclude with a reading of their favourite verses from the book. \n

SUMMARY:The Journey of the Veena
DESCRIPTION:Ancient Sanskrit literature mentions the veena as the instrument used to accompany vedic chants\, very much like the organ that was used in the Roman catholic church for the Gregorian chants. The earliest instruments used grass reeds and animal guts as strings for plucking and the joke is that the musicians still use “Grass”. As music developed from folk to classical\, desi and Marg Sangeeth\, as described in ancient texts like Natya Shastra of  Bharata Muni of the 3rd Century AD\, and later Sarangadeva of the 11th Century\, the sophistication of playing techniques has advanced. \nIn today’s musical presentation \, the audience will witness the use of hybrid electronic veenas as a part of this sophistication and progress\, without watering down the gravity and authenticity of the musical form as described in voluminous texts on Indian classical music. \nArtists: \nShanthi Rao and Neeraja Krishnamurthy :Veena\nK.N.Uma Maheshwari :Keyboard\nN.Vasudeva : Mridangam\nSubba Rao : Ghatam \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Making of Modern Karnataka
DESCRIPTION:Karnataka is one of India’s most diverse states\, as rich in literary and cultural traditions as it is in democratic struggles and political churns. The twentieth century witnessed the birth of a modern Kannada renaissance\, accompanied by the emergence of a powerful social conscience. One young man’s desire to explore this vibrant historical backyard\, born out of a feeling of being linguistically unmoored\, compounded by worries over an increasingly opaque political direction\, leads to an ambitious—no\, audacious—attempt to unpack the region’s social and cultural histories. \nRama Bhima Soma is an enterprise of translation and rediscovery\, packed with stories and conversations. The life and times of legends like Kuvempu and Shivaram Karanth; the fall of Socialism and the rise of the Hindu Right; the intellectual ruminations of U.R. Ananthamurthy\, D.R. Nagaraj and M.M. Kalburgi; the wildly popular television serials of T.N. Seetharam and the community-centred one-woman theatre shows of Du Saraswathi; a brief history of Naxalism in Karnataka and glimpses of other complicated legacies of the 1970s’ Left—the book explores a dizzyingly wide sweep of Karnataka’s contemporary history\, seeking\, above all\, to forge new connections and begin fresh conversations. \nMarshalling a diverse range of literary and scholarly resources\, framed through biographical sketches and immersive reportage\, this session will reanimate some pivotal moments in the making of modern Karnataka. \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Out of the Middling Middle
DESCRIPTION:Midlife is a phase when we find ourselves pulled in multiple directions—across work\, home\, health\, friendships\, and hobbies. \nIn this session\, Ravi Venkatesan delves into themes from Deepak Jayaraman’s recent book\, Play to Potential. The book offers a nuanced exploration of how to unlock human potential—not just professionally but holistically—by embracing life’s highs and lows. Drawing from his acclaimed Play to Potential podcast and his experiences as a coach\, Deepak introduces the FLAVOUR framework\, a practical guide to navigating the intricate interplay of family\, aspirations\, values\, and relationships. \nDeepak emphasises that life is a team sport\, with family serving as an essential support system. He argues that personal growth and achievement are deeply intertwined with our family contexts\, a perspective often overlooked in self-help literature\, particularly in cultures where family plays a central role. \nA key insight of the book is the recognition that life unfolds in seasons\, shaped by transitions—some intentional\, others unexpected. Using real-life examples and case studies\, Deepak illustrates how navigating these transitions thoughtfully is vital to realising our potential. \nThis discussion will resonate with anyone in their 30s to 60s\, offering valuable strategies to lead a multi-dimensional\, purposeful life. \n
