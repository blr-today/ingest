Traversing across legends\, architecture\, experiences\, history and more\, Ranga Taranga invites its audiences to embrace the shades of two popular deities: Ranganatha and Panduranga. \nThe program comprised storytelling by Vinay Varanasi and music by Kruthi Vittal\, B K Raghu and B S Prashanth. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Moon on the Man
DESCRIPTION:2021 | 75 mins | English and Hindi | India \nMoon on the Man is an observational and exploratory feature length documentary that questions the most basic assumptions of reality\, perception and choices.

SUMMARY:Gods in the "Clouds"
DESCRIPTION:How do the political aesthetics of the Hindu diaspora in the West interact with mythopolitics in India? \nThis talk studies ways in which Hindu diasporic communities in the West connect with and influence political stories in India. How do these communities use neoliberal digital spaces to enact “long distance nationalism”? And how do artists respond to\, comply with\, and resist the combination of diasporic nationalism and Western neoliberalism? \nBy looking at various forms of cultural expression\, this talk explores the interconnections between Western liberal ideas of diversity and the politics of caste and religion in the Indian diaspora. \n

Contractor’s collection of photographs of Jazz musicians is now with the Smithsonian Museum. This exhibition features a selection from over 20\,000 images taken over 60 years\, many of which have not been previously exhibited. This retrospective reflects Navroze Contractor’s empathetic gaze and his ability to capture the perfect photographic ‘moment’. The curators will be present at the opening. \nCelebrating Navroze Contractor | Auditorium | Friday\, 5 July | 6:30 pm\nThe inauguration and walkthrough of the exhibition will be followed by the Release of the book\, Photography Strictly Prohibited. Tributes by Sanjiv Shah\, Arshia Sattar and Rajesh Nair will be followed by a screening of Jharu Katha (2010)\, a 64-minute documentary film photographed and directed by Navroze Contractor. \nJharu Katha | 64 mins | 2010 | Documentary\nDrawing on extensive fieldwork in remote corners of rural Rajasthan and the by-lanes of Jodhpur city\, this documentary film on the broom\, directed by Navroze Contractor\, engages in conversation with a wide spectrum of broom-makers. Their struggle for livelihood is intersected with different stories of the broom provided by women and ritual attendants of shrines\, traders\, municipal sweepers and garbage collectors. Through the counterpoint of their voices\, the film covers wide ground in opening the contradictory values and belief-systems of the broom. \nSteeped in the realities of caste\, the broom is both a source of livelihood for millions of people and the repository of traditional knowledge. Even so\, it stigmatises entire communities through its associations with pollution and untouchability. Highlighting the humiliation and robust survival of India’s most downtrodden caste groups\, whose hopes are at once catalyzed and complicated by the politics of reservations\, Jharu Katha works towards a larger envisioning of waste in urban India. Bleak and terrifying\, this vision questions the endurance of the broom and its capacity to reinvent itself in a ceaseless process of change \nCamera/ Direction: Navroze Contractor\nResearch/ Script: Rustom Bharucha\nEditor: Monisha Baldawa\nAssociate Director: Madan Meena\nProducer: Yugantar \nदुविधा | Duvidha | 82 mins | 1973 | Hindi with English Subtitles\nBased on a Rajasthani folktale retold by Vijayadan Detha\, Duvidha is about a merchant’s son\, whose relationship with his young bride\, Lachhi is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her\, resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband. \nAt its core\, Duvidha is a metaphysical exploration of love\, desire\, and the complexities of human relationships. The ghost’s obsession with Lachhi and his subsequent impersonation of her husband raise profound questions about identity\, fidelity\, and the nature of love itself. The film invites the viewer to ponder the depths of human longing and the lengths to which one might go to satisfy that longing. \n

Our vibrant community of film aficionados will collectively rediscover Indian cinema’s most stunning and enduring masterpieces. \nSo join us on this quest to experience the films that have defined and redefined the art form. Don’t miss out on crossing these essential works off your bucket list. Because to truly live\, you must first watch the films that make life worth living. \nThis month’s film featured in our informal film club is Duvidha (1973) \nDuvidha is a hauntingly beautiful and thought-provoking film that delves into the realms of folklore\, desire\, and the complexities of human relationships. Based on a Rajasthani folktale\, the film weaves a captivating tale of a young bride\, Lachhi\, whose newfound marriage is immediately put to the test by circumstances beyond her control. \nOn the very day of their wedding\, Lachhi’s husband\, a merchant’s son\, departs on a five-year business trip\, leaving her behind in the care of his family. Amidst this lonely existence\, a mischievous and longing ghost\, enchanted by Lachhi’s beauty\, devises a cunning plan to impersonate her husband and gain her affection. \nDirector Mani Kaul’s masterful storytelling and Navroze Contractor’s exceptional cinematography breathe life into this enigmatic narrative\, creating a hypnotic and surreal atmosphere that blurs the boundaries between the corporeal and the ethereal. The film’s striking visuals\, infused with rich textures and rhythmic sequences\, transport the viewer into the vibrant tapestry of Rajasthani culture\, where the rhythms of daily life intertwine with the spectral realm. \nAt its core\, Duvidha is a metaphysical exploration of love\, desire\, and the complexities of human relationships. The ghost’s obsession with Lachhi and his subsequent impersonation of her husband raise profound questions about identity\, fidelity\, and the nature of love itself. The film invites the viewer to ponder the depths of human longing and the lengths to which one might go to satisfy that longing. \nBeyond its captivating narrative\, Duvidha also serves as a powerful commentary on societal norms and gender dynamics. Lachhi’s predicament\, torn between her duty as a wife and the allure of the supernatural\, reflects the constraints and expectations placed upon women in traditional societies. The film subtly challenges these conventions\, inviting the viewer to question the foundations upon which societal structures are built. \nUltimately\, Duvidha is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends its folktale origins\, offering a transcendent and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition. With its mesmerizing visuals\, haunting narrative\, and profound themes\, the film continues to resonate with audiences\, inviting them to embark on a journey that blends the fantastical with the deeply human. \n

SUMMARY:ಅಮ್ಮ ಮತ್ತು ಸುಹೇಲ್ | Amma Mattu Suhail
DESCRIPTION:Kannada | 90 minutes | Suitable for Ages 16+  \nThe play is an ode to queer love. It is a meditation on the values of empathy and dialogue as powerful agents to bring estranged minds together. The narrative traverses through moments of passion\, anger\, sadness\, and love in its raw human element. The characters attempt to interrogate\, understand\, and acknowledge each other\, and in this process\, unveil the universality of all emotions as being the same\, irrespective of gender and orientation. The play tries to deconstruct and lay open the psychological and emotional baggage of the characters who are but symbols of the divided humanity that we are today. An interfaith gay couple and the mother of one of the characters venture on a journey of understanding one another rather light-heartedly through uncomfortable conversations\, only to explore depths which they never knew or imagined would be possible to unearth. \n\n\n\n\nPlaywright/Director’s Note: \nWith the drastic change in the political discourse the world has witnessed in the last few years\, one cannot but notice the drastic emergence of an undeniable divide within humanity. There are two segments that appear to be in stark contrast\, constantly struggling and fighting with each other. There is a constant othering and exclusion of minorities by the majority in power. During the pandemic\, the apathy by the political class at large was glaringly visible and we witnessed in full display the class disparity that envelops our nation. The Hindu – Muslim rhetoric was constantly fed to us through public discourse and hate was offered as a staple diet for even those who refused to be part of it. \nThe artist felt compelled to speak up\, believing that love is the only antidote to the vehement poison of hate. They hence decided to write and direct this play that features the love story of a gay couple hailing from the Hindu and Muslim communities. Diversity cannot be celebrated without the intersectionality that makes for the complex mix of the society we are. The play intends to hold the mirror to the microaggressions and biases that consume us all through humor and emotional storytelling. \nWith music\, love\, and humor\, the play tries to unravel the demons of Islamophobia and homophobia in us all. It celebrates the value of empathetic dialogue and honest communication in eradicating hate. Amma mattu Suhail is a tender story of love\, acceptance\, and possibilities. \nThe artist is a classical musician\, writer\, and theatre practitioner\, and their arts practice is always an amalgamation of these elements. They create out of necessity! Having grown up queer and gender fluid\, they struggled to find representation in the Kannada arts scene and were disappointed. They tried to fit in and adapt to the arts “as is” but eventually found it suffocating and had to carve out their own path and create what they wanted to engage with. They strive to bring marginalized voices to the fore and their stories or creations always aim to question and break patriarchal stereotypes and conditioning. Their search is always to find fluidity. Just like their characters either in the plays they have written or in the dance-based compositions they have created\, which always traverse through the non-binary nature of gender identity or sexuality\, the art they create yearns to find fluidity in form and content. They break the structure and form using non-linear narratives\, democratic – secular emotional indulgences\, and fluid emotional paradigms. They attempt to convey the grotesque bizarreness of our social existence with humor and the humorous\, funny realities that define us through the macabre. \nThey always like to begin with an uncomfortable space and establish familiarity with the unfamiliar. Most importantly\, they want their art to be accessible to all class and caste sections of society. They often find it very difficult to mold their form in a way that does not “other” an audience which has no access to learning arts appreciation or delving into abstraction. While they try to abstain from dumbing down their audience\, they make it a priority to make their arts inclusive. Having been in circles where art is created and consumed in the same vicious elitist spaces and circles\, they yearn to connect to a larger canvas. \nHaving written\, produced\, and directed three plays\, their exploration has always yearned to find that fluidity between sound and silence\, prose and poetry\, body and realism. They aim to tell more queer stories which are embraced by the mainstream and more mainstream stories which make the queer community feel that they are “seen”. Whilst they are cognizant of the brutal grays that marginalized voices live in\, they believe we need more positive representation of these marginalized characters. Their younger queer self wanted to watch happy endings and stories of hope and not just suicide and tragedies. They work only on stories which are fictional retellings of lived experiences and also for these stories to be specifically told in Kannada. Regional languages have the power to automatically place these stories in a certain space while also making sure to remove them from only English-speaking elite spaces. They strive to create work which opens itself to a more vulnerable audience who need to hear\, get uncomfortable\, and feel ignited towards a spirit of inquiry through these stories. \nThey will be glad if their art is also entertaining but they will never be okay if it is not activism. \nCredits: \nPlaywright – Direction – Music : Karthik Hebbar\nCast: Dr Seetha Kote\, B V Shrunga\, Arun D T\nLighting: M G Naveen\nProduction Manager: Murali Sreeram\nSubtitles Execution: Chethana Ramesh Srivatsa\nBackstage: Vishak Bharadwaj and Soumya Dixit\nProduced by Dheemahi Theatre \nDheemahi Theatre was born out of the need to create a safe space for new voices. We are a space for the “outsiders”. We have come together to tell stories that have been oppressed and suppressed in other majoritarian spaces. Empathy and humanity are the main focuses of all the work that we create. We as a team thrive on celebrating diversity and secular narratives by exploring and devising new techniques for facilitating these stories. We work around minimalist production setups and maximal internal processes. With a passion for storytelling that transcends boundaries\, we strive to create a stage that reflects the kaleidoscope of human experiences. Our productions are more than performances; they are a canvas of shared narratives that resonate with the richness of our collective journey. We aspire to weave together tales that inspire\, provoke thought\, and unite us in the magic of the theatre. \nSupported by: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n

SUMMARY:Secularism\, Religion and Women
DESCRIPTION:This panel discussion is a conversation between two authors who also share a teacher-student relationship. Nivedita Menon will speak on her latest book\, Secularism as Misdirection\, while Debangana Chatterjee\, her student from Jawaharlal Nehru University\, will present her first book\, Lives of Circumcised and Veiled Women. The intellectual pursuits of two individuals\, which converged in classroom discussions once\, complete a full circle of knowledge creation. \nThe conversation aims to probe religion and secularism using gender as the focal point. Menon’s title alludes to perspectives from the global South and India. In her argument\, secularism performs a “misdirection” as in the performance of a magic trick. It simultaneously hypervisiblises women and religion and obscures caste\, capitalism\, and the non-individuated\, non-rational self.  Chatterjee’s work sheds light on the politics of representation and the process of exoticising women’s bodies in knowledge production; presenting the politics which cloaks the ‘misdirection’. It brings out the intricacies of representational discourses around cultural practices of female circumcision and Islamic veiling. \nThe conversation will be moderated by Rinku Lamba\, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Longen Folk to Go on Pilgrimage
DESCRIPTION:2022 | 88 mins | English | India \nThe film is about what used to be a little-known event until the 1980s but which has now become the single largest annual pilgrimage in India: The Kanwar Yatra. \nThe Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage dedicated to Lord Shiva in which devotees\, known as kanwariyas\, fill water from the river Ganga and carry it back to their hometowns for liberations. \nThe film looks at not just the religious and cultural aspects of the Yatra but also its socio-economic impact\, the environmental issues attached to it (for instance\, the state of the Ganga)\, the sheer maleness of the event\, and how the occasion is being used by Hindu right-wing groups to push their majoritarian agenda and the showcase it has become for Hindu nationalism. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with Director\, Kunal Vohra. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n
