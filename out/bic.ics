Are we moving towards a multi-polar world\, in which there will be another 8-10 countries that are also key players? Are we going to live with a fluid situation and a de facto continuation of Pax Americana? \nIn this episode of BIC Talks\, Deepak Nayyar will deliver a talk .This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in March 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere\, including Apple Podcasts\, Spotify\, Google Podcasts\, Castbox\, Overcast\, Audible\, and Amazon Music. \n

SUMMARY:Sitar for Soul
DESCRIPTION:The traditional form of sitar performance is the solo sitar recital\, typically accompanied by the tabla. In this setting\, the sitar is used to explore and express the depth of North Indian classical ragas\, while the tabla provides rhythmic support\, showcasing the intricate patterns and cycles that are fundamental to the music. \nOne of the most distinguished styles of sitar playing is the Jafferkhani Baaj\, innovated by Padma Bhushan Ustad Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan. This style is known for its bold\, structured\, and rhythmically dynamic approach\, combining the precision of been-baaj. Jafferkhani Baaj emphasizes powerful right-hand techniques\, intricate rhythmic phrasing\, and clear melodic articulation\, offering a unique balance of melody and rhythm that makes it both intellectually profound and aesthetically captivating. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Save the Drama
DESCRIPTION:The experience of theatre is dynamic; plays are meant to be read and heard as much as they are performed and imbibed. \nCome\, participate in the BIC’s dramatised reading of Mahesh Dattani’s On a Muggy Night in Mumbai. \nOn a Muggy Night in Mumbai is the first contemporary Indian play to openly tackle gay themes of love\, partnership\, trust and betrayal. Kamlesh—young\, gay and clinically depressed—invites his friends home ostensibly for an evening of camaraderie. However\, with the arrival of his sister and her fiancé\, a series of dramatic confrontations is set into motion\, leading to startling revelations and unexpected catharsis. \nThis session will be structured as a cold and dramatic group reading carried by participants and facilitated by Samragni Dasgupta and the BIC team. \nPlease note: This is an interactive participatory event designed for a small group of people. Please RSVP only if you can make it to the event and make sure to bring along a device you can comfortably read the play on! \n

SUMMARY:Signs From the Sky
DESCRIPTION:\nThe session builds on Asko Parpola & Iravatham Mahadevan’s extensive works to show that a substantial portion of the IVC seals was a Celestial Omens List with the planet Venus occupying a central role in their astronomy. The study presents the full decipherment of 75 inscriptions and a partial decipherment of 61 inscriptions forming approximately 5% of the total number of inscriptions. \n\n\n\nKey findings demonstrate the exceptional astronomical sophistication of the Harappan civilization\, including: (1) proof that bilingual parallels can effectively decipher the IVC script; (2) evidence that Harappan astronomical knowledge predated Babylonian astronomy by centuries; (3) the first complete decipherment of the Swastika symbol\, revealing its astronomical significance; (4) identification of signs for planetary movements\, conjunctions\, and their associated omens; (5) discovery of Harappan meteorological methods using Venusian astronomy; and (6) a new understanding of the Great Bath Complex as a venue for astronomical rituals. \n\n\nThis work represents a significant breakthrough in understanding the intellectual and religious life of one of the world’s earliest urban civilizations\, revealing their deep engagement with astronomical observation and its application to social and religious practices. Through archaeoastronomical analysis\, the paper reconstructs the probable actual dates of celestial events tracked by the Harappans\, providing empirical validation for the proposed decipherments.\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience.\n\n

SUMMARY:Mānushī – On a Quest
DESCRIPTION:Mānushī – On a Quest traces the spiritual and emotional journeys of four extraordinary women: the elusive River Saraswathi\, the devoted Meerabai\, the yearning mother Devaki\, and the mystic poet Akka Mahadevi. Rooted in literature\, poetry\, and deep personal exploration\, this Bharatanatyam solo presentation is the culmination of over two years of immersive research and creative engagement. \nThe performance opens with the mystical tale of Saraswathi\, inspired by the book The Lost River\, exploring whether the river still flows—physically and spiritually. We then journey with Meerabai\, who seeks her beloved Krishna through soulful bhajans marked by longing\, devotion\, and unanswered questions. Devaki’s poignant voice follows\, reflecting on the joys of motherhood she never fully experienced and her yearning to reclaim lost moments with her son\, Krishna. The production concludes with Akka Mahadevi\, whose powerful Vachanas guide us on a quest for liberation\, echoing the eternal human desire for union and truth. \nEach piece is supported by evocative compositions\, guided by literary scholars\, and brought to life through thoughtful choreography. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Uniformity or Justice?
DESCRIPTION:The Uniform Civil Code (UCC) has long been at the heart of India’s constitutional and cultural tensions — hailed by some as a promise of equality\, and critiqued by others as a tool of homogenisation. As the political momentum around the UCC gathers pace once again\, with the recent Uttarakhand legislation in the news\, this session revisits the debate from a constitutional\, feminist\, and social justice lens. \nWhat does “uniformity” mean in a deeply plural society? Can equality be achieved without erasing difference? How do we center the lived realities of women\, religious minorities\, Dalits\, and Adivasis in this conversation? \nA moderated discussion with the panelists will be followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Bag Dancing
DESCRIPTION:Bag Dancing\, written by Mike Kenny\, one of England’s foremost playwrights for young audiences\, is directed by Ujwala Rao and produced by Butai. The cast features acclaimed Kannada and English theatre artists B V Shrunga and Surabhi J Herur. \nThe play poignantly follows Imelda\, a homeless woman who carries her life’s memories and stories in bags. Neville\, a young worker at a homeless shelter\, guards his emotions\, burdened by his own past. As their unexpected friendship blossoms\, they begin to share their stories\, creating a meaningful bond between them. \nDirector’s Note: \nBag Dancing is a play that has drawn me in repeatedly. What continues to captivate me is how playwright Mike Kenny thoughtfully and playfully explores powerful themes such as war\, displacement\, and the intersection of mental health and authority—particularly through a lens that resonates with children and young audiences. \nDuring the creative process\, I’ve found the exploration of boxes and borders especially intriguing—who defines them\, who decides their importance\, and how we navigate the spaces they limit. \nThis play presents a unique opportunity for families and schools to engage in meaningful conversations with children\, sparking discussions about complex topics that might otherwise seem too difficult or uncomfortable to address. \nI hope Bag Dancing fosters reflection\, curiosity\, and open dialogue. \nCredits: \nProduction Assistant: Rachana R\nChoreography: Asha Basavaraj \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Equus
DESCRIPTION:Equus derived from the Latin word for ‘Horse’ is a psychological drama that delves deep into the mind’s primal corners. Written in 1973\, the English “whydunit”\, inspired by a real-life incident\, unravels the mystery behind a shocking act of violence; “Seventeen-year-old\, Alan Strang\, blinds four horses with a metal spike\, in a single night”. \nThe story follows Martin Dysart\, a child psychiatrist\, who begins treating Alan\, only to find himself grappling with his inner turmoil. As the investigation unfolds\, Dysart brings to light\, Alan’s religious\, emotional\, and sexual obsession for horses\, which leads him to confront unsettling truths about the nature of normalcy\, worship\, and desire. Consumed by envy of Alan’s raw\, unfiltered passion\, he is forced to confront the suffocating monotony of his own life. \nPlayhouse re-imagines the classic through Jung’s lens of ‘Shadow Self’\, and makes use of the evocative power of shadow theatre to throw light on the darkness that remains hidden. Alan’s intense passion and obsession with horses becomes a powerful metaphor for humanity’s most profound extremes—what we suppress\, what we idolize\, and what ultimately defines our very existence. \nCrafted by Peter Shaffer \nSupported by: \n \n
