SUMMARY:Abu’s World
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: Friday\, 23 August 6:30 pm\nTimings: 10 am to 8 pm\nExhibition on show until Monday\, 26 August \nWalkthroughs with the Curator:\nFriday 23 August\, 6:45 pm\nSaturday\, 24 August\, 11:30 am and 6:00 pm\nSunday\, 25 August\, 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm\nMonday\, 26 August\, 6:30 pm \nPanel Discussion: Sunday\, 25 August\, 11:00 am \nIt has been almost 22 years since Abu Abraham’s acerbic pen was laid to rest in his home state of Kerala. But the magnificent oeuvre of this renowned Thiruvalla-born cartoonist\, artist\, journalist\, and author will endure.  \nIn his nearly six-decade career\, from the late 1940s to the early 2000s\, with some of the leading publications in India and England\, Abu captured the zeitgeist of those turbulent times in his prodigious output that comprised political cartoons\, illustrations for newspaper columns\, caricatures\, comic strips\, impressionist sketches\, travel drawings\, portraits\, and even an animation film titled No Arks. \nOn display are cartoons\, sketches\, and notebooks\, including some that have never been seen in public before. These works also chronicle his extensive travels all over the world\, his presence at momentous events\, and his meetings with the famous personalities of those times. Abu’s career peaked in the 1970s after he returned to India from England. From his vantage point in the national capital\, he was able to dissect major events like the Bangladesh War and the Emergency with his biting wit that never shied away from speaking truth to power. Not surprisingly\, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\, who was at the centre of most political developments\, figured prominently in his cartoons\, as did the national and regional leaders who were in opposition to her\, including those from her own party. \nThis centenary exhibition provides a glimpse into Abu’s large body of work\, evoking his versatility as an artist and the spirit with which he lived his life. True to the ethos of political satire\, he does not spare anyone! The exhibition has travelled to Kochi and Kolkata and will go to New Delhi after this show in Bangalore. Don’t miss it! \nOn Sunday\, August 25\, 2024 at 11 am\, as part of the exhibition “Abu’s World\,” there will be a panel discussion featuring cartoonists\, journalists\, and a historian. They will explore the impact and significance of Abu Abraham’s work in their respective fields and its relevance in contemporary times. \nThis exhibition was supported by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi. \n(Text courtesy: Ayisha and Janaki Abraham\, Mario Rodriguez\, Siddharth Shivakumar\, Prateeti Punja Ballal) \n

SUMMARY:सिल्वटें | Silvatein
DESCRIPTION:90 minutes | Hindi | Suitable for 16 years+\n\nOn a day unknown\, at a place not known\, two people run into one another. They soon start talking to each other\, but they seem to be conversing at cross purposes. They seem to be long-lost lovers but\, at the same time\, seem to be perfect strangers. They seem to have had a life together but\, at the same time\, seem to have had lives apart. They seem to occupy differing realities but simultaneously seem to be in someone’s dream. Who are they? Where are they? Are they actually strangers? Or do they indeed know each other? Is this even real?\nOr is it only someone’s imagination? \nDirector’s Note:  \nThe experience of writing this play\, and now producing and directing it for the stage\, have been cathartic and instrumental in helping me emerge from a difficult year. I am now eager to see how audiences respond to this attempt by our merry band of artists to tell a story from all our lives. I am absolutely swept with the power of community as I see how the cast and crew has worked relentlessly to bring Silvatein on stage\, amidst laughter\, excitement and pure joy of working together. It is a prime example of the passion\, honesty and commitment that brings forward a story about two individuals caught in a web of lies or deceit or it something completely imaginative. This play is intensely special to me\, not only because I have written and directed it but also because the themes and characters are inspired from real life and real incidents that will provoke the audience to reflect on their own experiences. Silvatein is a piece of writing that managed to paint a picture of a world of intimate details that devastates Rupali and Arijit and somehow manages to be bite sized. The characters are delightfully complex and multifaceted and the story feels comfortingly familiar. \nCredit List: \nSet Design: Puneet Gupta and Prachi Kalra\nLight Design: Srinivas Beesetty\,\nPoster Design: Sweta Garg\nProduction Manager: Archana Kariappa and Sandeep Jain\nWritten and Directed by: Shatarupa Bhattacharyya\nCast: Ujani Ghosh and Sagnik Sinha \nSupported by \n \n

SUMMARY:Rhythms of the Desert
DESCRIPTION:Langa and Manganiyar musicians of Rajasthan are a hereditary community of professional musicians from the villages of Barmer\, Balotra\, Jodhpur\, Phalodi and Jaisalmer in the desert areas of western Rajasthan. They have a vast repertoire of folk music integral to their way of life and social systems. Their music\, which has been preserved and passed down through generations\, acts as a medium of information and storytelling\, much like the postcards in your exhibition. \nThe Manganiars’ music has survived for decades thanks to the traditional Jajmani (patronage) system\, which supports their art form and livelihood. Their music has continued to survive for decades mainly because of the Jajmani (patronage) system\, which is fundamental to their art form as well as the source of traditional livelihood. These traditional patrons have been supporting the economy of the communities of Langa and Manganiyar musicians for generations. \nAn eight-member team led by Sardar Khan Langa & Sawai Khan Manganiyar will present traditional folk music of Rajasthan along with Kalbeliya song & dance. Sardar Khan is a senior Langa guru\, a very knowledgeable person of Barnawa Jageer\, and has traveled worldwide to present traditional folk music. Sawai is a young Khartal player of Barna Jaisalmer who has collaborated with various world music maestros. The other members of the team consist of Deu Khan in vocals\, Sikander Khan in Sindhi Sarangi & Algoza\, and Goram Khan in Dholak. This music group will be accompanied by a three-member Kalbelia team including two dancers and one musician. \nIn collaboration with: \n      \n

SUMMARY:Inside India’s Red Corridor
DESCRIPTION:The Red Corridor remains one of the most complex and challenging areas in India\, marred by Naxal-State conflict\, that has been shaping the lives of its residents for over half a century. In the years of reporting from the conflict zone of Bastar\, journalist Ashutosh Bhardwaj pieced together The Death Script: Dreams and Delusions in Naxal Country. \nIn this session\, Ashutosh will shed light on his experience in the conflict zone – reporting on the Maoist\, the state atrocities\, the plight of the Adivasis caught in the civil war and what it means to live through and write about these experiences as a journalist and a bilingual writer. He will talk about deviating from the traditional form of journalistic writing into more creative ones and the crossroads where these forms converge and diverge. The talk will also offer insights into the status of the Hindi media\, its role in shaping the Hindi belt polity\, and the urgent need to focus on and invest in this media section. \nAshutosh Bhardwaj will be in conversation with Kannada author Vasudhendra followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Musical Ecologies
DESCRIPTION:What is nature? Though it is a term used so ubiquitously\, its meaning has been debated and questioned\, changing with each era. While trees\, animals and the planets are considered natural elements\, it is the human relationship to nature that concerns us the most. Aren’t humans too part of nature\, rather than external to it? What is the relationship between humans and nature? Is it merely utilitarian\, or is there hope that can it be something more? \nMusical Ecologies is an exploration of how music and art can answer such questions for us\, by showing us how to experience nature as a world of emotion. Hindustani music has a long tradition of celebrating natural beauty and seasons. These compositions capture the subjective human response to nature\, locating humans very much inside the natural ecosystem as co-habitants. Perhaps by relating to nature on its own terms rather than from a position of control or exploitation\, we can contemplate a symbiotic model of living for the future. \nHindustani vocalist Priya Purushothaman presents bandishes and raags that celebrate the environment and its rich ecosystems\, interspersed with commentary addressing these philosophical questions\, suggesting a way of bringing together environmental consciousness and music. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n     \n  \n

SUMMARY:Tango Ports
DESCRIPTION:Puertos de Tango (Tango Ports) aims to revisit lesser-known themes of great Uruguayan authors\, thus keeping wonderful compositions alive. The project includes a special tribute to Astor Piazzolla and the great Uruguayan poet Horacio Ferrer\, evoking much of their creative duo and reinterpreting part of their repertoire inspired by the artists’ homeland\, Uruguay. In this kind of cosmopolitan tango without temporal and spatial boundaries\, some versions in Italian and French are included\, justified in the words of Ramón Pelinski (Argentine ethnomusicologist and composer) who describes tango as a “global metaphor”: a tango with infinite possibilities\, capable of imagining and travelling to other worlds\, without fear that “its entire life is yesterday\, holding it in its past.” \nNatalia Bolani seeks her own interpretation from her perspective as an actor\, resignifying and valuing the chosen texts through contemporary sounds\, mainly appealing to the sound of the piano and the bandoneón\, instruments with strong organic and referential connotations in Rio de la Plata culture. \nThe project intends to attract new audiences to this genre\, as well as to offer a repertoire not usually enjoyed by those more familiar with the music. Its raison d’être is\, ultimately\, the encounter with the emotions\, a meeting where interpretive and sonorous power intermingle in the same waters\, in a kind of cathartic ritual through artistic creation. \nPresented by the Embassy of Uruguay and MLC Estates LLP \n  \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:SpaceAge Solutions
DESCRIPTION:India\, being one of the developing countries in the world\, does face many challenges when it comes to taking up specific developmental projects for the benefit of the people. Natural resources management and societal applications are the biggest areas for India where the Government spends lots of funds for the benefit of its people. \nGovernment spendings of public money in many important areas\, such as\, building rural and urban infrastructure\, programs on land & water conservation\, agriculture\, water\, forests\, energy and many others to ensure sustainable development of all basic needs of the people\, are efforts towards achieving our sustainable developmental goals. This calls for meticulous planning and well-orchestrated implementation and monitoring. \nSpace technology provides many interesting solutions in terms of Earth observation\, communication and GNSS based solutions. The presentation brings out specific areas where such solutions are being provided to the Government using space technology so that the goals of development and governance are met amicably. \nThe talk by Prof. Diwakar will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nThis session is part of the Let’s Talk Climate Change Talk series. \nPresented by: \n \n
