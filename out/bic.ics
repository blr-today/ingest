SUMMARY:The Body Leads the Mind
DESCRIPTION:Drawing from Commedia dell’arte\, clowning\, and physical theatre\, this workshop puts the body first. It explores how physical action\, form\, and rhythm can unlock imagination\, presence\, and emotional life in ways that psychological approaches alone cannot. \nDeveloped in collaboration with La Compagnie Dramatique\, whose long-running\, critically acclaimed comedy by Dario Fo\, The Open Couple\, has been in repertoire since 2013\, this workshop offers an inside look at the playful\, high-energy physical tools used in making a full-scale professional production\, and how they are shaped into clear\, dynamic storytelling. \nWho It’s For \nFor actors and theatre practitioners\, this workshop loosens habitual patterns\, rebuilds physical ease\, and rediscovers play. It is particularly useful if you feel blocked\, overly cerebral\, or curious about comedy and physical performance. \nFor writers\, directors\, educators\, or anyone curious about how performers work\, the principles here extend well beyond the stage. Presence\, adaptability\, attention\, and expressive freedom are skills that land anywhere. \nCuriosity\, openness\, and a willingness to play are enough. \nInside the Workshop \n\nDiscover the impact of exaggeration\, contrast and neutrality \nWitness the relationship between physical form and inner state\nExperience mindful presence\, unburdened play\, and the pleasure of being seen\nLearn to make an audience lean in with physical storytelling\, rhythm\, and clarity\nLearn how these tools are ultimately shaped in service of text and performance\n\nParticipants will engage with the kinds of physical\, rhythmic\, and embodied approaches that are used in the making of a full-scale professional production. The workshop offers an inside look at how playful\, high-energy physical exploration is later shaped\, refined\, and structured into clear storytelling and performance craft. The workshop is designed not for mastery in a single session\, but for opening doors: to imagination\, confidence\, and a deeper appreciation of theatrical craft. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:Viyoga - Fragments of Light
DESCRIPTION:We have drifted. From the earth beneath us\, from the quiet wisdom within\, from the stillness we once knew. \nCommissioned by Kalavaahini Trust on the occasion of their 10th Anniversary\, Viyoga is a dance performance that moves through the fractures of our time. \nBuilt on the premise of loss\, it explores how our harmony with nature quietly fades\, how the narcissistic self eclipses the deeper truth within\, and how unbridled material desires overshadow the spiritual depth that sustains us. \nThrough movement and silence\, Viyoga asks us to pause\, witness\, and rediscover what binds us. \nProduction Credits: \nConcept\, Choreography & Lead: Vaibhav Arekar\nCreative Consultant: Malavika Sarukkas\nMusic Composition & Vocal: Karthik Hebbar\nLights & Costumes: Sushant Jadhav\nArtistic Director: Sushant Jadhav\nPercussion Design: Satish Krishnamurthy\nEnsemble: Eesha Pinglay\, Swarada Bhave\, Poorva Saraswat\, Gautam Marathe\, Anu Christi Pillai\nOrchestra: Madhuri Seshadri (Vocal)\, Suma Rani (Sitar)\, Shrinidhi Mattur (Violin)\, Shubha (Veena)\, Vivek Krishna (Flute)\, Venu (Keyboard)\nRecording: Omkar Studio\, Bangalore (Shrinidhi Omkar)\nPoets: Kabir\, Sharad Chandra\, Sant Tukaram\, Annamacharya\, Da.

SUMMARY:Tell Me a Story about Our World
DESCRIPTION:A single family. A small village. An entire nation’s story hiding inside. \nTell Me A Story About Our World brings together academic and translator Vanamala Viswanatha and novelist Kavery Nambisan for a conversation about the art of fiction and storytelling\, based on Nambisan’s latest novel\, Rising Sons. Set in a village in Karnataka\, following one family from pre-independent India through to the 1970s\, threading through the complexities of caste and colonialism while painting vivid landscapes of rural and urban life in a bygone era. \nWhat makes Rising Sons sing is how Nambisan inhabits her world. Kannada coexists comfortably within the English\, not as a novelty but as a force of realism\, enabling the reader’s sensibility to percolate through society at every level. Then there is the narrator: never formally introduced\, yet unmistakably present\, speaking of “our village” and “our daily lives” with a voice that is not quite impartial. The resulting text reads as both narration and remembrance\, an immersion into a carefully crafted world. \nThe stories we tell are as much about the Word as they are about the World. Expect an interesting and illuminating conversation\, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Invisible Empire
DESCRIPTION:You’ve received the call. The scam artist trying to get your information. Perhaps you fell for it\, perhaps you knew better. In either case\, it becomes a story to tell over coffee. \nBut who are the people on the other end of line? \nIn her new book\, Scamlands\, journalist Snidha Poonam explores the vast fraud economies stretching from small-town India to global scam hubs. Nuanced\, detailed and above all\, personal\, Poonam reports on the many lives that run parallel to our own. Tracing the supply chains of fraud\, she reveals an economy that’s both ruthlessly efficient and heartbreakingly human. \nIn this talk\, she is joined by columnist Aakar Patel to explore the themes of the book. They will examine how scam economies thrive in the gaps of inequality\, why trust is collapsing faster than we can rebuild it\, and what it means when fraud becomes a viable career path for an entire generation. The session ends with an audience Q&A. \nThere are no easy answers\, but you’ll know more when that unknown number calls again. \n

SUMMARY:AI as a Creative Partner
DESCRIPTION:A tool is only as good as the hands that wield it. \nAnd AI is\, after all\, another tool. \nThis talk explores how Artificial Intelligence functions as a collaborator for creativity: accelerating exploration\, provoking new directions\, and sharpening creative judgment. The session opens with live demonstrations that surface instinctive reactions to AI-generated content\, then lifts the veil on how these systems actually work and why their outputs can feel genuinely creative. No jargon\, just clarity on what’s happening under the hood and why it’s more interesting than you might expect. \nA live co-creation segment puts theory into practice. Using tools like ChatGPT\, Suno\, and Midjourney\, the session demonstrates real creative workflows in action. You’ll discover that the power lives in iteration\, selection\, and rejection\, revealing how human judgment shapes everything that emerges from these systems. \nAI represents the next generation of creative tools\, shifting how creation happens\, not why it happens. Intent remains yours. Taste remains yours. Meaning remains yours. The talk concludes by exploring the questions that make this moment genuinely intriguing: authorship\, originality\, bias\, ethics. As AI makes output abundant and accessible\, your context\, lived experience\, and values determine what’s worth making in the first place. \n

SUMMARY:Embracing the Broken
DESCRIPTION:Reconsider what it means to be whole. \nIn the Japanese art of Kintsugi\, fracture lines become illumination. Damage transforms into something worth keeping. \nRed House brings this meditative practice to Bangalore after reaching over 20\,000 participants across India. Their space in Okhla is itself a product of this philosophy: once an abandoned factory\, it was converted into a thriving cultural hub in 2022. Now one of Delhi’s pioneering hubs for this ancient art\, Red House invites you to experience the ritual firsthand. \nThe process is simple but deliberate. Select a ceramic piece\, break it with intention using a hammer\, then carefully mend it\, watching as golden seams emerge where cracks once lived. Traditional Kintsugi uses lacquer and gold powder in a painstaking\, multi-step technique that can take weeks. This workshop offers a more accessible approach\, allowing you to complete the full arc of breaking and repair in a single session. You’ll leave with a vessel wearing its history openly\, a reminder that our fractures\, when tended to\, can become the most beautiful part of us. \nAn act of creation that insists our faults and repairs are worth displaying. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:In Search of Rain
DESCRIPTION:Can you turn trash into treasure? \nLed by 6th and 7th graders from Ramagondanahalli Government School\, this shadow puppetry workshop is all about having fun while helping the Earth. \nYou’ll create your own puppets\, invent exciting stories about sustainability\, and put on a shadow theatre performance. It’s playful\, it’s creative\, and you’ll show others how reusing simple materials can make a big difference for our planet! \nNote: Do you have extra paper bags at home? Bring them along! \n\nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins\, not with a ticket\, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion\, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet\, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday\, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return\, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books\, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \n\nSupported by:\n\n

SUMMARY:An Orphanage of Memories
DESCRIPTION:21 minutes | Kashmiri and Hindi with English subtitles | 2024 | India \nWhen grief becomes obsession. \nAfter losing her husband under mysterious circumstances\, Farah clings to his memory through the saplings he brought to their kitchen garden. But when rats threaten the fragile plants\, and a land buyer threatens her home\, Farah’s devotion spirals into dangerous obsession. \nIt is shot during Kashmir’s bleakest season\, deliberately stripping away the region’s famous beauty to focus on something rarely seen in Indian cinema: the inner life of a Kashmiri woman\, not the postcard landscape around her. \nFollowing the screening will be a discussion with the Film Director\, Rayit Hashmat Qazi and Research Analyst\, Aishwaria Sonavane. The session will close with an audience Q&A. \n  \n

SUMMARY:Life in Metaphors
DESCRIPTION:84 minutes | English & Kannada with English subtitles | India | 2015 \nWhen banker Om Prakash Srivastava attended a 2012 FTII master class with Girish Kasaravalli\, one screening of Dweepa changed everything. Inspired\, he abandoned his career to create this National Award-winning portrait of India’s most decorated filmmaker. \nSrivastava brings together luminaries including Adoor Gopalakrishnan\, Deepti Naval\, Shyam Benegal\, and U.R. Ananthamurthy\, who illuminate Kasaravalli’s remarkable journey from Ghatashraddha (1975) to Koormavatara (2013). Across fifteen National Award-winning films\, Kasaravalli has built a cinema of silence\, metaphor\, and moral inquiry. \nCrafted with sensitivity and restraint\, Life in Metaphors reveals how everyday life\, memory\, and folklore transform into enduring images on screen. It is both portrait and meditation on the art of seeing itself. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with the filmmaker. \n

SUMMARY:Where Football Is Life
DESCRIPTION:What is India’s style of football? \nIt’s a question most people have never thought to ask. Sandeep Menon decided to find out. He travelled through India’s football heartlands\, from the hills of the northeast to the coasts of Kerala to the flatlands of Bengal\, searching for the game beneath the game. He mapped our country through its football culture in his book\, Sacred Grounds: The Journey Through People’s Football in India. \nIn this talk\, Sandeep brings those stories to life. The local heroes nobody outside their village has heard of. The formats (Sevens\, Khep\, Basti tournaments) that have their own rules\, their own rituals\, their own worlds. The communities for whom football isn’t a sport so much as a language. \nThis is football as identity\, as belonging\, as something worth fighting to keep alive. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A. Bring your questions. \n

SUMMARY:Cinema Pe Cinema
DESCRIPTION:62 minutes | English\, Hindi & Tamil with English subtitles | 2024 | India \nCinema Pe Cinema: The Theatres. The Movies. And Us. weaves a memory-scape of lives shaped by India’s single-screen cinemas. Through the recollections of people who worked in these theatres and those who loved them\, the film traces the intimate\, often complex relationships between cinema halls\, the movies they screened\, and the communities they served. In doing so\, it tells the story of India’s small cinemas as a social and cultural history: one deeply entwined with the country’s political and social transformations over the first century of cinema. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion between the Director\, Vani Subramanian and Usha Rao\, Anthropologist & Independent Media Maker. The session will close with an audience Q&A. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Resilience: Lessons from Everest
DESCRIPTION:900 meters from the summit of Everest\, Samir Patham and Sauraj Jhingan turned around. \nAfter six years of failed attempts and multiple near-death experiences\, they walked away from the dream that had consumed them. That moment of surrender? That’s the real mountain. \nIn this multimedia talk based on their new book\, What’s Your Everest? (Bloomsbury)\, Samir and Sauraj strip the heroism from the world’s highest peak. Through expedition films\, fireside conversation\, and an open Q&A\, they unpack the unglamorous truth behind the glory of the summit: frostbitten hands at 8\,000 meters\, relief work after tragedy\, and the brutal discipline of trying again. This is about failure\, leadership\, ego\, and the invisible mountains we all face: ambition\, burnout\, fear\, and the gap between wanting something and the willingness to suffer for it. \nWhat’s your Everest? And what’s stopping you from taking the next step? \n\n

SUMMARY:First-Hand
DESCRIPTION:First-hand. First\, Hand. \nAn experience that begins with the hand\, with touch. The most direct sense through which we connect with the world. \nBlindfolded\, headphones on\, you’re guided through forests\, seas\, and desert plains for 90 minutes.

SUMMARY:Vāsané
DESCRIPTION:Bangalore smells. \nJasmine at dawn\, petrol in traffic\, filter coffee and wet earth after the first rain\, incense curling through temple courtyards\, garbage fermenting in afternoon heat. We live inside this rich olfactory landscape\, but rarely pause to notice it. \nIndu Antony\, however\, has been mapping it for years. \nIn this 90-minute lecture-demonstration\, Antony presents findings from Vāsané\, Bangalore’s first smell archive. Part urban anthropology\, part sensory memoir\, the work traces how scent carries memory\, class\, labour\, and belonging in ways the visual record cannot. Smell resists documentation. It’s intimate\, fleeting\, impossible to photograph. Which makes it a different kind of archive entirely. \nAntony walks you through her practice of mapping the city with her nose. The streets\, markets\, lakes\, and corners where Bangalore announces itself before you see it. How smell marks territory\, signals change\, and holds what we’ve lost. The lecture weaves fieldwork\, personal narrative\, and reflection on what it means to archive something so fugitive. \nThe session closes with a guided encounter: select scent-notes from the city\, experienced in silence. An invitation to notice how your body remembers place beyond images and language. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:THOL
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever heard a kudamuzha? The five-faced drum disappeared centuries ago. As did the yaazh harp\, the urumi\, the parai. Instruments that once shaped Tamil ritual soundscapes\, gone silent. \nUrupaanar brought them back. \nTHOL is their debut album\, the world’s first recorded entirely on the yaazh. It’s also a live performance\, a sonic excavation of Tamil antiquity where music becomes a site of memory and landscape. Drawing from Sangam-era traditions\, the eight-piece collective uses reconstructed ancient instruments to create sound that is both archival and immediate. \nThe performance follows the thinai system from Tolkāppiyam\, which understands emotion as inseparable from environment. Mountains\, forests\, farmlands\, seashores\, arid regions: each landscape gives rise to distinct emotional states and rhythms. Feeling is shaped by climate\, terrain\, flora\, sound\, movement. Music emerges from ecology\, carrying the textures of place and the sensorial conditions of lived life. \nNinety minutes of ancient sonic ecosystems reactivated in contemporary performance. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Call of the Flute
DESCRIPTION:Krishna’s flute has been stopping the world for centuries. \nGopis mid-chore. Lotuses mid-bloom. Cows mid-graze. Everything bends toward that sound. \nShan Bhatnagar’s hand moves across cloth\, Krishna taking form as the painting grows. Amrita Lahiri becomes the story\, Kuchipudi’s precise geometry turning devotion into movement. Hrishikesh Majumdar plays the flute that started it all. \nPichwai is stillness\, detail\, meditation. Kuchipudi is energy\, expression\, the body as instrument. One from Nathadwara’s havelis\, one from Andhra’s temple courtyards. A thousand kilometres between them\, the same longing underneath. \nIt begins with the flute\, then the painting blooms\, and the dance answers. \nSomewhere in the space between sound\, movement\, and image\, devotion becomes tangible. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see.

SUMMARY:Notes That Linger
DESCRIPTION:A performance of Western classical music. But not quite your traditional piano recital. \nThe pieces are famous. Debussy\, Scarlatti\, Liszt\, Grieg\, Brahms\, Sorabji\, Copland. You may have heard some of them before. That is the point. Repetition does not preserve meaning\, it changes it. The same notes\, heard again\, evoke different emotions. \nEach piece arrives with a scent. The music reaches you through the ear. The fragrance reaches you somewhere you can’t quite name. Between the two\, something surfaces: the specific\, vivid kind of memory that belongs only to you. \nWoven through is a conversation about music\, scent and sensation: how memory is invoked without words\, without warning\, without intention. \nThe piano is waiting. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \nSupported by: \n    Contact        \n

SUMMARY:The Far Post
DESCRIPTION:Nobody said the afterlife would be fair. \nTwo enemy soldiers die in battle and find themselves at the same border crossing into the afterlife. The officer in charge is a Postman Aunty with a pet goldfish and a makeshift post office that serves both sides of the conflict equally. As the soldiers navigate what comes next\, letters from the war begin to surface. Masks shift\, puppets move\, bodies speak. \nDirector Yuki Ellias built a show without words\, letting movement do the work. Sofiyum\, a Sikkimese band\, fills the stage with music that weaves Lepcha folk traditions into something entirely its own. The songs\, created in Lepcha with the Dur See Brothers\, give the show a sound world as specific and ethereal as its setting. \nCold mountains. A border cutting through no man’s land. A goldfish. And somewhere in the middle of all of it\, peace feels close\, just like a spring morning. \nProduction Credits:\nStory\, Direction\, Actor: Yuki Ellias\nActor\, Choreographer: Tapas Boro\nMusic and Sound: Sofiyum Band: Mickma Tshering Lepcha\, Ongyal Tshering Lepcha\, Noel J. Karthak\, Rathap Lepcha\, Pintsok Dechen Lepcha\, Rikel Lepcha\nAdditional Sound Design and Music: Arnob Bal\nAdditional Voiceovers: Saymoo Lepcha\, Herlamit Lepcha\, Takzen Lepcha\nCostumes: Sumaiya Merchant\nProps and Masks Design: Mati Rajput\nLight Design: Asmit Pathare\nSound and Projection Operator: Priyanka Babbar\nLight Operators: Vikrant Thakar\, Sanket Parkhe\nSound Engineer: Lazarus Edward D’Souza\nSet Execution: Niranjan Jadhao\nPostman Aunty Masks: Pierre Filliez\nCo-Deviser: Priyanshu Gupta\nGuest Choreographer: Neeraj Lohni\nShow Manager and Stage Manager: Phalguni Vittal Rao\nSpecial Thanks: Second-year students of B.Voc.

SUMMARY:Navrasa and I
DESCRIPTION:Nine rasas. Nine ragas. \nIndrayuddh Majumdar has spent years mapping the fundamental human emotions onto the traditional ragas built to hold them. Trained in the Senia Maihar gharana\, he knows where shringar lives in a phrase\, where karuna turns\, where shanta finally settles. \nHe walks us through that map. Each rasa has a story\, and each story\, a raga. With Roopak Kallurkar on tabla\, not much is left unsaid. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:A Woman Or Not to Be
DESCRIPTION:You know this story. \nA death in the royal family. A ghost with demands. A protagonist tipping toward madness\, or something that looks like it. Revenge as the only logical conclusion. \nPut a woman in the centre. The axis shifts. \nDoes the ghost get believed? Does the grief get room\, or a diagnosis? And what happens when the ghost doesn’t ask for revenge at all\, but tells her daughter to protect herself through education? \nPrincess Hamlet is twenty\, home from college\, fluent in manga and martial arts\, and entirely unprepared for what her mother’s ghost is asking of her. Adishakti’s production departs sharply from Shakespeare\, and in that departure\, asks what we’ve always taken for granted about grief\, power\, and who gets to act on either. \nWritten\, adapted and directed by Vinay Kumar. Nimmy Raphel plays a Hamlet the original never imagined. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see.
