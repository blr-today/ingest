SUMMARY:In Search of Rain
DESCRIPTION:Can you turn trash into treasure? \nLed by 6th and 7th graders from GHPS Ramagondanahalli- an Inventure Academy Community School\, this shadow puppetry workshop is all about having fun while helping the Earth. \nYou’ll create your own puppets\, invent exciting stories about sustainability\, and put on a shadow theatre performance. It’s playful\, it’s creative\, and you’ll show others how reusing simple materials can make a big difference for our planet! \nNote: Do you have extra paper bags at home? Bring them along! \n\nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins\, not with a ticket\, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion\, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet\, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday\, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return\, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books\, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \n\nSupported by:\n\n

SUMMARY:An Orphanage of Memories
DESCRIPTION:21 minutes | Kashmiri and Hindi with English subtitles | 2024 | India \nWhen grief becomes obsession. \nAfter losing her husband under mysterious circumstances\, Farah clings to his memory through the saplings he brought to their kitchen garden. But when rats threaten the fragile plants\, and a land buyer threatens her home\, Farah’s devotion spirals into dangerous obsession. \nIt is shot during Kashmir’s bleakest season\, deliberately stripping away the region’s famous beauty to focus on something rarely seen in Indian cinema: the inner life of a Kashmiri woman\, not the postcard landscape around her. \nFollowing the screening will be a discussion with the Film Director\, Rayit Hashmat Qazi and Research Analyst\, Aishwaria Sonavane. The session will close with an audience Q&A. \n  \n

SUMMARY:From the Middle East
DESCRIPTION:Padua to Bangalore. Oud to Oud.\nLuca Chiavinato and Jagadeesh Ramanujam Mudambi in concert and conversation. \nThe Arabic scale didn’t stay in the Middle East\, it traveled the world. From Flamenco’s fierce footwork\, to jazz’s notes\, and ultimately across trade routes into Indian classical music. Most listeners miss these connections. Luca and Jagadeesh won’t let you. \nThey will demonstrate the journey of the scale on the microtonal Oud and guitar\, with vocals from Madhuri Jagadeesh and Jataveda Banerjee illuminating the overlap of traditions. \nInsight\, interplay\, and the occasional revelation about music you thought you knew. \nArtists:\nLuca Chiavinato – Oud\nJagadeesh Ramanujam Mudambi – Oud\, Guitar\nMadhuri Jagadeesh – Vocals\nJataveda Banerjee – Vocals \n

SUMMARY:Life in Metaphors
DESCRIPTION:84 minutes | English & Kannada with English subtitles | India | 2015 \nWhen banker Om Prakash Srivastava attended a 2012 FTII master class with Girish Kasaravalli\, one screening of Dweepa changed everything. Inspired\, he abandoned his career to create this National Award-winning portrait of India’s most decorated filmmaker. \nSrivastava brings together luminaries including Adoor Gopalakrishnan\, Deepti Naval\, Shyam Benegal\, and U.R. Ananthamurthy\, who illuminate Kasaravalli’s remarkable journey from Ghatashraddha (1975) to Koormavatara (2013). Across fifteen National Award-winning films\, Kasaravalli has built a cinema of silence\, metaphor\, and moral inquiry. \nCrafted with sensitivity and restraint\, Life in Metaphors reveals how everyday life\, memory\, and folklore transform into enduring images on screen. It is both portrait and meditation on the art of seeing itself. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion with the filmmaker. \n

SUMMARY:Cinema Pe Cinema
DESCRIPTION:62 minutes | English\, Hindi & Tamil with English subtitles | 2024 | India \nCinema Pe Cinema: The Theatres. The Movies. And Us. weaves a memory-scape of lives shaped by India’s single-screen cinemas. Through the recollections of people who worked in these theatres and those who loved them\, the film traces the intimate\, often complex relationships between cinema halls\, the movies they screened\, and the communities they served. In doing so\, it tells the story of India’s small cinemas as a social and cultural history: one deeply entwined with the country’s political and social transformations over the first century of cinema. \nThe screening will be followed by a discussion between the Director\, Vani Subramanian and Usha Rao\, Anthropologist & Independent Media Maker. The session will close with an audience Q&A. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Where Football Is Life
DESCRIPTION:What is India’s style of football? \nIt’s a question most people have never thought to ask. Sandeep Menon decided to find out. He travelled through India’s football heartlands\, from the hills of the northeast to the coasts of Kerala to the flatlands of Bengal\, searching for the game beneath the game. He mapped our country through its football culture in his book\, Sacred Grounds: The Journey Through People’s Football in India. \nIn this talk\, Sandeep brings those stories to life. The local heroes nobody outside their village has heard of. The formats (Sevens\, Khep\, Basti tournaments) that have their own rules\, their own rituals\, their own worlds. The communities for whom football isn’t a sport so much as a language. \nThis is football as identity\, as belonging\, as something worth fighting to keep alive. \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A. Bring your questions. \n

SUMMARY:Witnessing Historic Regime Changes
DESCRIPTION:\nOne diplomat. Four decades. An entire world in upheaval. \nFrom the dying days of the Soviet Union to the streets of Burma\, from a kingdom being absorbed into India to the two Germanys becoming one\, this memoir traces an extraordinary career lived at the fault lines of history. \nWritten by a former Indian diplomat\, the book moves across the Soviet Union\, Sikkim\, Burma\, South Korea\, Germany\, Ukraine and Indonesia\, charting four decades of geopolitical transformation through the eyes of someone who was there. Not in the briefing rooms of power\, but on the ground\, watching\, listening\, and recording what ordinary people wanted for their lives: freedom\, openness\, dignity. \nRunning through it all is a quieter story\, of India itself\, navigating a turbulent world as a non-aligned nation\, finding its footing politically and economically while the old order collapsed around it. \nThis is history as it was lived. Up close\, and impossible to look away from. \n\n

SUMMARY:Resilience: Lessons from Everest
DESCRIPTION:900 meters from the summit of Everest\, Samir Patham and Sauraj Jhingan turned around. \nAfter six years of failed attempts and multiple near-death experiences\, they walked away from the dream that had consumed them. That moment of surrender? That’s the real mountain. \nIn this multimedia talk based on their new book\, What’s Your Everest? (Bloomsbury)\, Samir and Sauraj strip the heroism from the world’s highest peak. Through expedition films\, fireside conversation\, and an open Q&A\, they unpack the unglamorous truth behind the glory of the summit: frostbitten hands at 8\,000 meters\, relief work after tragedy\, and the brutal discipline of trying again. This is about failure\, leadership\, ego\, and the invisible mountains we all face: ambition\, burnout\, fear\, and the gap between wanting something and the willingness to suffer for it. \nWhat’s your Everest? And what’s stopping you from taking the next step? \n\n

SUMMARY:Bookmarked
DESCRIPTION:Romance. Bromance. Family. Faith. \nLove knows no bounds\, and this reading session celebrates all its forms! \nThrough diverse voices and stories\, we’ll explore how love shows up in daily rituals\, acts of courage\, chosen family\, and quiet moments of care. Bring your own experiences as we discover together the many ways love gives meaning to our lives. \nAtta Galata adds to the experience with a curated selection of quick reads by Indian authors\, perfect for browsing or discovery. After the reading hour\, the silence gently gives way to conversation; an easy exchange about the books that stayed with you\, surprised you\, or shaped your perspective on love. \nThere’s something magical about a room full of people lost in their own worlds yet together in the same space. No pressure\, no performance. Just pages\, pauses\, and the rare pleasure of reading in truly good company! \nThis event is part of our Programmes at the Library series at BIC. \nWe’re reimagining the BIC Library as a warm\, welcoming space for connection and exploration. Through thoughtfully curated sessions\, we aim to engage the diverse interests and ages within our community. Our goal is to create an enriching environment for discovery\, experimentation\, and collaboration\, beyond the books on our shelves! \nWe welcome your ideas and input. If you have ideas for events or activities that align with our vision\, we’d be delighted to hear from you.

SUMMARY:Chashma | Blind Spot
DESCRIPTION:26 minutes | Hindi with English subtitles | India | 2024 \nInnocence is not a lack of intelligence. \nChildren often see clearly what adults choose to ignore. \nSupriyo is an 11-year-old boy with poor vision navigating 1992 India: a time of rising sociopolitical tensions. When a school conflict forces him to make an impossible choice\, he confronts more than his physical limitations. He must face the emotional and societal blind spots all around him. \nInspired by episodes from his own childhood\, director Nitin Baid has crafted a film that honors how children experience truth. Written by Varun Grover and starring Ayan Khan alongside National Award winner Konkona Sen Sharma\, Chashma premiered at MAMI Mumbai Film Festival. The film has won Best Film at DC South Asian Film Festival\, Best Director at Indian Independent Film Festival\, and Best Actor at Filmfare 2025\, travelling to over 30 festivals across four continents. \nStay after the screening for an intimate Q&A with director Nitin Baid. \n

SUMMARY:Pravāha 2026

SUMMARY:What Is It to Learn?
DESCRIPTION:Your brain is doing something incredible right now. \nJust by reading this\, you’re taking in information\, making connections\, and building a picture of the world\, without even trying. But what if you could understand how that works? \nIn this workshop\, we get into the science and philosophy behind learning itself. How do your senses shape what you believe? Why do two people experience the same moment completely differently? And what does that mean for how you see\, and question\, everything around you? \nThrough sharp discussion and some genuinely surprising ideas\, you’ll leave thinking about your own mind in a way you never have before. \n\nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins\, not with a ticket\, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion\, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet\, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday\, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return\, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books\, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \n\nSupported by:\n\n

SUMMARY:Vāsané
DESCRIPTION:Bangalore smells. \nJasmine at dawn\, petrol in traffic\, filter coffee and wet earth after the first rain\, incense curling through temple courtyards\, garbage fermenting in afternoon heat. We live inside this rich olfactory landscape\, but rarely pause to notice it. \nIndu Antony\, however\, has been mapping it for years. \nIn this 90-minute lecture-demonstration\, Antony presents findings from Vāsané\, Bangalore’s first smell archive. Part urban anthropology\, part sensory memoir\, the work traces how scent carries memory\, class\, labour\, and belonging in ways the visual record cannot. Smell resists documentation. It’s intimate\, fleeting\, impossible to photograph. Which makes it a different kind of archive entirely. \nAntony walks you through her practice of mapping the city with her nose. The streets\, markets\, lakes\, and corners where Bangalore announces itself before you see it. How smell marks territory\, signals change\, and holds what we’ve lost. The lecture weaves fieldwork\, personal narrative\, and reflection on what it means to archive something so fugitive. \nThe session closes with a guided encounter: select scent-notes from the city\, experienced in silence. An invitation to notice how your body remembers place beyond images and language. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Grounded: A Food and Body Coffee Lab
DESCRIPTION:The warmth in your palm. The bitterness on your tongue. \nIn Bengaluru\, coffee is everywhere: filter coffee at dawn\, café meetings at noon\, the rhythms of work and rest poured into cups. Behind every sip: the land it came from\, the hands that picked it\, the ecologies it depends on. \nOver 2.5 hours\, Shubhra Chatterji guides you through her Body & Food Method. Movement\, embodied writing\, sensory exercises. Before the first sip\, you’ll listen to the drip and pour. Feel the heat in your hands. Notice what surfaces when the taste hits. \nWhat you thought was just routine turns into archive. The way you hold the cup. The wait before drinking. The memories which surface with the first taste. Your body has been keeping records. \nRoutine. Ritual. Archive. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:THOL
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever heard a kudamuzha? The five-faced drum disappeared centuries ago. As did the yaazh harp\, the urumi\, the parai. Instruments that once shaped Tamil ritual soundscapes\, gone silent. \nUrupaanar brought them back. \nTHOL is their debut album\, the world’s first recorded entirely on the yaazh. It’s also a live performance\, a sonic excavation of Tamil antiquity where music becomes a site of memory and landscape. Drawing from Sangam-era traditions\, the eight-piece collective uses reconstructed ancient instruments to create sound that is both archival and immediate. \nThe performance follows the thinai system from Tolkāppiyam\, which understands emotion as inseparable from environment. Mountains\, forests\, farmlands\, seashores\, arid regions: each landscape gives rise to distinct emotional states and rhythms. Feeling is shaped by climate\, terrain\, flora\, sound\, movement. Music emerges from ecology\, carrying the textures of place and the sensorial conditions of lived life. \nNinety minutes of ancient sonic ecosystems reactivated in contemporary performance. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see.

SUMMARY:Call of the Flute
DESCRIPTION:A dark body draped in yellow. Flower garland\, peacock feather. You know the image. \nWhen Lord Krishna plays his flute\, everything bends toward that sound. The cow freezes mid-graze\, standing on one leg. The gopi stops mid-task. The lotus pauses mid-bloom. For centuries\, Indian artists have followed that call. \nPichwai comes from Rajasthan’s temple havelis\, worship made visible on cloth. Kuchipudi from Andhra’s villages\, stories told through the body. Opposite ends of India\, both Vaishnavite traditions holding the same images sacred. \nTogether on stage is an unlikely trio: Pichwai painter Shan Bhatnagar\, Kuchipudi dancer Amrita Lahiri\, flautist Hrishikesh Majumdar. Each devoted to their form\, each form devoted to Krishna. Bhatnagar walks you through his paintings between dance pieces. Lahiri responds\, those frozen moments coming alive through movement. Majumdar’s flute ties it together\, the sound that makes devotion inevitable. \nNorth and South. Stillness and motion. The call and the answer. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see.

SUMMARY:Notes That Linger
DESCRIPTION:A performance of Western classical music. But not quite your traditional piano recital. \nThe pieces are famous. Debussy\, Scarlatti\, Liszt\, Grieg\, Brahms\, Sorabji\, Copland. You may have heard some of them before. That is the point. Repetition does not preserve meaning\, it changes it. The same notes\, heard again\, evoke different emotions. \nEach piece arrives with a scent. The music reaches you through the ear. The fragrance reaches you somewhere you can’t quite name. Between the two\, something surfaces: the specific\, vivid kind of memory that belongs only to you. \nWoven through is a conversation about music\, scent and sensation: how memory is invoked without words\, without warning\, without intention. \nThe piano is waiting. \n \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see.

SUMMARY:The Far Post
DESCRIPTION:Nobody said the afterlife would be fair. \nTwo enemy soldiers die in battle and find themselves at the same border crossing into the afterlife. The officer in charge is a Postman Aunty with a pet goldfish and a makeshift post office that serves both sides of the conflict equally. As the soldiers navigate what comes next\, letters from the war begin to surface. Masks shift\, puppets move\, bodies speak. \nDirector Yuki Ellias built a show without words\, letting movement do the work. Sofiyum\, a Sikkimese band\, fills the stage with music that weaves Lepcha folk traditions into something entirely its own. The songs\, created in Lepcha with the Dur See Brothers\, give the show a sound world as specific and ethereal as its setting. \nCold mountains. A border cutting through no man’s land. A goldfish. And somewhere in the middle of all of it\, peace feels close\, just like a spring morning. \nProduction Credits:\nStory\, Direction\, Actor: Yuki Ellias\nActor\, Choreographer: Tapas Boro\nMusic and Sound: Sofiyum Band: Mickma Tshering Lepcha\, Ongyal Tshering Lepcha\, Noel J.

SUMMARY:Navrasa and I
DESCRIPTION:Nine rasas. Nine ragas. \nIndrayuddh Majumdar has spent years mapping the fundamental human emotions onto the traditional ragas built to hold them. Trained in the Senia Maihar gharana\, he knows where shringar lives in a phrase\, where karuna turns\, where shanta finally settles. \nHe walks us through that map. Each rasa has a story\, and each story\, a raga. With Roopak Kallurkar on tabla\, not much is left unsaid. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:A Woman Or Not to Be
DESCRIPTION:You know this story. \nA death in the royal family. A ghost with demands. A protagonist tipping toward madness\, or something that looks like it. Revenge as the only logical conclusion. \nPut a woman in the centre. The axis shifts. \nDoes the ghost get believed? Does the grief get room\, or a diagnosis? And what happens when the ghost doesn’t ask for revenge at all\, but tells her daughter to protect herself through education? \nPrincess Hamlet is twenty\, home from college\, fluent in manga and martial arts\, and entirely unprepared for what her mother’s ghost is asking of her. Adishakti’s production departs sharply from Shakespeare\, and in that departure\, asks what we’ve always taken for granted about grief\, power\, and who gets to act on either. \nWritten\, adapted and directed by Vinay Kumar. Nimmy Raphel plays a Hamlet the original never imagined. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:The Percussive Pathway
DESCRIPTION:Sound hits your eardrums. Percussion resonates through your entire body. \nPercussionist Rahul Vanamali starts there. He walks you through two instruments: the vibraphone and the snare drum. Their histories and techniques. Then works that have never been performed in India. Pieces that pull sounds you didn’t know these instruments could make. \nThen he hands you the sticks. \nYou’ll feel how a whisper-touch on a drum head creates depth. How striking the same bar in different spots shifts the tone. Sound\, yes. But also vibration traveling up your arms\, the hum settling in your ribs. After that\, the room plays together. Vanamali has arranged ensemble passages that work even if you’ve never held a mallet before. Sync with strangers into a rhythm you can feel in the floor. \nVanamali spent years discovering these instruments\, jolted by wonder when sound became something physical. It is your turn now! \nPlease Note: Limited to 20 participants per session. \nSession Schedule:\n11am – 12noon\n12:30pm – 1:30pm\n2:30pm – 3:30pm\n4:30pm – 5:30pm \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:Making the Ephemeral
DESCRIPTION:Scent travels across time. You just don’t think about it that way. \nA whiff of jasmine connects you to rituals performed two thousand years ago. Sandalwood routes that crossed continents. Rose attar distilled using techniques older than most written records. Perfume holds ecology\, trade\, memory\, and craft in a single drop. \nJames McHugh lectures on smell in early Indian religion and culture. How scent functioned in ritual. How aromatics were understood\, classified\, traded across ancient networks. Then\, a conversation with Bengaluru-based perfumer Ahalya Matthan and anthropologist-perfumer Giti Datt. They work with traditional attars\, the concentrated fragrances India has been making for centuries. You’ll hear about the science behind distillation\, the artistry in blending\, the labor in every bottle. \nHistory\, distilled. \nImage credits: \nThumbnail – Full bhapkas sitting in the corner of a distillery\, so that the distillate can settle overnight.

SUMMARY:Kadahin Milandaasin | ڪڏهن ملنداسين
DESCRIPTION:Some homelands you’ve never seen\, but you long for them anyway. \nComposer and drummer Tarun Balani never set foot in Sindh. Yet he knows it through his grandmother’s stories\, through words in a half-remembered language\, through melodies that surfaced decades after Partition. \nThe Tarun Balani Quartet features trumpeter Sonja Ott\, guitarist Siddharth Gautam\, pianist Luke Marantz. Four musicians from four countries playing music about belonging nowhere and everywhere at once. Contemporary jazz meets Sindhi folk. Improvisation meets tradition. The sound shifts the way memory does when you try to hold it still. \nFamily archives and oral histories thread through the performance. Live improvisation responds to what the room holds. You’ll be invited to offer something: a memory\, a word in a language slipping away\, an image of a place you carry. The quartet takes it in. Lets it shape the music. What you share stays\, becomes part of what everyone else hears. \nKadahin Milandaasin. When will we meet? \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:Future Food Taste Test
DESCRIPTION:\nWho decided what tastes right? And who taught you what’s worth eating? \nClimate is rewriting the menu. What grows\, what travels\, and what survives the heat. Ingredients that are arriving because the world is shifting. Some adapted\, some unfamiliar. \nEdible Issues opens their climate pantry to you. Tasting in a sensory lab for a changing food future. You’ll sample items found during their fieldwork: ingredients showing up as ecosystems shift. A chance to slow down and pay attention to flavor\, texture\, aftertaste. The emotional response that arrives before you can explain it. \nBetween samples\, a conversation about the forces that built your palate. Markets that decided okra is rustic and asparagus is refined. Media that taught you which bitterness counts as sophisticated. The preferences you inherited\, questioned. \nThe ingredients are here. The verdict is yours. \n\nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see.

DESCRIPTION:Kālidāsa never met Kūṭiyāṭṭam. Until now. \nNepathya presents a scene from Abhijñānaśākuntalam\, Kālidāsa’s most celebrated play: the moment when Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā meet and fall in love. Conceived and designed by Guru Margi Madhu Chakyar\, this adaptation brings together what history kept apart. \nIn this adaptation\, the Sūta enacts Duṣyanta’s actions. Duṣyanta mirrors the deer. His responses echo Śakuntalā’s movements. What emerges is emotions synchronizing across bodies\, a complementary interplay that grew from attempting the impossible. \nKūṭiyāṭṭam stretches time. A gesture can last minutes. A glance becomes an entire emotional landscape. What you see is intensity\, immediacy\, and a particular kind of attention. \nKālidāsa. Kūṭiyāṭṭam. They meet at last. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n
