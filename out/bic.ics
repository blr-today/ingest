SUMMARY:Mirrors
DESCRIPTION:Mirrors is a creative fellowship encouraging an artistic exploration of masculinities. The inspiration for the fellowship emerged from ‘(De)constructions of Masculinities’\, a research study which undertook a critical review of approaches to programming on masculinity within the development sector. \nThe reflections and challenges shared by various civil society organizations/ unions around masculinity made us feel that there was a need for a more expansive understanding of masculinity\, which needs to move beyond merely\, reforming the behaviours of boys and men. To this end\, we invited 12 individuals from different parts of the country to produce daily ethnographies on how they perceive masculinity in and around them. Given the diversity of social locations\, their writings reveal the way in which masculinity is shaped by social differences of caste\, gender\, sexuality\, religion\, class and so on. The study made us realise that we have only scratched the surface when it comes to engaging with the vast\, often messy terrain\, of what constitutes masculinity and femininity. \nWe believe artistic practice can offer a way of expressing the silences\, frictions\, contradictions\, suppressions and desires that shape this experience. We put out an open call for applications and received an overwhelming response\, across geographies\, language\, and socio-economic locations. The works you see featured are by the 12 fellows who were selected under the fellowship. \nIn collaboration with \n \n

SUMMARY:Body and Breath: Our Sacred Spaces
DESCRIPTION:Degula | Shreema Upadhya | 35 mins \nThe human form is considered sacred across civilizations and religions. Scriptures describe its sanctity and godliness; the significance its protection holds. Just as a shrine constructed with symbolism and care houses the deity\, so does the body act as a vessel for our soul. This parallel also manifests itself in the Indian temple\, whose structure appears to mirror the human anatomy\, in both the physical and metaphysical sense. \nWhy then do we abuse this body\, hate it\, neglect it\, and constantly attempt to alter it to fit into an external mold that it was never meant to conform to? We journey thus through the length of our very being to where the worshipped resides\, with an exploration of the body through culture and time to celebrate the beauty of the imperfectly unique over the ideal\, the purpose behind the periphery. \nBreath | Deepali Salil\, Sayani Chakraborty | 45 mins \n“Breath is our maadhyam\, a conduit for our emotional well being and a spiritual gateway. Living in the breath allows us to experience our present and our body completely. It allows healing. \nHave you noticed that emotions and thoughts disturb the rhythm of your breath\, leaving it shallow\, or reluctant at the bottom of an exhale or top of an inhale? When left unchecked\, these thoughts and emotions calcifies into repeated\, reactive responses. Meditating and /or regulating our breath opens our awareness\, breaking the chain reaction of emotional and thought elaboration. We can recognize that our incessant breath is always informing us of our inner world\, while simultaneously providing us with the solutions to disturbances in our emotions\, thoughts\, and physical wellbeing. \nThis incessant breath dances within me and I seek that breath while I dance\, and when I dance there are two dancers\, one me and one Shiva. When Shiva gradually merges into me and two dancers become one. I become a manifestation of his Ananda Tandava\, where everything that moves in this universe is a beautiful dance. \nHe dances\, the world dances\, I dance and we all become one.” \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Musings in Mohiniyattam

The presentation underlines the dance form’s immense versatility and the diverse multicultural influences that have shaped Vijayalakshmi\, the artist and the person. Besides her own multi-dimensional forms of creative expression and her unique collaborations and inspirations both in India and abroad. \nThe session will conclude with a brief Q&A\, moderated by Masoom Parmar\, who is a Bangalore based artist\, curator and arts manager. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n  \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Movement\, Measure\, and the Rains
DESCRIPTION:In this concert\, Amit Chaudhuri dwells on the style\, mood and legacy of the Kunwar Shyam gharana. The compositions of the Kunwar Shyam gharana are mainly the work of the eponymous Kunwar Shyam (1850-1910) and of the extraordinary virtuoso in that lineage\, Pandit Laxman Prasad Jaipurwale (1915-1977). Kunwar Shyam engendered a number of Malhars\, testifying to an obsession with the rainy season. Laxman Prasad\, one of the great khayal composers of the twentieth century\, created slow khayals as well as a style in alap that constitute a form of meditative exploration; jod ragas (that is\, new ragas that result from combining existing ragas); and fast bandishes and taranas whose jewelled intricacy embody movement\, dance\, and measure. Together\, the compositions and their mood are characterised by a ‘balance of gravity and play’ (the phrase is from Amit Chaudhuri’s poem ‘Sweet Shop’). \nAmit Chaudhuri was the principal student in Hindustani classical music of Laxman Prasad’s son\, Pandit Govind Prasad Jaipurwale (1944-88)\, himself an exceptional artist. Chaudhuri will perform some of the compositions handed down to him by his teacher and his family between 1978-88. He will also perform a new jod raga he created himself – again\, in the spirit of conceptual play – called ‘Rammohan’\, borrowing the ‘Ram’ from raga Ramkali and the ‘Mohan’ from raga Mohankauns. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The End
DESCRIPTION:90 mins | English & Hindi \nA college romance slowly takes a turn for something complicated and traumatic. \nA young live-in couple begins to realize that maybe love isn’t all that you need\nto build a home with someone. \nDoubt\, deceit\, and the past come to haunt a marriage that is struggling to survive. \nAn anthology of 3 stories about 3 couples\, ‘The End’ uses text\, movement\, music\, and memory to understand what we look for in romance and relationships when the odds are stacked against us\, when love starts making way for loss\, and questions about desire and the need for control start popping up. How does one unlearn societal norms and expectations to build relationships that are authentic\, nurturing\, and filled with love still? \nWe meet these 3 couples near what they think is the end of their (love) stories. \nBut is it\, really\, The End? \nCredits: \nDesign & Direction: Nikhita Singh \nWriters: Nikhita Singh\, Mitali Kalagi\, Sambita De \nCast: Mitali Kalagi\, Rituparna Sanyal\, Kaustav Sinha\, Aditya Kashyap \nMovement Director: Babusha Jain \nMusic: Hashparker (Harsh Choudhary) \nLyrics & Poetry: Madhumoy Satpathy \nAssistant Director: Rituparna Sanyal \nProduction Manager & Photographer: Divyansh Thada \nProduction Assistant: Sambita De \nCostume Design: Simran Jagdale \nSet Design: Nikhita Singh\, Rituparna Sanyal\, Vivek Jadhav \nLight Design: Nikhita Singh\, Rahul Kumar \nPoster Design: Vighnesh Kharadkar\, Debosmita Mazumdar \nSocial Media Design: Tanya Vaghela \nSocial Media Planning & Strategy: Divya Sundrani \nMarketing & Publicity: Dheeraj Dubey \nCreative Director for Visual Promos: Omkar Phatak \nOutreach & Brand Advocacy Partner: Centre for Contemporary Folklore \nSupported by Tamaasha Studio Foundation’s UsPaar Residency. \n  \nThis is a BIC Elsewhere Event. \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur\, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations\, arts\, and culture directly to diverse audiences.

SUMMARY:Akhyāt - Ākhyānā 
DESCRIPTION:Words of inspiration from India’s first female teacher…  \nWritings of unabashed desire from the heart of Tamizh land…  \nQuestions of existentialism asked by Buddhist nuns…  \nProse that interrogates anthropocentrism… \nVerses that subvert gender roles and patriarchy…  \n…and more insight into the female perspective of desire\, denouncement\, faith and activism. Only this time\, through poetry authored by women themselves! \nAkhyāt – Ākhyānā is an experiential exploration of rare multilingual poetry tactfully woven into a Bharatanatyam repertoire performed along with live musicians. This work stems from Divya’s diverse encounters with heart-wrenching poetic expressions of women from across timelines and geographies\, in a quest to unearth narratives ‘by’\, ‘for’ and ‘of’ women. \nCast:\nDance | Choreography | Script – Divya Ravi\nMusic composition | Vocals – Sharan Subramanian\nNattuvangam – DV Prasanna Kumar\nMridangam – Srihari Rangaswamy\nFlute – Vivek Krishna \nSupported by:\n \n
