SUMMARY:Tasting Climate Change
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a world with no coffee! Scientists say that by 2050\, your favourite brew could very likely go extinct from changing climate – or at the very least leave you with an unpleasant taste in your cup! \nJoin us for an insightful panel discussion followed by an interactive audiovisual experience through which to discover how climate change could affect the accessibility and flavour of coffee. This session will explore the ecological history of coffee in India\, impacts of coffee production on biodiversity and producer observations of everyday climate change on their farms. The event focuses on the experiences of smallholder producers\, who are often invisibalised in global supply chains\, and whose livelihoods are particularly vulnerable to changing climate. \nOf particular interest is a climate reality – what is the evidence that climate change is occurring in coffee\, how would we experience and indeed taste its impact? To discover this\, participants will be encouraged to sample different coffees as an invitation to taste climate change. \n

SUMMARY:Mission Possible
DESCRIPTION:Indian healthcare is at a critical crossroads. \nThere has been significant improvement in the control of morbidity due to communicable diseases. On the other hand\, non-communicable diseases have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Simple community based interventions like sanitation\, clean water supply\, vector eradication and vaccination under nationwide program initiatives helped control communicable diseases. Similar strategies do not exist for non-communicable diseases\, where the prevailing paradigm is the reactive use of expensive curative services. To some extent\, the burden on patients who paid for such services out of pocket has been reduced by increase in capacity and supply of curative services under schemes like Ayushman Bharat. \nHowever\, in a system where providers control the levers of consumption\, for-profit providers are incentivized to artificially stoke consumption until demand once again catches up with supply\, setting up a vicious spiral of inflation in healthcare costs. Scaling up such a supply led healthcare system\, in order to make healthcare universally accessible\, is a recipe for unsustainable increases in healthcare costs. \nThe book Mission Possible takes a hard look at the realities of Indian healthcare and provides a way out of the unsustainable trajectory it finds itself in. Instead of considering the pieces of healthcare in isolation\, it promotes a systemwide analysis of the problems. Based on their analysis\, the authors have not hesitated to propose radical structural changes in the current system\, while providing commentary on why these changes are necessary and how they could be realized. \nA panel discussion with the authors Swami Subramaniam and Aparajithan Srivathsan along with Meena Ganesh (Founder\, Portea)\, Ashok Vellodi (Paediatrician) and Arvind Kasturi (Professor\, Community Health\, St Johns Medical College) will be followed by a Q&A Session. \nTea/ Coffee will be served from 5:30pm onwards. \nIn collaboration with the UHC Dialogues \n \n

SUMMARY:Dharmic Capitalism
DESCRIPTION:Did Rajaraja Chola\, who built the world-renowned Brihadisvara temple in Tanjore\, and Suryavarman II of Kambuja Desa (Cambodia)\, who built the world’s largest temple complex\, Angkor Wat\, erect these enduring marvels with a magic wand? Surely not. How did they nurture prosperity? What were the economic models that enabled them to leave the world awestruck? \nSriram Balasubramanian’s sequel to the pathbreaking Kautilyanomics answers these questions by examining Common Era empires and kingdoms ranging from the Cholas\, Pallavas\, Pandyas and Vijayanagara to Southeast Asian kingdoms. Balasubramanian audaciously puts forward a novel\, indigenous and sustainable framework called Dharmanomics—a function of Kautilyan Dharmic capitalism\, of a Dharmic ecosystem driven by temples and Sreni (corporate guilds) Dharma—that spans thousands of years. It was put into practice much before the likes of Adam Smith and modern economic thinkers. Dharmanomics seeks to present a coherent and structured economic framework based on the idea of Dharma for at least 1500 years. \nIn the session\, Sriram Balasubramanian will share the key aspects from his book. A Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Media Freedom: Past\, Present and Future
DESCRIPTION:\nThe media is a cornerstone of Indian democracy\, often called the “fourth pillar” for its role in supporting constitutional values. Yet today\, trust in the media is eroding amid technological upheaval\, shifting revenue models\, political polarization\, and the powerful rise of social media and artificial intelligence. As these forces reshape how information flows\, can the media still serve as a guardian of our constitutional ideals? And who\, if anyone\, will defend the independence and integrity of the media? \nThis session is the third in the series titled ‘We the People’ to celebrate 75 years of our Constitution. As part of this series\, DAKSH\, in collaboration with BIC\, is organising a series of lectures and panel discussions on various aspects of the Constitution.\nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Descriptive Piano
DESCRIPTION:This is a BIC Elsewhere event at Sabha: An Arts and Crafts Shaale \nSince its origins in the 18th century\, the piano has been used by composers to describe places\, events\, and even to conjure up the sounds of other instruments\, from solo violins to full symphony orchestras. In this introduced ‘conversational’ concert\, Karl Lutchmayer will guide his audience through more than a century of piano music\, exploring the endless versatility of the instrument in bringing real and imagined worlds to life. Along the way\, he will play works by some of the most important piano composers\, including Beethoven\, Liszt and Debussy. \n \nThis is a BIC Elsewhere Event \nWhile the majority of our events find a home at our premises in Domlur\, BIC Elsewhere represents our commitment to bringing conversations\, arts\, and culture directly to diverse audiences. Through this initiative\, we collaborate with various venues\, extending the reach of our events beyond our own space. These partnerships not only breathe life into our gatherings but also play a crucial role in cultivating an environment for the flourishing of arts and culture in the city. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Universal Food Security
DESCRIPTION:Imagine a world without hunger and malnutrition. What would it take to achieve a genuinely food-secure world—where every person gets to consume the right quantity and quality of food to live a healthy\, active\, and productive life? \nAchieving and sustaining such a future requires transforming how our food is grown\, managed\, distributed\, and consumed. From production to consumption\, our food systems must be more sustainable\, halting environmental degradation\, and even repairing the damage we have previously done. \nGlenn Denning’s Universal Food Security: How to End Hunger While Protecting the Planet presents a bold\, evidence-based\, practical guide to food systems transformation. He bridges the divisive worlds of science\, policy\, and practice. By synthesizing the most relevant literature\, consulting the world’s foremost experts\, and sharing personal insights gained over four decades\, Denning lays out five priority areas for action and investment. \nBut in Universal Food Security\, Denning goes beyond what needs to change. He goes on to tackle the challenges of implementation. Echoing the words of his mentor\, the late Professor MS Swaminathan\, Denning argues that we need the knowhow and the do-how to transform our food systems.  \nUniversal Food Security calls for a new generation of enlightened practitioner-leaders—acting on their own and with others\, through institutions—to achieve a food-secure world. \nImage Captions:\nThumbnail\, Poster and Header: Rice crops in Cambodia\nInstastory: Maize crops in Malawi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n
