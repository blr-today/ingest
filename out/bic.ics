SUMMARY:Romantic Ties — Liszt\, Brahms\, Sciortino
DESCRIPTION:Award-winning Italian pianist Elia Cecino presents a programme that evokes the interactions of thought among composers and the web of similarities and quotations woven into their music. Meet the figures who inspired the works of the great nineteenth-century Romantic composers\, Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms.  \nElia Cecino will perform Liszt exploring the theme of love in the opera “Faust” by Charles Gounod\, with the love duet between Faust and Margherita\, and in the passionate verses of the Italian poet Francesco Petrarca. Alongside\, in an experimental comparison\, Cecino will premier in India the “New Petrarca Sonnet” (2022) by the contemporary composer Orazio Sciortino.  \nCecino will also play Brahms’ Variations Op. 9 paying homage to Clara and Robert Schumann\, in a meditative atmosphere of memories and allusions. The grandiose Sonata Op. 1\, reminiscent of Beethoven’s style\, will close the concert with a sparkle. \n \n\nIn collaboration with: \n      \nSupported by: \n             \n

SUMMARY:Vara Narada
DESCRIPTION:Typically considered to be a mischief maker\, the role of Narada has often been reduced to that of jest\, featuring as a comic relief in mythological stories. However\, there is far more depth to his character\, as evident in Sanskrit and regional literature. \nHe is a guru\, a well wisher and a soul that helps devotees in distress and more. His persona far surpasses the stereotypes that surround him\, and this production by Madrasana aims to highlight that. Presented by Vinay Varanasi & Aditya Madhavan\, Vara Narada pays homage to lesser known aspects of the bard through stories and music. The program aims to unravel the layers behind the character\, while traversing through stories and supporting music. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Towards Digital Film Societies
DESCRIPTION:Two years of Covid witnessed the world going digital in a big way. The analogue era’s cultural movements like film societies too underwent major changes. Many used digital platforms to see and discuss films in their quest towards building a better film culture. \nAfter starting as the only forum for savouring world film classics in 1940s Mumbai\, today the film society movement is finding itself in the midst of a complete digital makeover after two decades of struggling with digital formats from VHS tapes to OTT. Will these changes help them achieve their original goal of developing a group of film connoisseurs and professionals who will carry on the mantle of meaningful films? To know the future one needs to understand the history and its dynamics in full measure. \nBased on the book Celluloid to Digital: India’s Film Society Movement by V K Cherian\, this session will begin with a talk examining the future course of the Indian film society movement which nourished the ‘New Wave’ in Indian films from 1970 and has been an anchor for all the meaningful films in the country. It will be followed by a discussion with Babu Subramanian and a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Beyond the Red Nose
DESCRIPTION:Clowning as an art form allows one to be their most vulnerable self with the freedom to express all kinds of emotions in a light\, joyous way. It is both a therapeutic experience as well as a learning experience. Clowning uses strategies like honesty\, simplicity\, connection\, respect and honour wrapped in humour and joy to help participants find their inner child. \nWhen applied in a healthcare system or any place where people are frustrated\, anxious or experiencing shame and hopelessness\, it becomes a very effective medium to express all kinds of emotions which are otherwise suppressed. It helps unlock a therapeutic effect not only for the people in such setups but also for the people who go in as clowns. \nThis session will involve lots of games\, partner work\, imagination\, voice and body work. \nNote: Participants are requested to wear loose and comfortable clothing to the workshop as there will be moderately intense physical work. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:Like the Date Palm
DESCRIPTION:“Translation is a little like falling in love\,” says Arvind Krishna Mehrotra. “It can be love at first sight\, when you read a poet and have a desire to translate him immediately. Or he can come back to you decades later\, your memory of him faded. When I started translating Rahim’s dohas\, I had forgotten all about him\, even who he was. It’s as if I’d never read him – though I had.” \nIn Search of Rahim is Mehrotra’s discovery of the man and his work through translation\, history\, and memory. In the process\, he recovers parts of his own boyhood by going back to someone who died 400 years ago. \nThis event has Mehrotra in conversation with Jeet Thayil. Post the conversation the floor will be open for a Q&A with the audience. \nHeader Image: Akbar’s siege of “Brampore” (Burhanpur); from the last German edition of *Munster’s Cosmographia*\, 1628 \n

SUMMARY:Tara's Trio
DESCRIPTION:English | 85 Mins | For Ages 5 to 13 Years \nTara is nine years old and lives with her parents. Little does she know that there are three other companions Andro (Technology)\, Wadeva (Boredom) and Imagenie (Imagination) who also live with her. These three love Tara very much and are constantly competing with each other to get her attention. Her Dad loves his gadgets and her Mom tries to keep everyone’s imagination alive. \nIt’s summer break and they are off to visit Nani. The rest of the play is about the crazy adventure they end up having. Their car breaks down near a forest. A con man ‘Baba Black Sheep Singh’ appears and offers to help. He hypnotizes the parents and starts to loot the car. At first Tara is scared but as things get more complicated\, she realizes that she will have to do something. Turns out the three secret companions are more than happy to jump in. They help Tara to come up with an explosive plan to scare the baba and bring him to his knees. \nDirectors’ Note: \nEverything is fine in equal measure\,\nFinding a balance is finding treasure\,\nNothing is good or bad ifs all your perception\,\nBut watch out beware don’t be fooled by deception \nWith everything in moderation\,\nWe can be a happy nation\,\nTechnology\, Imagination\,\nAnd even Boredom. \nThe play explores the basic idea and importance of technology\, boredom imagination in daily life of a child. In big cities\, there is a lack of space for children to be physically activity\, most schools don’t even have a playground and parents are busy with their lives leaving them with no time for kids. This has led to children also being stuck in their rooms glued to plastic screens. Whatever happened to reading books\, playing those make-believe games or finding inventive ways to pass the time? Apart from reaffirming the need to be imaginative\, the play also tries to change our perception towards Boredom which is mostly seen as negative. \nCast & Crew \nAndro: Jeh Alexandar / Sukrit Mahajan\nWadeva: Kiyomi Mehta / Meghna Roy Chaudhary\nImagenie: Shreya Sharma / Twvinkle Kapoor\nTara: Shristi Sharma / Prarthana Kudtarkar\nMamma: Deepa Panchal\nPapa: Ameet Bhuvan / Danesh Gopalkrishnan\nBaba Black Sheep Singh: Kaustav Sinha\nGPS Voice: Dilnaz Irani\nBig G Voice: Maneesh Verma \nDirection: Kalyani Hiwale & Akhshay Gandhi\nScript\, Lyrics & Music: Asif Ali Beg\nStory: Kalyani Hiwale & Maneesh Verma\nMusic Producer: Kaizad Gherda\nCostumes: Sonal Kharade\nAssistant Director: Vishal\nLights: Vishal & Niranjan Jadhao\nSets & Props: Kapil Dev & Niranjan Jadhao\nStage Manager: Monika Gupta\nPublicity Design: Maneesh Verma\nExecutive Producer: Anita Gandhi\nAssociate Producer: Shimlli Basu\nCreative Producer: Maneesh Verma \nOur Muses: Aadya Verma & Neev Gandhi \nProduced by Collective Madness in collaboration with Conservatory for Arts & Artists\nSupported by Bhasha Centre and Insider under their co-producing initiative – Manch \n

SUMMARY:Chardi Kala
DESCRIPTION:95 mins | Punjabi\, Hindi with English Subtitles | India\nTrigger Warning: Sensitive Content\n \nDirection\, Camera and Editing – Prateek Shekhar\nMusic – Nipun Bhatnagar\nColorist – Divya Kehr\nDrone – Sashawhyy\nMixing Engineer – Abhishek Singh \nIn September 2020\, the Indian government passed three agricultural laws aimed at liberalising the farm economy. Soon after\, farmers from across the country gathered at the borders of India’s national capital\, New Delhi\, for one of the biggest non-violent protests in modern history.  \nExpressing their concerns about the dangers of corporatisation of agriculture\, farmers articulated detailed and nuanced criticism against what they believed were unjust laws. Over the year-long protest\, the farmers slept and cooked on the national highway\, braving extreme weather conditions and hostility from their government\, until the laws were repealed. \nAlong with the strong mobilisation by the farmer unions\, it was the embodiment of Sikh principle of sewa (selfless service for the betterment of society) and the expression chardi kala (eternal optimism) that made the movement dynamic\, unique and strengthened its undying and indomitable spirit. \nInspired by their everyday resilience\, Chardi Kala follows the journey of the farmers’ protest until their victory. The one-person-crew film observes\, listens and documents the farmers’ comprehensive arguments\, their acts of selfless service and the spirit of eternal optimism that imbued this grassroots-led movement as it made history.  \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Echoes of AI
DESCRIPTION:On the surface\, an Indian doctor\, a British poet\, an UberEats courier in Pittsburgh\, and a Chinese activist in exile have nothing in common. But they are in fact linked by a profound common experience―unexpected encounters with artificial intelligence. In her debut book Code Dependent\, shortlisted for the inaugural Women’s Prize for Non-fiction 2024\, Madhumita Murgia shows how automated systems are reshaping our lives all over the world\, from technology that marks children as future criminals\, to an app that is helping to offer medical diagnoses to a remote tribal community. \nBy highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley\, Madhumita explores the impact of this often-exploitative technology on individuals\, communities\, and our wider society. \nVidushi Marda\, a lawyer and researcher\, specialises in examining the socio-legal ramifications of data-driven technologies. Her research centers on technology regulation\, asymmetric power dynamics\, and fundamental rights. Through her endeavors\, she collaborates with governments\, corporations\, and technical communities to promote social justice. \nTogether\, they will discuss and unpack how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency\, and shatter our illusion of free will. AI has already infiltrated our day-to-day\, through language-generating chatbots like ChatGPT and social media. But it’s also affecting us in more insidious ways. It touches everything from our interpersonal relationships\, to our kids’ education\, work\, finances\, public services\, and even our human rights. It is already changing what it means to be human\, in ways large and small\, and Madhumita and Vidushi reveal what could happen if we fail to reclaim our humanity. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Asamana Anasuya
DESCRIPTION:92 Minutes 36 Seconds | English & Telugu with English Subtitles | 2023 \nAsamana Anasuya (Incomparable Anasuya)\, is a documentary directed by Seetha Ratnakar as a tribute to her mother Vinjamuri Anasuya Devi.  \nVinjamuri Anasuya Devi was a musical prodigy who started giving concerts at the age of 7. Her first gramophone recording\, Ayyo Koyyoda at age 8\, ignited her lifelong love affair with folk music. She was a trailblazer who introduced folk songs on a concert platform when she was 11. Encouraged by the overwhelming response she started giving full length folk concerts along with her sister\, Vinjamuri Seetha Devi. Popularly known as the Vinjamuri Sisters\, they became a phenomenon that took the music world by storm.  \nAnasuya started composing music for her uncle\, Devulapalli Krishna Sastri when she was 9 and became a sought-after music composer.

She bequeathed an invaluable legacy to posterity by categorising her vast collection into 7 volumes and publishing them along with lyrics and music notations. At the age of 80\, Anasuya became a writer and published 4 books including her autobiography Asamana Anasuya\, at the age of 94.  \nThe film screening will be followed by a Q&A with the director. \n

SUMMARY:Main Tawaif
DESCRIPTION:Main Tawaif is a presentation by Manjari Chaturvedi\, under The Courtesan Project Series. 15 years in existence\, the series is founded and conceptualised by Classical Dancer\, Creator of Sufi Kathak\, and Restorer of the Dance of Tawaifs\, Manjari Chaturvedi. The Courtesan Project has become one of the most successful dance revival movements in today’s time. Giving a voice to the women and 100s of years of creative contribution to theatre\, cinema and performing arts. \nThis performance is an exploration of the gender dynamics within the arts\, unveiling the pivotal influence of women performers – the enigmatic Tawaifs and Baijis – of North India from the 16th to the 20th century. The performance is set as an intimate mehfil performance of how the Tawaifs would perform in yesteryears. Their music\, their stories\, their dance enacted by a single performer. \nThis is a bold statement that is needed to finally accord respect for the performance art of the Tawaif\, to go beyond the drawing room sniggers and laughter associated with the word Tawaif\, and to finally acknowledge their role in history. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Rise and Fall of the Vanderbilts
DESCRIPTION:Once upon a time\, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations\, the wealth-worth billions in today’s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change – the emotional and the rational – and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business\, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture\, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change—something prevalent in today’s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away. The authors will share their insight on how it’s imperative to draw lessons from the past\, navigate the present\, and prepare for the future. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n
