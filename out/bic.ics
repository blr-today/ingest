SUMMARY:Homecoming
DESCRIPTION:Conversations around mental health often remain confined to whispers\, held back by silence\, stigma\, and fear. Yet when lived experiences are shared\, they open windows into understanding\, empathy\, and change. This session reflects on how personal storytelling can transform pain into purpose\, inviting us to see resilience and healing in new\, deeply human ways. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeaturing Neha Kirpal and Dr. Nandini Murali\, co-authors of Homecoming: Mental Health Journeys of Resilience\, Healing and Wholeness\, Westland Books and the India Mental Health Alliance bring to you a discussion featuring seven participants\, the two co-authors and five contributors\, bringing together voices of women from across urban India navigating a wide spectrum of mental health conditions. Through their journeys\, marked by courage\, vulnerability\, and renewal\, they challenge the idea of brokenness and reimagine what it means to be whole.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe session will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresented by: \n          \n \n

SUMMARY:Tat Tvam Asi - Finding Thyself
DESCRIPTION:Tat-Tvam Asi is a meditative dance production that explores the essence of surrender as a path to self-realisation\, through the lives of Andal\, Radha\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu—each a yogi in their own right. Drawing from the Bhagavad Gita\, where Krishna says\, “As all surrender unto Me\, I reward them accordingly\, ” this work reflects the multiple ways one can find the divine: through devotion\, knowledge\, or selfless action. The production unfolds as a series of  vignettes—Andal’s karmic service\, Radha’s longing rooted in bhakti\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s ecstatic sankeertana—interwoven with Krishna ’s own voice as the sutradhar (narrator). From the chariot of Jagannatha in Puri to the quiet sanctum of a temple\, the narrative reveals the beauty of total surrender\, dissolving the ego in divine love. Blending classical dance traditions such as Bharatnatyam and Gaudiya Nritya with original music and poetic texts\, Tat-Tvam Asi is a journey into Krishna Tattvam—the omnipresence of the divine within and around us. \nThe depth of this timeless message and wisdom (familiar to many Vedantic scholars and Indians) was explored by Neha through the many coloured hues of devotion (bhakti) found in ancient lores and cultures. Neha chose the beloved pastoral God Krishna as the focus of bhakti of the devotee. Neha’s approach to Tat Tvam Asi is episodic. Fragments from Andal\, Radha and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were revisited and evoked with compelling conviction through her intense abhinaya. Neha Mondal has conceptualized Tat-Tvam Asi after years of deep reflection on the nature of devotion and surrender. Her creative process involved studying scriptures\, poetry\, and the lives of Andal\, Radha\, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to understand their spiritual journeys. She collaborated closely with scholars\, musicians\, and writers to shape a narrative that is both intimate and universal. As a dancer rooted in tradition yet open to exploration\, Neha wove together movement\, music\, and storytelling to evoke the transformative power of bhakti. This production is a culmination of her artistic introspection and spiritual inquiry\, brought to life through dance. \nCredits \nConcept & Choreography: Neha Mondal \nScript: Smt.

SUMMARY:Damaru - Duality
DESCRIPTION:The Damaru\, as an instrument\, manifests the flow of energy between Purusha and Prakriti through its very shape. In it is contained the origin of sound; sound that is the genesis of creation and movement. Conceptualized and choreographed by Vidhya Subramanian\, the work brings together an ensemble of eight dancers – Vidhya Subramanian\, Anu Bhaskararaman\, Anisha Parameswaran\, Archa Shajukumar\, Manasa Vijaychander\, Pranathi Ramadorai\, Sandhya Venkiteshwaram and Subashree S. DAMARU highlights the dualities present within us as well as in the universe—sound and silence\, stillness and movement\, creation and dissolution\, male and female\, self and other\, union and separation – in each of us exists the duality that the universe holds.  \nChoreographed and directed by Vidhya Subramanian\, Damaru is Sparsha Dance Ensemble’s first ensemble work and has received excellent audience feedback. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Shobane Pāḍa
DESCRIPTION:Step into the lyrical world of Shobane Pāḍa\, the tender\, devotional songs that accompany the milestones of a woman’s life in Karnataka’s folk tradition. Sung during auspicious occasions such as marriage\, childbirth\, and festivals\, these songs celebrate womanhood in all its beauty and grace\, blending melody\, poetry\, and emotion into a timeless cultural expression. \nIn this edition of BIC Janapada\, audiences will experience Shobane Pāḍa through two distinct regional lenses\, from the soulful verses of Pattalamma Janapada Kala Sangha\, led by Krishne Gowda from Mandya in Southern Karnataka\, to the earthy\, resonant tunes of GK Kala Vedika from North Karnataka. Together\, they offer a rare glimpse into how different communities express shared emotions through diverse musical idioms and dialects. \nThrough live renditions and storytelling\, the session explores the social and cultural significance of Shobane\, how these songs serve as a collective blessing\, a space for women to voice joy\, longing\, and devotion. The audience will be invited to experience the changing rhythms and tones that mark life’s transitions\, from the playful to the profound. \nMore than just performance\, this is a celebration of continuity \,of how music has always been a vessel for community\, emotion\, and identity in Karnataka’s living traditions. \nThis is the fifth performance of our series BIC Jaanapada. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka’s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India\, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression. Through demonstrations\, performances\, and academic discussions\, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Dancing on Walls
DESCRIPTION:Works of art are good things to think about. They awaken our senses\, invite interpretation\, and spark curiosity.

SUMMARY:Judge and Be Judged: Musings on the Top Court

SUMMARY:Asymptomatic
DESCRIPTION:\nHave you asked yourself “why me?” \nHave you found yourself sitting in a corner\, looking at the stakes piled up against you\, and felt them to be unnavigable\, and more than that\, just plain unfair? \nA solo performance\, Asymptomatic\, is a sharp and humorous take on the power systems that largely govern who will succeed and who will not. \nThe piece tells the story of an artist hungry for success and rebuffed at every turn. What happens to a person who needs to constantly prove themselves\, prove their worth? \nSupported by: \n \n\n
