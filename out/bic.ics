SUMMARY:Abu’s World
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: Friday\, 23 August 6:30 pm\nTimings: 10 am to 8 pm\nExhibition on show until Monday\, 26 August \nWalkthroughs with the Curator:\nFriday 23 August\, 6:45 pm\nSaturday\, 24 August\, 11:30 am and 6:00 pm\nSunday\, 25 August\, 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm\nMonday\, 26 August\, 6:30 pm \nPanel Discussion: Sunday\, 25 August\, 11:00 am \nIt has been almost 22 years since Abu Abraham’s acerbic pen was laid to rest in his home state of Kerala. But the magnificent oeuvre of this renowned Thiruvalla-born cartoonist\, artist\, journalist\, and author will endure.  \nIn his nearly six-decade career\, from the late 1940s to the early 2000s\, with some of the leading publications in India and England\, Abu captured the zeitgeist of those turbulent times in his prodigious output that comprised political cartoons\, illustrations for newspaper columns\, caricatures\, comic strips\, impressionist sketches\, travel drawings\, portraits\, and even an animation film titled No Arks. \nOn display are cartoons\, sketches\, and notebooks\, including some that have never been seen in public before. These works also chronicle his extensive travels all over the world\, his presence at momentous events\, and his meetings with the famous personalities of those times. Abu’s career peaked in the 1970s after he returned to India from England. From his vantage point in the national capital\, he was able to dissect major events like the Bangladesh War and the Emergency with his biting wit that never shied away from speaking truth to power. Not surprisingly\, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\, who was at the centre of most political developments\, figured prominently in his cartoons\, as did the national and regional leaders who were in opposition to her\, including those from her own party. \nThis centenary exhibition provides a glimpse into Abu’s large body of work\, evoking his versatility as an artist and the spirit with which he lived his life. True to the ethos of political satire\, he does not spare anyone! The exhibition has travelled to Kochi and Kolkata and will go to New Delhi after this show in Bangalore. Don’t miss it! \nOn Sunday\, August 25\, 2024 at 11 am\, as part of the exhibition “Abu’s World\,” there will be a panel discussion featuring cartoonists\, journalists\, and a historian. They will explore the impact and significance of Abu Abraham’s work in their respective fields and its relevance in contemporary times. \nThis exhibition was supported by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi. \n(Text courtesy: Ayisha and Janaki Abraham\, Mario Rodriguez\, Siddharth Shivakumar\, Prateeti Punja Ballal) \n

SUMMARY:Beyond Story
DESCRIPTION:Friday | Aug 23 | 6:30 pm onwards\nSaturday | Aug 24 | 10:30 am onwards\nSunday | Aug 25 | 10:30 am onwards \nStories dominate our lives\, whether in books\, films\, religion or politics. Ideas and thoughts seem to become palatable only when they are contained within stories with strong characters and tightly woven plots. Of late\, even non-fiction filmmakers tend towards single-character narratives\, with clearly defined three-act structures. \nBeyond Story explores an alternative – the essay film – over three days of interactive sessions with filmmakers and film scholars. \nSchedule: \n\n\n\n\nFriday | Aug 23\nSaturday | Aug 24\nSunday | Aug 25\n\n\n10:30 am\n\nScreening: \nNight and Fog\nby Alain Resnais\n1956 | 32 mins \nLa Jetée\nby Chris Marker\n1962 | 28 mins\nScreening: \nLooking for Horses \nby Stefan Pavlovic\n2021 | 88 mins\n\n\n12:15 pm\n\nTalk: \nDigital Afterlives of Films\nChloé Galibert-Laîné\nRitika Kaushik\nTalk: \nEat your Mother and Father\nYashaswini Raghunandan \n \n\n\n02:30pm\n\nTalk: \nThe making of an Essay Film – Impetus and Discovery\nSameera Jain\nTalk: \nNon-Narratives with Conceptual Extensions\nVasanthi Mariadass \n \n\n\n04:30 pm\n\nScreening: \nI Am Yet to See Delhi \nby Humaira Bilkis\n2014 | 19 mins \nJamnapaar\nby Abhinava Bhattacharyya\n2017 | 24 mins \nChadariya\nby Nimisha Srivastava\n2022 | 25 mins \n(Films from the Creative Documentary Course\, SACAC\, New Delhi)\\nTalk: \nEssay Film and the Voice\nMathew Barrington \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n06:30 pm\nTalk: \nImage and Sound as Text\nAvijit Mukul Kishore \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \nScreening: \nTales from Planet Kolkata by Ruchir Joshi\n1993 | 38 mins\nFollowed by a discussion with the Director. \n  \n  \n \nScreening: \nNight and Fear (Raati O Bhaya) by Lipika Singh Darai\n2023 | 28 mins\nFollowed by Q&A with the Director. \nLetter From Your Far-off Country by Suneil Sanzgiri\n2020 | 17 mins \nGolden Jubilee by Suneil Sanzgiri\n2021 | 19 mins\n\n\n\nDay 1\n23 August | Friday \n6:30 pm\nImage and Sound as Text\nA Talk by Avijit Mukul Kishore\nFilm is a temporal art form that employs multiple registers of image\, sound\, music and memory to make meaning. This talk will feature in-depth analysis of short films and excerpts from longer essay films in different genres that include actuality\, observational documentary\, found-footage film and autobiography\, to look at the complex ways in which film’s formal elements come together to create meaning while drawing on our lived experience. \nDay 2\n24 August | Saturday \n10:30 am\nScreening: Night and Fog\nAlain Resnais | 1956 | 32 mins\nThis poignant and harrowing documentary reflects on the horrors of Nazi concentration camps\, blending historical footage with contemporary observations to evoke the stark reality of genocide and the importance of remembering its lessons. \nScreening: La Jetée\nChris Marker | 1962 | 28 mins\nIn a post-apocalyptic future\, a man is sent back in time to explore the past and find a way to save humanity\, but his journey leads him to an unexpected and haunting conclusion. This innovative sci-fi short film is told almost entirely through still photographs.\n \n12:15 pm\nDigital Afterlives of Films\nTalks by Chloé Galibert-Laîné and Ritika Kaushik\nChloé Galibert-Laîné: In this deeply personal video diary\, a young researcher tries to make sense of her fascination for the film “The Pain of Others” by Penny Lane. A deep dive into the discomforting world of YouTube and online conspiracies\, that challenges traditional notions of what documentary cinema is or should be.\nRitika Kaushik: Ritika Kaushik will consider the video essay as a form for examining the digital afterlives of films from the past. Kaushik’s talk will take us through her formal experiments with online and desktop interactions and how they can enliven archival and contemporary digital materials to bring out new configurations of film historiography. She will specifically discuss the ‘reaction video’ as an essayistic technique for creating an embodied and affective engagement with pre-existing audiovisual media. \n2:30 pm\nThe making of an Essay Film – Impetus and Discovery\nA Talk by Sameera Jain\nStemming from a practitioner’s perspective\, the session looks at some recent short films and traces their journeys of making. We find that the form appears through a search for a relationship with image\, sound\, time\, meaning and affect\, a pursuit that is not governed by existing formulations\, but by the creative processes in practice. The talk will attempt to unpack phases in these navigations and present how the cinema essay is ‘found’\, reflecting on the openness\, expanse\, fluidity and inclusivity of the form. In addition\, referencing contemporary and historical cinema\, we explore facets of the essay film\, walking through with some examples. \n4:30 pm\nScreening: Films from the Creative Documentary Course\, SACAC\, New Delhi\n• I Am Yet to See Delhi by Humaira Bilkis | 2014 | 19 mins\n• Jamnapaar by Abhinava Bhattacharyya | 2017 | 24 mins\n• Chadariya by Nimisha Srivastava | 2022 | 25 mins \n6:30 pm\nScreening: Tales from Planet Kolkata\nRuchir Joshi | 1993 | 38 mins\nTales from Planet Kolkata anticipates the period Calcutta was approaching in the early 90s: the wasteland of violent traffic\, the orgy of rampant construction\, the severing of old traditions\, the rise of cynical politics\, the strange\, once again subservient relationship with the west. Seeing it today\, it’s startling how much of it still resonates with the city Calcutta/Kolkata has become. Part fiction\, part spoof\, part essay\, part documentary\, the film weaves together disparate strands: a critique of Western media’s construction\, from the 1960s to the 1990s; of Calcutta as ‘the black hole’ and ‘the worst place in the world’; an ‘elegy’ to Deepak Majumdar\, one of  Calcutta’s great intellectual mavericks\, a teacher and friend to Joshi and many others\, who died while the film was being made; and the images and song of a patua – a traditional Bengali scroll-painter. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by a discussion with the director\, Ruchir Joshi. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \nDay 3\n25 August | Sunday \n10:30 am\nScreening: Looking for Horses\nStefan Pavlovic | 2021 | 88 mins\nTravelling to Bosnia in search of his origins\, filmmaker Stefan Pavlović meets a solitary fisherman. One man has language impairment\, the other lost his hearing during the war. Camera in hand\, the director films the onset of this improbable and profound friendship. \n12:15 pm\nEat your Mother and Father\nA Talk by Yashaswini Raghunandan\nIn this session we will look at how filmmakers weave in their families and themselves to expand the conversations around identity\, alienation and political histories. Through the films ‘Looking for Horses’ by Stefan Pavlovic\, ‘Will you look at me?’ by Shuli Huang and ‘A picture of you’ by Ajay Naronha\, we will look at how the essay is constructed through the making of the film\, revealing an intimate side of filmmaking. All three filmmakers use filmmaking as a method to ask difficult questions and to re-connect\, allowing for some form of catharsis. \n2:30 pm\nEssay Film and the Voice\nA Talk by Matthew Barrington\nIn this session we explore the complexities of voice as both a narrative device and a vehicle for personal expression\, as we examine its transformative power in shaping cinematic discourse. From subjective introspection to objective analysis\, we unpack how the voice navigates the intricate intersections of truth\, perspective\, and interpretation within the essay film landscape. The voice as subjective – departing from a dominant\, authoritative narrator. \n4:30 pm\nNon-Narratives with Conceptual Extensions\nA Talk by Vasanthi Mariadass\nVisual essays are noted for non-narrative style. A re-editing to re-narrate stories untold or less told. I engage with works by Ursula Biemann\, and Harun Farocki\, to examine their theoretical insertions through the visual form.  I would not just call them visual essays but an unfolding of visual theory.  Images collide or they are quietly juxtaposed\, despite the events and topics coming from different spaces\, times\, and seemingly unrelated topics/images\, hence refreshing found images and concepts. Conceptual works by Biemann relate to Environmental concerns and Farocki’s concept examines an already established idea such as the enlightenment but rethinks and retells other not-so-visible concepts such as perfection and precision that silently negotiate the development of scientific and technological production. \n6:30 pm\nScreening: Night and Fear (Raati O Bhaya)\nLipika Singh Darai | 2023 | 28 mins\nThe residuals of recorded material generated by the filmmaker over a decade of filmmaking practice\, with the passing of time\, have acquired new meaning. With a range of experiences – from a local witch hunt to a meeting with a stunning waterfall – the past\, the present\, the fear and the intuitive self\, have found shelter in the characters and spaces from the world captured through image and sound which have aged just enough to correlate and run a parallel narrative. Having a twofold interior\, Night and Fear is a personal essay addressed to the filmmaker’s late grand aunt\, but also a reflection on the impact of making films – on the filmmaker herself and the society. \nThe screening of the film will be followed by Q&A with the Director. \nScreening: Letter From Your Far-Off Country\nSuneil Sanzgiri | 2020 | 18 mins\nShot with 16mm film stock that expired in 2002—the same year as the state-sponsored anti-Muslim genocide in Gujarat—and filmed amid the anti-CAA protests in Delhi\, the filmmaker traces lines and lineages of ancestral memory\, poetry\, history\, songs\, and ruins from his birth in 1989. \nScreening: Golden Jubilee\nSuneil Sanzgiri | 2021 | 19 mins\nWhat is liberation when so much has already been taken? Who has come for more? ‘Golden Jubilee’\, takes as its starting point scenes of the filmmaker’s father navigating a virtual rendering of their ancestral home in Goa\, India\, created using the same technologies of surveillance that mining companies use to map locations for iron ore in the region. A tool for extraction and exploitation becomes a method for preservation. The father\, sparked by a memory of an encounter as a child\, inhabits the voice of a spirit known locally as Devchar\, whose task is to protect the workers\, farmers\, and the once communal lands of Goa. Protection from what the filmmaker asks. \nIn collaboration with: \n          \n  \n

SUMMARY:ಬಾಬ್ ಮಾರ್ಲಿ ಫ್ರಮ್ ಕೋಡಿಹಳ್ಳಿ  | Bob Marley from Kodihalli

The play is set in an urban context. Three characters trying to make a living in Bangalore are forced to leave their house because of their identities. An intimate conversation happens between those three as it is the last night that they are staying there\, which reveals the depths of their inner selves to each other. \n\n\n\nFor some\, ‘identity’ is a source of pride\, while for others\, it’s a source of disgust\, violence\, and a lifelong burden to carry. Many times\, ‘survival’ seems to involve concealing one’s identities\, flowing and lightening oneself\, only to find that the path doesn’t lead anywhere\, leading to exhaustion. Yet\, exhaustion isn’t reason enough to give up the desire to soar. In the dark path\, one must cling to life for the fireflies. Then\, darkness becomes a celebration\, light becomes a celebration. \nBob Marley from Kodihalli is a collection of narratives that confront the many complex paradoxes surrounding identity. Here\, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s ‘Waiting for a Visa’ becomes a metaphor\, raising the crucial question: where is he really seeking admission? \nThis play explores the intricacies of identity\, the struggles of concealment for survival\, and the persistent hope symbolized by fireflies in darkness. It uses Ambedkar’s work as a central theme to question the nature of acceptance and inclusion in society. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTextual Inspiration: N K Hanumanthaiah\, Chandrashekara K\nWriting\, Design and Direction: Lakshman KP\nDramaturgy: VL Narasimhamurthy\nPerformance text design and Acting: Mariyamma Chudi\, Chandrashekar K\, Shwetha Rani HK\, Bharath Dingri\nLighting Design: Manju Narayan\nLights Execution: Sachin\nProduced by Nirdigantha\nA Jangama Collective Offering \n  \n                        \n  \nSupported by \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:सिल्वटें | Silvatein
DESCRIPTION:90 minutes | Hindi | Suitable for 16 years+\n\nOn a day unknown\, at a place not known\, two people run into one another. They soon start talking to each other\, but they seem to be conversing at cross purposes. They seem to be long-lost lovers but\, at the same time\, seem to be perfect strangers. They seem to have had a life together but\, at the same time\, seem to have had lives apart. They seem to occupy differing realities but simultaneously seem to be in someone’s dream. Who are they? Where are they? Are they actually strangers? Or do they indeed know each other? Is this even real?\nOr is it only someone’s imagination? \nDirector’s Note:  \nThe experience of writing this play\, and now producing and directing it for the stage\, have been cathartic and instrumental in helping me emerge from a difficult year. I am now eager to see how audiences respond to this attempt by our merry band of artists to tell a story from all our lives. I am absolutely swept with the power of community as I see how the cast and crew has worked relentlessly to bring Silvatein on stage\, amidst laughter\, excitement and pure joy of working together. It is a prime example of the passion\, honesty and commitment that brings forward a story about two individuals caught in a web of lies or deceit or it something completely imaginative. This play is intensely special to me\, not only because I have written and directed it but also because the themes and characters are inspired from real life and real incidents that will provoke the audience to reflect on their own experiences. Silvatein is a piece of writing that managed to paint a picture of a world of intimate details that devastates Rupali and Arijit and somehow manages to be bite sized. The characters are delightfully complex and multifaceted and the story feels comfortingly familiar. \nCredit List: \nSet Design: Puneet Gupta and Prachi Kalra\nLight Design: Srinivas Beesetty\,\nPoster Design: Sweta Garg\nProduction Manager: Archana Kariappa and Sandeep Jain\nWritten and Directed by: Shatarupa Bhattacharyya\nCast: Ujani Ghosh and Sagnik Sinha \nSupported by \n \n

SUMMARY:Rhythms of the Desert
DESCRIPTION:Langa and Manganiyar musicians of Rajasthan are a hereditary community of professional musicians from the villages of Barmer\, Balotra\, Jodhpur\, Phalodi and Jaisalmer in the desert areas of western Rajasthan. They have a vast repertoire of folk music integral to their way of life and social systems. Their music\, which has been preserved and passed down through generations\, acts as a medium of information and storytelling\, much like the postcards in your exhibition. \nThe Manganiars’ music has survived for decades thanks to the traditional Jajmani (patronage) system\, which supports their art form and livelihood. Their music has continued to survive for decades mainly because of the Jajmani (patronage) system\, which is fundamental to their art form as well as the source of traditional livelihood. These traditional patrons have been supporting the economy of the communities of Langa and Manganiyar musicians for generations. \nAn eight-member team led by Sardar Khan Langa & Sawai Khan Manganiyar will present traditional folk music of Rajasthan along with Kalbeliya song & dance. Sardar Khan is a senior Langa guru\, a very knowledgeable person of Barnawa Jageer\, and has traveled worldwide to present traditional folk music. Sawai is a young Khartal player of Barna Jaisalmer who has collaborated with various world music maestros. The other members of the team consist of Deu Khan in vocals\, Sikander Khan in Sindhi Sarangi & Algoza\, and Goram Khan in Dholak. This music group will be accompanied by a three-member Kalbelia team including two dancers and one musician. \nIn collaboration with: \n      \n

SUMMARY:Inside India’s Red Corridor
DESCRIPTION:The Red Corridor remains one of the most complex and challenging areas in India\, marred by Naxal-State conflict\, that has been shaping the lives of its residents for over half a century. In the years of reporting from the conflict zone of Bastar\, journalist Ashutosh Bhardwaj pieced together The Death Script: Dreams and Delusions in Naxal Country. \nIn this session\, Ashutosh will shed light on his experience in the conflict zone – reporting on the Maoist\, the state atrocities\, the plight of the Adivasis caught in the civil war and what it means to live through and write about these experiences as a journalist and a bilingual writer. He will talk about deviating from the traditional form of journalistic writing into more creative ones and the crossroads where these forms converge and diverge. The talk will also offer insights into the status of the Hindi media\, its role in shaping the Hindi belt polity\, and the urgent need to focus on and invest in this media section. \nAshutosh Bhardwaj will be in conversation with Kannada author Vasudhendra followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Musical Ecologies
DESCRIPTION:What is nature? Though it is a term used so ubiquitously\, its meaning has been debated and questioned\, changing with each era. While trees\, animals and the planets are considered natural elements\, it is the human relationship to nature that concerns us the most. Aren’t humans too part of nature\, rather than external to it? What is the relationship between humans and nature? Is it merely utilitarian\, or is there hope that can it be something more? \nMusical Ecologies is an exploration of how music and art can answer such questions for us\, by showing us how to experience nature as a world of emotion. Hindustani music has a long tradition of celebrating natural beauty and seasons. These compositions capture the subjective human response to nature\, locating humans very much inside the natural ecosystem as co-habitants. Perhaps by relating to nature on its own terms rather than from a position of control or exploitation\, we can contemplate a symbiotic model of living for the future. \nHindustani vocalist Priya Purushothaman presents bandishes and raags that celebrate the environment and its rich ecosystems\, interspersed with commentary addressing these philosophical questions\, suggesting a way of bringing together environmental consciousness and music. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n     \n  \n

SUMMARY:Tango Ports
DESCRIPTION:Puertos de Tango (Tango Ports) aims to revisit lesser-known themes of great Uruguayan authors\, thus keeping wonderful compositions alive. The project includes a special tribute to Astor Piazzolla and the great Uruguayan poet Horacio Ferrer\, evoking much of their creative duo and reinterpreting part of their repertoire inspired by the artists’ homeland\, Uruguay. In this kind of cosmopolitan tango without temporal and spatial boundaries\, some versions in Italian and French are included\, justified in the words of Ramón Pelinski (Argentine ethnomusicologist and composer) who describes tango as a “global metaphor”: a tango with infinite possibilities\, capable of imagining and travelling to other worlds\, without fear that “its entire life is yesterday\, holding it in its past.” \nNatalia Bolani seeks her own interpretation from her perspective as an actor\, resignifying and valuing the chosen texts through contemporary sounds\, mainly appealing to the sound of the piano and the bandoneón\, instruments with strong organic and referential connotations in Rio de la Plata culture. \nThe project intends to attract new audiences to this genre\, as well as to offer a repertoire not usually enjoyed by those more familiar with the music. Its raison d’être is\, ultimately\, the encounter with the emotions\, a meeting where interpretive and sonorous power intermingle in the same waters\, in a kind of cathartic ritual through artistic creation. \nPresented by the Embassy of Uruguay and MLC Estates LLP \n  \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:SpaceAge Solutions
DESCRIPTION:India\, being one of the developing countries in the world\, does face many challenges when it comes to taking up specific developmental projects for the benefit of the people. Natural resources management and societal applications are the biggest areas for India where the Government spends lots of funds for the benefit of its people. \nGovernment spendings of public money in many important areas\, such as\, building rural and urban infrastructure\, programs on land & water conservation\, agriculture\, water\, forests\, energy and many others to ensure sustainable development of all basic needs of the people\, are efforts towards achieving our sustainable developmental goals. This calls for meticulous planning and well-orchestrated implementation and monitoring. \nSpace technology provides many interesting solutions in terms of Earth observation\, communication and GNSS based solutions. The presentation brings out specific areas where such solutions are being provided to the Government using space technology so that the goals of development and governance are met amicably. \nThe talk by Prof. Diwakar will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nThis session is part of the Let’s Talk Climate Change Talk series. \nPresented by: \n \n
