SUMMARY:359. The Land of The Red River & Blue Hills
DESCRIPTION:Crucial battles of World War II fought in India’s northeast; followed soon after by India’s Independence and Partition; had a critical impact on the making of modern Assam. In the three decades following 1947\, the state of Assam underwent massive political turmoil\, geographical instability\, and social and demographic upheaval\, among others. Later\, the truncated state suffered widespread unrest as various groups believed their cultural identity and political leverage were under threat. New social energies and political forces were unleashed and came to the fore. \nThis session draws from Arupjyoti Saikia’s The Quest for Modern Assam: A History\, 1942-2000 exploring the interconnected layers of political\, environmental\, economic\, and cultural processes that shaped the development of Assam since the 1940s.  Arupjyoti Saikia will be in conversation with historian Anjum Hasan deliberating on the  questions which played a key role in the making of modern Assam and also that of the Republic of India. \nIn this episode of BIC Talks\, Arupjyoti Saikia will be in conversation with Anjum Hasan .This is an excerpt from a conversation that took place in the BIC premises in February 2025. \nSubscribe to the BIC Talks Podcast on your favorite podcast app!\nBIC Talks is available everywhere\, including Apple Podcasts\, Spotify\, Google Podcasts\, Castbox\, Overcast\, Audible\, and Amazon Music. \n

SUMMARY:The House Blue
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: Friday\, 9 May\, 6pm \nExhibition Timings: 11am to 8pm \nExhibition on show until: Sunday\, 11 May\, 8pm \nWalkthroughs with the Artist: \nFriday\, 9 May\, 6:30pm\nSaturday\, 10 May\, 6:30pm\nSunday\, 11 May\, 6pm \nShared Memories: Personal Archives as Collective Storytelling (Workshop): Sunday\, 11 May\, 4pm – 5:30pm \nWhat is home? Does a home need to be a physical space that one occupies? Can a place become a person and vice-versa? How does homelessness feel? What would its contours be? What does it mean to migrate\, be displaced\, and to desert? What are the ways in which we engage with loss? \nThe images on display are part of a broader body of work by Mritunjay Kumar\, a documentary photographer and filmmaker. They depict a government quarter\, photographed on the final day of its occupancy by his family. While the images may initially appear to document the ephemeral nature of leaving a house\, the work serves as an enquiry into questions that Mritunjay—and perhaps countless others—continue to ask. \nThis work forms the foundation of a larger\, collaborative piece: The House Blue\, a hybrid of photo exhibition and narrative theatre-style performance\, co-created with Bengaluru-based theatre artist Anish Victor. \nThe accompanying black-and-white images act as a precursor to the main work. They were created during a journey from Mumbai—where Mritunjay lived for over a decade—to his hometown in Jharkhand\, and back again. These two places\, both “home” or home-like to him\, are connected by images made through the windows of trains\, cars\, and buses. They capture moments of reflection on migration\, migrants\, wealth\, and life\, as he encountered them. \nThe House Blue was originally produced by Serendipity Arts Foundation for the Serendipity Arts Festival\, 2024. \nShared Memories: Personal Archives as Collective Storytelling (Workshop) \nA compact\, hands-on workshop exploring how personal photographs and memories can become starting points for broader stories. Through writing\, sharing\, and reinterpretation\, participants reflect on the emotional and collective power of the personal archive. \nRSVP for the workshop here. \n

SUMMARY:Gurudev and Bapu
DESCRIPTION:Gurudev and Bapu explores the extraordinary exchange of letters and ideas between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore\, set against the backdrop of the Indian freedom struggle. Over 25 years\, their correspondence reveals sharp differences on key issues—nationalism\, civil disobedience\, education—but also unwavering respect and affection between the two. \nTheir dialogue reflects a time in India’s history marked by thoughtful disagreement and political maturity—offering insights into how principled dissent and mutual regard can coexist. \nBangalore Little Theatre was honoured to present early performances of the play at places closely associated with Gandhi and Tagore—Sabarmati Ashram\, Santiniketan (Visva Bharati)\, and Thakurbari-Jorasanko (Rabindra Bharati). It has also been staged for the President of India. \nAdapted from the internationally acclaimed production with over 130 performances in India and abroad\, this staging promises a compelling reflection on two great minds and the values that shaped a nation. This performance is a tribute to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore’s enduring legacy\, presented around the time of his birth anniversary. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Raviraag: In the Light of Melody
DESCRIPTION:Commemorating the maestro’s 105th birth anniversary\, this morning concert pays tribute to Pt. Ravi Shankar\, the legendary sitar virtuoso whose artistry bridged tradition and innovation within Hindustani classical music. \nThe performance features vocal interpretations of two ragas conceived by Ravi Shankar—Raga Bairagi and Raga Natbhairav. Originally explored through the sitar\, these ragas will be reimagined in the vocal tradition\, offering a unique insight into their melodic essence. \nBoth morning ragas embody a serene\, meditative spirit\, inviting listeners into a space of peace and reflection. This concert stands as both a homage and a heartfelt musical offering to a musician whose legacy continues to inspire generations. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:The History of Welfare
DESCRIPTION:Welfare guarantees and direct benefit transfers are at the heart of the political marketplace but the longer-term history of welfare in India is surprisingly little known. Making India Work: The Development of Welfare in a Multi-Level Democracy (Cambridge University Press\, 2025) recovers a history that is crucial for understanding the current juncture of welfare politics and political economy in India. Traversing more than a century of welfare development from the late colonial period to the present-day\, the book asks why India has ended up with a small protected formal sector workforce shielded by social security and protection against retrenchment\, and a much larger population that labours informally and does not enjoy such protections. It examines why India’s model of industrialisation failed to provide an engine for mass employment or welfare state development\, and why the focus of policy efforts has shifted over the last fifty years from employment generation to the rise of ‘direct benefits’ which subsidise precarious livelihoods. \nIn this session\, Louise Tillin\, the author of the book\, Anindita Adhikari and Rajendran Narayanan will be in conversation with Arun Thiruvengadam. The discussion will be followed by Q&A with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nThis event is sponsored by the Justice VR Krishna Iyer Chair\, NLS.  \n

SUMMARY:Varshaya Varshaya Varshaya!
DESCRIPTION:Water in various forms – in oceans\, rivers\, lakes\, temple tanks and life-giving rain – has been the subject of numerous musical compositions in our rich aural classical tradition. Poets and composers across the ages have celebrated this precious resource and captured its significance from religious\, philosophical and utilitarian points of view in their great works and compositions. \nWhat profound message using the imagery of a lake did Saint Purandaradasa convey in a ‘Geetam’\, one of the first compositions a child learns? When we water a Tulasi plant\, does it signify anything beyond the obvious? What are the beautiful scenes visualised by Saint Tyagaraja on the banks of the Yamuna and the Cauvery? How did the great composer Sri Muddusvami Dikshithar bring relief to a drought-stricken place? \nThis Carnatic music concert titled ‘Celebrating Water Through Music’ will provide answers to all these questions and more. It will feature several compositions which\, through their lyrics and melody\, draw our attention to water and its paramount importance in our lives. The context and connection of each song to water\, be it a water body or the venerated form of the Divine itself\, will be presented with explanations enhanced with beautiful visuals. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Signs From the Sky
DESCRIPTION:\nThe session builds on Asko Parpola & Iravatham Mahadevan’s extensive works to show that a substantial portion of the IVC seals was a Celestial Omens List with the planet Venus occupying a central role in their astronomy. The study presents the full decipherment of 75 inscriptions and a partial decipherment of 61 inscriptions forming approximately 5% of the total number of inscriptions. \n\n\n\nKey findings demonstrate the exceptional astronomical sophistication of the Harappan civilization\, including: (1) proof that bilingual parallels can effectively decipher the IVC script; (2) evidence that Harappan astronomical knowledge predated Babylonian astronomy by centuries; (3) the first complete decipherment of the Swastika symbol\, revealing its astronomical significance; (4) identification of signs for planetary movements\, conjunctions\, and their associated omens; (5) discovery of Harappan meteorological methods using Venusian astronomy; and (6) a new understanding of the Great Bath Complex as a venue for astronomical rituals. \n\n\nThis work represents a significant breakthrough in understanding the intellectual and religious life of one of the world’s earliest urban civilizations\, revealing their deep engagement with astronomical observation and its application to social and religious practices. Through archaeoastronomical analysis\, the paper reconstructs the probable actual dates of celestial events tracked by the Harappans\, providing empirical validation for the proposed decipherments.\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience.\n\n

SUMMARY:Mānushī – On a Quest
DESCRIPTION:Mānushī – On a Quest traces the spiritual and emotional journeys of four extraordinary women: the elusive River Saraswathi\, the devoted Meerabai\, the yearning mother Devaki\, and the mystic poet Akka Mahadevi. Rooted in literature\, poetry\, and deep personal exploration\, this Bharatanatyam solo presentation is the culmination of over two years of immersive research and creative engagement. \nThe performance opens with the mystical tale of Saraswathi\, inspired by the book The Lost River\, exploring whether the river still flows—physically and spiritually. We then journey with Meerabai\, who seeks her beloved Krishna through soulful bhajans marked by longing\, devotion\, and unanswered questions. Devaki’s poignant voice follows\, reflecting on the joys of motherhood she never fully experienced and her yearning to reclaim lost moments with her son\, Krishna. The production concludes with Akka Mahadevi\, whose powerful Vachanas guide us on a quest for liberation\, echoing the eternal human desire for union and truth. \nEach piece is supported by evocative compositions\, guided by literary scholars\, and brought to life through thoughtful choreography. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Bag Dancing
DESCRIPTION:Bag Dancing\, written by Mike Kenny\, one of England’s foremost playwrights for young audiences\, is directed by Ujwala Rao and produced by Butai. The cast features acclaimed Kannada and English theatre artists B V Shrunga and Surabhi J Herur. \nThe play poignantly follows Imelda\, a homeless woman who carries her life’s memories and stories in bags. Neville\, a young worker at a homeless shelter\, guards his emotions\, burdened by his own past. As their unexpected friendship blossoms\, they begin to share their stories\, creating a meaningful bond between them. \nDirector’s Note: \nBag Dancing is a play that has drawn me in repeatedly. What continues to captivate me is how playwright Mike Kenny thoughtfully and playfully explores powerful themes such as war\, displacement\, and the intersection of mental health and authority—particularly through a lens that resonates with children and young audiences. \nDuring the creative process\, I’ve found the exploration of boxes and borders especially intriguing—who defines them\, who decides their importance\, and how we navigate the spaces they limit. \nThis play presents a unique opportunity for families and schools to engage in meaningful conversations with children\, sparking discussions about complex topics that might otherwise seem too difficult or uncomfortable to address. \nI hope Bag Dancing fosters reflection\, curiosity\, and open dialogue. \nCredits: \nProduction Assistant: Rachana R\nChoreography: Asha Basavaraj \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Equus
DESCRIPTION:Equus derived from the Latin word for ‘Horse’ is a psychological drama that delves deep into the mind’s primal corners. Written in 1973\, the English “whydunit”\, inspired by a real-life incident\, unravels the mystery behind a shocking act of violence; “Seventeen-year-old\, Alan Strang\, blinds four horses with a metal spike\, in a single night”.\nThe story follows Martin Dysart\, a child psychiatrist\, who begins treating Alan\, only to find himself grappling with his inner turmoil. As the investigation unfolds\, Dysart brings to light\, Alan’s religious\, emotional\, and sexual obsession for horses\, which leads him to confront unsettling truths about the nature of normalcy\, worship\, and desire. Consumed by envy of Alan’s raw\, unfiltered passion\, he is forced to confront the suffocating monotony of his own life.\nPlayhouse re-imagines the classic through Jung’s lens of ‘Shadow Self’\, and makes use of the evocative power of shadow theatre to throw light on the darkness that remains hidden. Alan’s intense passion and obsession with horses becomes a powerful metaphor for humanity’s most profound extremes—what we suppress\, what we idolize\, and what ultimately defines our very existence. \nCrafted by Peter Shaffer \nSupported by: \n \n
