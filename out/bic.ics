SUMMARY:Cry Me A River
DESCRIPTION:Finding a solution to the vexatious Cauvery dispute has been a challenge even to the collective wisdom of veteran politicians\, seasoned policy makers\, experts\, and farmers. At times\, it has also tested the strength of India’s federal structure . After bickering among riparian constituents of the Cauvery basin for over a century and exhausting all avenues\, the judiciary\, finally\, had to divide the quantum of water for each of the involved parties. \nIt is against this backdrop that T Ramakrishnan\, a journalist who has been with The Hindu for over 30 years\, and specialises in water issues\, has authored a monograph in English – Cauvery: A Long Winded Dispute\, which has been published by The Hindu Group. \nIn his talk\, Ramakrishnan will give an account of how the dispute has evolved over the years\, especially after the 1924 Agreement between the Madras Presidency and the Princely state of Mysore. Concerned over challenges facing the river on various fronts\, including environmental\, he favours collaboration between the two principal riparian States\, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. \n

SUMMARY:Chance Encounters
DESCRIPTION:A trio of accomplished musicians are coming together for the first time in recital. Bangalore-based baritone Rahul Bharadwaj and Chennai-based countertenor\, Subin Mathai are accompanied by Mumbai-based Steinway artist Nadine Crasto on Piano. \nThe program is an exploration of the interaction between text and harmony in Art song. Chance encounters with poems set in distinct styles led to searches for more such instances. This set of juxtapositions could offer insight into how meaning is conveyed in music. Composers cited include Brahms\, Schumann and Debussy. \nThe duets in various styles from Schumann to Vaughan Williams offer an opportunity to experience arrangements for baritone and countertenor\, an unusual sonority. The piano\, especially in the Art song\, emerges as a collaborative storyteller in its own right. As the third voice in this narrative\, it interprets and amplifies the emotions embedded in the poetry\, providing a foundation for the vocalists to soar. \n \nSupported by: \n   \n

SUMMARY:Longen Folk to Go on Pilgrimage

A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Mandate 2024 and the Future of Our Republic
DESCRIPTION:The mandate of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections was claimed as a victory by both the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). Even though BJP’s brute majority in the Lok Sabha was dented\, the return of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a third consecutive term was portrayed as a stupendous victory by supporters of the BJP. This is notwithstanding the fact that the stability of the NDA government is now dependent on allies who have displayed temperamental behaviour in the past. The INDIA Alliance was also buoyed by the mandate as it increased its numbers substantially. The Indian National Congress\, the leading component of the INDIA bloc\, almost doubled its numbers\, while other key constituents of this disparate coalition robustly challenged the might of the BJP election apparatus. Even though the INDIA bloc could not gain power in Delhi\, its combative fight against the BJP/ NDA was lauded because – as many astute observers pointed out – the 2024 elections were not seen as a level playing ground. \nStarting from this point\, Yogendra Yadav and Dr. Vasu HV will discuss some of the implications of this mandate on the future of India. While Yadav\, who is a well-known political and social activist\, travelled all over the country tracking the election and even accurately called it\, Dr. Vasu played a similar role in Karnataka leading the research on pre-poll surveys that broadly captured the sentiments of the people of the State. Thus\, the two panelists will provide their crucial insights based on their deep and credible engagement with political behaviour at the national and state level. \nCritics of the BJP have sharply and consistently stated that the idea of India has been imperilled in the past 10 years when the saffron party\, buttressed by its parliamentary heft\, meddled with the institutional framework weakening the republican foundations on which our country was founded. Will the gain in the numbers by the political opposition mean that the political discourse in the country\, that had discernibly shifted rightwards over the past decade\, gradually be tugged back to a central pole position that perhaps\, more accurately reflects the civilizational ethos of a diverse and complex country like India? Early signs indicate that the political opposition has been catalysed by the mandate and is rearing to take the BJP/ NDA head on but how will these diverse political actors maintain their cohesion considering that a slew of state elections will take place where they will be pitted against one another? \nPsephologist and Activist\, Yogendra Yadav and Journalist\, Dr. Vasu HV will be in conversation with Journalist\, Vikhar Ahmed. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Immiserised Bharat
DESCRIPTION:In the early 1970s\, India was experiencing severe poverty and hunger due to the great droughts of the previous decade. Although the Green Revolution was starting\, agriculture and rural issues were largely ignored by urban residents and the media. Reports on monsoons\, crops\, and prices were seldom highlighted\, lacking the appeal for widespread attention. Significant studies like those by V M Dandekar and Nilkanth Rath on poverty were published in specialised journals and went unnoticed by the general public. As a result\, rural despair\, evident then as now\, remained hidden from mainstream discussion. \nFast forward to the third decade of the twenty-first century\, and rural India\, or Bharat\, significantly lags behind urban areas in terms of income\, infrastructure\, governance\, education\, and healthcare. This gap has widened\, especially since India’s economic growth accelerated over the last thirty years. Numerous initiatives over the past seven decades by the government\, private sector\, and civil organisations aimed at rural development have had mixed results\, often falling short of expectations. While there have been significant achievements\, they are isolated instances rather than widespread improvements. Additionally\, resource scarcity\, particularly water\, has become a critical issue\, yet remains largely ignored. \nThe pressing challenge is to connect these isolated successes\, despite the difficult conditions\, to create a more prosperous rural landscape. \nJoin us for a lecture by Prof. Shreekant Sambrani\, followed by a Q&A session to delve deeper into these issues and explore potential solutions. \n

SUMMARY:प्रवास | Pravaas
DESCRIPTION:Since the first humans migrated to present-day India 65\,000 years ago\, the pravaas hasn’t stopped. \nWhether seeking greener pastures\, fleeing oppression\, or pursuing economic opportunities\, migrants have moved across districts\, states and countries. Despite different times\, places\, and cultures that separate each wave of migration\, there is much that is shared in a migrant’s experience. \nPravaas – A Migrant’s Tale is a musical telling of a migrant’s journey. Whether it’s a Bihari traveling to Chennai\, a Rajasthani to Bengaluru\, or a Tamilian to Mumbai\, the only certainty in their journey—whether it begins with hope or fear—is its unpredictability. \nJoin us in the musical experience of the migrant’s timeless tale featuring songs in Bengali\, Sanskrit\, Hindi\, Kannada\, Marathi\, Tamil\, Telugu and more. The performance is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of those who seek new horizons. \n

SUMMARY:'STEMinism' and Feminism
DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to be a feminist? And specifically\, what does it mean to be a feminist in science studies? What does it mean to examine science at multiple levels\, using the twin conceptual tools of feminism: gender and patriarchy? Furthermore\, what does it mean to bring in intersectional perspectives to our understanding of science? Using her work on a) developing the field of Feminist Science Studies in India\, b) archiving the gendered experiences of women in science and c) exploring questions about masculinities in science\, Prof. Gita Chadha will present the possibilities of critically reimagining institutional cultures in and around science. \nThis lecture is part of the Obaid Siddiqi Lectures\, Annual lectures delivered by the Obaid Siddiqi Chair in the History and Culture of Science at the Archives at NCBS. \nImage credit: Thumbnail and Header Art by Megha Ramachandra \nIn collaboration with \n     \n

SUMMARY:Patterns in Bhasha
DESCRIPTION:The book The Politics of Modern Indian Language Literature examines various works of literature\, focusing on prose narrative forms such as novels\, short stories\, memoirs and plays. It deals with works by 25 different writers in 14 languages including those from the religious minorities\, marginalised sections and ethnic groups such as those from Kashmir and Manipur\, and also women writers from across India. The thrust of the book is primarily the politics of the writing and the common concerns that surface in the selected works. Since so many languages are covered\, the works are studied in English language translation and important are primarily the concerns and attitudes of the writers as they are revealed in the translated works. \nThe book tries to look beyond the expressed concerns of each writer at covert significations if any. The discussion is expected to shed light on issues pertaining to Indian language literature after 1947\, since this is the first book on the subject to scrutinize it in this way. \nThe author MK Raghavendra will be in conversation with Chiranjiv Singh\, IAS and N Vidyashankar Jois\, both of whom have been highly active culturally in Bengaluru. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n

SUMMARY:Dhrupad Double Bill
DESCRIPTION:Dhrupad is one of the oldest pristine art forms that textures the Indian musical system. Join us for an evening of Dhrupad\, reimagined by two young and talented Dhrupadiyas. \nMurali Mohan Gowda will introduce the basic concepts and techniques of Dhrupad\, specifically related to Dagarbani and Raga music in general. He will cover topics including the basic differences between Dhrupad and other forms of Indian classical music\, the origin of Dhrupad\, the concept of Ragas\, structure and improvisational tools\, and Talas and compositions. \nIn the second part of the concert\, Shilpa Shankar Narrain will explore unique aspects of Muthuswami Dikshitar’s compositions from a Dhrupad perspective.

SUMMARY:The Making of a Campus
DESCRIPTION:The design of the IIM Bangalore (IIMB) campus has evolved through contributions from multiple architects over time\, yet its adaptable built and open spaces seem to have allowed it to develop into a cohesive and integrated entity. The book The Making of a Campus: IIM Bangalore shares how this campus came into being and how it has been experienced over time. Through its pages\, the book reveals the thought processes\, design philosophies\, and the interplay between architecture and community that have contributed to the campus’s continuing appeal and functionality. \nUsing the book as a starting point\, the session will explore how a shared design philosophy has imbued the campus with a sense of timelessness. This project\, conceived and executed by architects Balkrishna Doshi and Achyut Kanvinde with subsequent additions by Sanjay Mohe & Medappa\, stands as a testament to the enduring design. \nThe session will commence with an introduction by the book’s author\, Kiran Keswani\, followed by insights from Bijoy Ramachandran\, who has produced two documentary films on Doshi. Subsequently\, architects Sanjay Mohe and Medappa will present their contributions to the campus design\, sharing their discoveries\, challenges\, and outcomes. The event will conclude with a dialogue on ‘creative collaboration’ among the speakers and a Q&A session with the audience. \nIn collaboration with: \n             \n
