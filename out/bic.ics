SUMMARY:The Plate is a Portal
DESCRIPTION:Food holds the power to nourish and sustain us\, to delight and transport us. A good meal can collapse the distance between my past and my present\, ferry me to faraway family\, or bring me closer to my inner child. For writers\, food is an especially potent means to delve into memory\, notions of home\, heritage\, and relationships. \nIn this workshop\, open to writers in all genres\, we will consider the plate as a portal\, reaching through sensorium and memory to explore what food can offer to our practice. We will read prose and poetry about food together and discuss the role that food plays as a cultural signifier\, as a love language in the domestic space\, as a carrier for history\, and more. \nThrough guided generative work\, participants will be invited to consider the food that has nourished them in its fullness – where it comes from\, what historical and personal narratives it holds\, what language it allows them to access\, how it might have changed over time. We’ll read\, write\, and share\, working together to discover the ways in which the theme of food can nourish our writing. \nWhile the workshop will be conducted in English\, and we’ll be reading primarily English-language texts\, writers are welcome to make use of any language(s) they wish to. \n

SUMMARY:From Playground to Podium
DESCRIPTION:Parents play a vital role in the sports journeys of any athlete. Whether it is introducing them to sport\, providing transport support\, managing nutrition\, providing encouragement or financing a career\, they are a vital cog in the wheel. \nParenting is challenging at the best of times. Parenting a child playing\, and aspiring to excel at\, sport is a complex balance that can stretch even the most confident and knowledgeable parent. Yet\, there are few resources for parents on navigating the complexities of career planning and management\, emotional support\, ambiguous progression pathways and opaque governance structures. \nThis event aims give an opportunity to parents who finds themselves searching for insights and experiences that might be valuable in their own journeys and those of their children and to foreground issues and provide perspectives to support parents on the journey of parenting their sports child.  \nThe event will host two panel discussions involving parents who have supported their children’s quests for sports excellence followed by a panel of experts who have advised athletes and parents on their journeys. Each panel discussion will be followed with a brief Q&A session. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Voices of Teesta
DESCRIPTION:42 minutes | Nepali\, English & Lepcha | English Subtitles \n“Before the formation of this holy Rongnue (Teesta) from the bottom of Kongchen (Khanchendzonga)\, \nWe used to narrate the parentage of River Rongnue\, \nWater of the river Teesta we use to offer during the ritual\, \nIf this water dries up\, there will be a drought\, \nRongnue is a holy water\, it is a god of water… Achulay\, we narrate as a song\, \nAchulay \nRongnue is the god of water…” \nWith hydro energy being one of the convenient and available energy source for the development of any given State\, the film tries to understand the relationship between various groups and communities of Sikkim and West Bengal with River Teesta. This film tries to trace the faint and unheard voices of local people who are affected by these developments. It travels from the source of River Teesta till the tip of the plains of North Bengal\, traverses through mini and mega hydel projects to capture these naked voices and their bond\, angst\, adaptation and reconciliation with River Teesta. \nThe story particularly revolves around the unique practice and beliefs of mountain communities and how they express their significance of the river through their folklore\, sacred rituals and scriptures. Communities from downstream struggle to balance their faith and religion with such developments and others confess the helpless need of sustaining and adapting to the changing economic patterns and surmounting unemployment. The film eventually ends with a question if Teesta will ever speak for herself. \nThe film screening will be followed by a panel discussion and Q&A with the audience. \nCredits:\nDirector: Minket Lepcha\nEditor: Wangyal Sherpa & Salil Mukhia\nCinematographer: Anup Aadin Das\nSound: Hishey Bhutia\nResearch: Kachyo Lepcha & Minket Lepcha \n

SUMMARY:Science\, Technology & Society in a Tumultuous World
DESCRIPTION:Politician\, economist\, social activist\, strategist\, or even mere scientist: Today\, an expert in any walk of life anywhere in the world feels like they are in a bus going downhill with the brakes only somewhat working. For us in India\, this kind of ride is everyday. Risks\, uncertainties\, and exigencies interfere daily with efforts  at careful planning and developing polices and their translation to action. Yet\, through the dust and churn around us\, it is worth examining how India has developed its policy and decision-making tools in complex and challenging areas since independence. Where have we done reasonably\, and where are there causes for concern for the future? \nIn the first third of this talk\, the speaker will summarise India’s science and technology journey from the early twentieth century to the present. Here\, they will also point out how the world of science and technology has changed. The next third will address how science and technology have been used and have enabled the rise of technology giants and of current societies. Finally explored will be the question of what the future holds for India—seen through the lens of science and technology—in a world that could not have been imagined in 1900? What awaits us in 2050\, a new\, placid\, peaceful valley\, or will the bus continue to careen along? \nThe talk will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nThis lecture is a part of Azim Premji University’s Public Lecture Series. \nPresented by:\n \n

SUMMARY:This Is Not a Solo
DESCRIPTION:This is not a solo | 23 min | Vanessa Vieira da Cunha\n(De)construction. The hidden. The exposed. What is. What was. What it no longer is but could be again. Antagonistic relationships create space for a gray place\, the place that inhabits what is not yet one thing or the other. This is not a solo aims to research and deepen issues related to identity\, the exposure of the self\, the importance we attribute to the set of qualities and particularities that we think define us\, the place of confrontation with the vision of the another\, the dizzying sensation of detaching ourselves from what is known and comfortable to reveal inner layers that remain inaccessible to others.\n \nEgo | Echo | 15 min | Indrek Kornel\nA dialogue between self and surroundings\, Ego | Echo explores the interplay of reflection an resonance. Hyper-aware of the textures\, sounds\, tastes\, and rhythms of the here and now\, the performer navigates the constant feedback loop between their body and the world around them. How does the echo of their presence alter the ego of their being? In this improvised journey\, they let each moment reshape them—a push and pull between intention and instinct\, order and chaos\, heaven and hell. It is a movement through the shifting landscapes of self and space\, where the only constant is the present. \nFloating Clouds | 15 min | Abhilash Ningappa\nFloating Clouds is a contemplative performance that examines the complexities of life through the lens of artistic expression. It reflects on the universal challenges\, aspirations\, and fleeting triumphs that shape the human experience The piece combines expressive dance\, spoken word\, and symbolic gestures to create a rich tapestry of movement and meaning. The choreography\, marked by fluidity and grace\, evokes the transient beauty of clouds\, offering a metaphor for the impermanence of life. Spoken text serves as a bridge\, drawing the audience into the narrative and fostering a shared space of reflection. Through its interplay of movement and language. Floating Clouds invites audiences to engage with themes of transformation\, resilience\, and the ephemeral nature of existence.\n \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Earthquake
DESCRIPTION:\n54 minutes | English\, Hindi\, Kannada | Suitable for 13+ Years\nTrigger Warnings: Themes of Loneliness \n\n\n\n\nDo you ever feel alone\, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection\, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week\, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends… Yet\, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together\, drifting apart\, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise… \nThis is an adaptation of “Bhūmikampa – Das Erdbeben” which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all\, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships\, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n“Mira and Sameer find themselves surrounded by unspoken words. ‘The Earthquake’ delves into the essence of human relationships—our connections\, routines\, distances\, and all the spaces in between. It asks us what it means to be truly seen or heard. What happens when we finally face the unspoken truths in our interpersonal relationships?”\n\n\n  \nCredits: \nPlaywrights: Marvin Krause and Samragni Dasgupta\nDirector: Shania Mathew \nCast: \nMira: Samragni Dasgupta\nSameer: Naman Roy \nThe Earthquake received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt München Kulturreferat (City of Munich). \nProduced by     \n\nWith Support from \n\n \n\n

SUMMARY:From Pax Americana to Pax Mysteriana
DESCRIPTION:The object of this lecture is to analyze the world order that was put in place at the end of World War II\, examine how it has unfolded in terms of experience since then\, and highlight some important manifestations of its multiple crises\, to discuss possible future scenarios for 2050.

SUMMARY:Smriti Pravah 2025
DESCRIPTION:When Rukmini Devi Arundale founded Kalakshetra in 1936\, she did not intend to create a new style of Bharatnatyam. Yet\, the Kalakshetra bani emerged—a new approach that distinguished itself from the traditional ‘sadir’ style. Rukmini Devi’s choreography blended classical purity with innovative storytelling\, giving rise to a new school of Bharatanatyam that balanced tradition with modern sensibilities. \nOver two decades ago\, Kalakshetra alumna Swagata Sen Pillai began curating Smriti Pravah in memory of Rukmini Devi\, celebrating her legacy on her birth anniversary and bringing together Kalakshetra students worldwide to honor their guru. After Swagata’s untimely passing due to COVID\, her friends and seniors from Kalakshetra\, Tripti Bhupen and Archita Mehta\, have continued this tradition. \nIn 2025\, on Rukmini Devi’s 121st anniversary\, Archita Mehta’s NrityaSadhana Centre for Bharatanatyam and Indian Folk Dances\, and Tripti Bhupen’s Samarpan School of Performing Arts take a journey into her creative world\, where she preserved Bharatanatyam’s traditions while innovating within its structure. \nThe performance will be in two parts: the first will highlight pieces from the margam choreographed by Rukmini Devi’s direct disciples\, while the second will explore her timeless dance dramas. \nThis year’s performers include Kalakshetra alumni Archita Mehta\, Tripti Bhupen\, Gayatri Krishnaveni Lakshmanan\, Vasundhara Thomas\, Priyashri Rao\, Lasya Priya R\, and Nrithika B Natesh. \nPresented by: \n  \n
