SUMMARY:Building India’s Swimming Dreams
DESCRIPTION:Aspirations of excellence know no borders.  \nAs Australia\, the world’s second-highest Olympic gold medalist nation in swimming\, crowns its ‘Green and Gold Decade’ with the 2032 Brisbane Olympics\, India is charting its own bold course: hosting the 2030 Commonwealth Games and setting its sights on the 2036 Olympics.  \nIn this timely conversation\, leading Indian and Australian sports figures come together to explore swimming as a shared arena of potential and partnership. Where does India stand in its swimming journey today? How can Australia’s storied expertise help shape a stronger swimming culture here?

SUMMARY:Shobane Pāḍa
DESCRIPTION:Shobane Pāḍa are the tender\, devotional songs that mark the milestones of a woman’s life (marriage\, childbirth\, festivals) where melody becomes memory\, and every note echoes love\, laughter\, and grace. Revealing how diverse voices and dialects carry the same heartfelt spirit\, two vibrant ensembles bring these songs to life: Pattalamma Janapada Kala Sangha from Mandya and GK Kala Vedika from North Karnataka.  \nThrough live renditions and storytelling\, the session explores the social and cultural significance of Shobane\, how these songs serve as a collective blessing\, a space for women to voice joy\, longing\, and devotion. The audience will be invited to experience the changing rhythms and tones that mark life’s transitions\, from the playful to the profound. \nThe fifth presentation in the BIC Janapada series\, this evening is a tribute to the music that has long held Karnataka’s communities together: in rhythm\, reverence\, and radiant joy. \nBIC Jaanapada is a bi-monthly (once in two months) series celebrating Karnataka’s folk traditions through the lens of regional identity and cultural preservation. Curated in collaboration with Tvarita Arts Collective India\, the program combines scholarly discourse with live performances to explore the deep connections between geography and artistic expression. Through demonstrations\, performances\, and academic discussions\, each session examines how landscape and local culture have shaped these distinct artistic practices. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Taboos at the Table
DESCRIPTION:Who gets to eat what\, how\, and with whom? \nIn South Asia\, food has never been just about sustenance\, but rather about hierarchy\, belonging\, and belief. From caste-based taboos of purity and pollution to colonial notions of civility and hygiene\, every meal tells a story of power and exclusion. \nThis session unpacks the politics of the plate: tracing Ambedkar’s critique in Beef\, Brahmins\, and Broken Men\, the Islamic philosophies of fasting and prohibition\, and the gendered labour that sustains domestic kitchens. It will also examine how global veganism intersects (and sometimes clashes) with South Asian histories of food\, faith\, and resistance. \nAn exploration of what it means to eat ethically\, communally\, and consciously in a world where the simple act of sharing food remains deeply political. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:Dancing on Walls
DESCRIPTION:Works of art are good things to think about. They awaken our senses\, invite interpretation\, and spark curiosity. Join us in the library to discover how art can nurture observation\, critical thinking\, and inquiry. \nIn this session\, we’ll dive into the world of Warli painting\, an ancient tribal art tradition of Maharashtra. Its distinctive pictogram style is rich in detail yet easy to decode and connect with. \nChildren will look closely at a Warli painting\, form thoughtful interpretations\, and wonder about the stories it holds. They’ll also have an opportunity to tell their own stories using Warli motifs. \nCome\, see\, think\, and wonder with us! \nAround the World in 50 Sundays is a journey that begins\, not with a ticket\, but with opening a book. In a city like Bangalore where families are always in motion\, the BIC Library hopes to offer stillness and a quiet\, welcoming space for both parents and children where reading becomes a shared way of being and not a task. \nEvery Sunday\, we open our doors to invite you into a library that listens; building a rhythm of return\, a habit of joy and a new community bound not just by books\, but by the weekly ritual of reading together. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Material\, Memory\, and the Sacred
DESCRIPTION:For Aboubakar Fofana\, nature is not a resource\, it is divine.  \nEvery leaf\, every drop of water\, every hue of indigo is a manifestation of the sacred. Born in Mali and raised in France\, Fofana is a multidisciplinary artist and designer whose work in calligraphy\, textiles\, and natural dyes\, is rooted in reverence for the natural world and its cycles of creation\, decay\, and renewal. \nIn this conversation\, he reflects on indigo as both material and metaphor\, a living substance that embodies memory\, ecology\, and spirituality. Through fermentation and rhythm\, his practice becomes meditation: a dialogue between human intention and the intelligence of nature. He will also share insights from his work in Siby\, Mali\, where he is building a community-led indigo farm that integrates food\, medicine\, and dye plants into a holistic ecosystem. \nAn invitation to rediscover the sacred in the soil: where art\, devotion\, and the divine converge in living colour. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Judge and Be Judged: Musings on the Top Court
DESCRIPTION:As the Supreme Court of India completes seventy-five years\, how do we understand its role in shaping the country’s institutions and democratic ideals?

The discussion features Justice S. Muralidhar\, Justice N. Santosh Hegde\, Dr. Aditya Sondhi and Radhika Chitkara\, as they explore the intersections of law\, legitimacy and justice in contemporary India.\n \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Asymptomatic
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever asked yourself\, “Why me?” Staring at the odds stacked against you\, wondering why the world feels so unfair? \nAsymptomatic is a sharp\, darkly funny solo performance that unpacks those moments of rejection. Blending comedy\, tragedy\, farce\, dance\, and stand-up\, it follows an artist hungry for success\, constantly rebuffed\, and forever proving their worth.  \nWith biting humour and fearless honesty\, Asymptomatic turns rejection into revelation\, exposing the quiet\, invisible power systems that decide who gets to rise and who’s left behind.  \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Raga Play
DESCRIPTION:The evening unfolds as a journey between two emotional worlds: one introspective\, the other unrestrained. \nSitarist Snehesh Nag\, known for his soulful precision and fluid expressiveness\, is joined by Shrivatsa Koulgi on tabla for a performance that explores the duality of Hindustani raga music. The “serious” raga invites quiet reflection\, bound by structure and emotional gravity\, while the “light” raga celebrates freedom by weaving playful turns\, folk colours\, and spontaneous joy. \nTogether\, they create a conversation between depth and delight\, discipline and abandon; a meeting point of heart and art. \nIn collaboration with:\n      \n

SUMMARY:Exploring the Speculative City
DESCRIPTION:Over the past two decades\, Bengaluru’s exploding real estate sector and massive infrastructure investments have led to land speculation targeting working-class neighborhoods and agricultural land for development. Chronicles of a Global City turns Bengaluru inside out to examine its “world-city” transformation that stimulated rapid urbanization and unbounded growth. Moving the spotlight away from the urban elites and the new middle class\, the essays in the volume explore how people caught up in the whirlwinds of change in Bengaluru—from construction laborers\, street vendors\, domestic workers\, and platform delivery workers to small-time property brokers\, petty landlords\, and local politicians—experience\, struggle\, aspire\, invent\, strive and speculate to make a livable city for themselves. \nGrounded in long-term ethnographic research\, the volume introduces the idea of “speculative urbanism” to reveal the complex entanglements of finance\, real estate\, livelihoods\, and ecology in Bengaluru’s unfolding futures. \nThe discussion features contributors to the volume and two discussants\, followed by a Q&A with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:"Shhh… Listen!"
DESCRIPTION:Beneath the rhythm of drums and the sweep of dance\, a quiet plea rises from the marshes\, the reeds\, and the frog king. \n\nShhh… Listen! is a powerful\, multidisciplinary performance that gives voice to the voiceless: our vanishing wetlands\, their unseen creatures\, and the communities most affected by their loss. At its heart lies a tale of beauty and loss: a vibrant marshland silenced by pollution and bulldozers\, yet still whispering a call to renewal. Through music\, movement\, and myth\, Shhh… Listen! reminds us that the wetlands are not wastelands\, but living\, breathing worlds\, waiting to be heard again. \nThrough Kattaikkuttu\, Parai\, Oyilattam\, Oppari\, and Bharatanatyam\, performers from historically marginalised communities embody both the living pulse of nature and the pain of its erasure. Their art\, rooted in resilience and reverence\, becomes an act of remembrance and protest\, linking ecological destruction with social injustice. \nAt once an ecological lament and a deeply human one\, Shhh… Listen! bridges the fates of land and life. A poetic call to listen anew; to the whispers of the earth\, the silenced voices of its keepers\, and the music that still stirs beneath the mud and rain. \nCredits\nArtistic Director: Sangeeta Isvaran\nScript: Shrilakshmi Sridhar\, Sangeeta Isvaran\nLyrics: Thilagavathi Palani\nPerformaned by: The Katradi Youth Dance Theatre \nThis performance is part of the larger Coexistence Mela at BIC on Nov 22 and 23.

SUMMARY:A Flaming Forest
DESCRIPTION:49 min | Kannada with English Subtitles | Documentary | India \nBetween protection and possession lies the story of the Soliga and their burning forest. \nA Flaming Forest is a powerful documentary that captures the Soliga adivasis’ deep\, ancestral bond with the forests of the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) Tiger Reserve—and the heartbreak of being displaced from them in the name of conservation. Through quiet observation and intimate storytelling\, the film reveals both the loss and the resistance that arise when conservation excludes the very people who have lived in harmony with nature for generations. \nWinner of the Best Depiction of the Climate Emergency at Film Southasia 2024\, A Flaming Forest has travelled through film festivals and universities worldwide\, sparking urgent conversations on what true\, inclusive conservation should look like. \nDirected by Salman Javeed\, Satya Ambasta\, and Vivek Sangwan\, the film blends ethnography and cinema to ask: can we protect the forest without silencing its people? \nCredits\nProduction: Srishti Films\nExecutive Producer: Sanjay Barnela\nEditing and Sound Design: Salman Javeed\nCinematography: Sanjay Barnela\, Salman Javeed\, Vivek Sangwan\nDirector of Research: Nitin Rai\nResearch and Production: Anandi Mehra\, Paromita Bathija\, Satya Ambasta \nThis performance is part of the larger Coexistence Mela at BIC on Nov 22 and 23.

SUMMARY:Western Disturbances and Climate Variability
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wondered where India’s winter rain and snow come from? What causes the sudden cold weather\, thick fog\, and heavy rainfall that often affect north India? The answer is in a type of storm known as western disturbances. \nWestern disturbances (WDs) are massive storms\, usually coming from the Mediterranean or surrounding regions\, that travel thousands of kilometres eastward until they arrive at the Himalayas. There\, the Arabian Sea acts as a water source\, fuelling WD-driven rainfall and snowfall along the plains\, hilly regions\, and mountains. As a result\, WDs are the main source of water for these regions\, essential for farmers (producing rabi crop) and water security (replenishing glaciers). \nBut\, WDs also have a dangerous side. They drive extreme weather and extreme impacts including flash floods\, avalanches\, landslides\, fog\, and thunderstorms. In this talk\, I will discuss what we know about WDs\, including where they come from\, how they intensify\, and how well we can track and predict them. I’ll also cover some new research\, including how they’re affected by climate change and how they’re starting to interact with the summer monsoon in catastrophic ways\, such as the heavy flooding in Uttarakhand in 2013\, North India in 2023\, and during this year’s monsoon. \nThis session is part of the Let’s Talk Climate Change Talk series. \nPresented by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Women No Longer Wait
DESCRIPTION:Arundhathi Subramaniam’s new poems map a wobbling world\, trying to find its axis in a season of change. Fabrics tear\, lands splinter\, stances harden\, loved ones die\, names dissolve. But wandering through these pages are some extraordinary women—women who vault nimbly over borders\, walk naked\, walk aslant\, and sometimes upside down. Blurring the divide between the mundane and the magical\, the historical and the imaginary\, they point to a new world that might lie within the folds of the old. A world that requires a new set of skills: how to find the right nicknames\, how to ‘gatecrash into the present’\, how to ‘go skinny-dipping in the self’. These are songs of bewilderment\, insight and startling freedom. \nThis session with poet Arundhathi Subramaniam\, interspersed with poetry readings\, will trace the journey of her recent trilogy on the theme of the sacred and the feminine – a journey that reaches its culmination with this new collection of poems celebrating women and upside-downness. She will be in conversation with author\, Shinie Antony. \nA Q&A session will follow. \n

SUMMARY:Dual Margam 6
DESCRIPTION:When movement whispers and stillness breathes\, something enduring is set in motion. \nOn our next evening of Dual Margam\, two distinct classical traditions return in dialogue – the lyrical subtlety of Manipuri from Manipur and the architectural elegance of Odissi from Odisha. \nManipuri\, in its feminine form\, is marked by circular motion\, understated footwork\, and an inward quietude that evokes devotion and tenderness. Odissi\, by contrast\, is shaped through defined stances and sculpted transitions\, where each turn of the body becomes an offering of story and song. \nThis performance brings together two women dancers in the Odissi–Manipuri conversation\, setting two vocabularies side by side: one fluid and veiled\, the other precise and chiselled. \nThe second in a two-part Odissi–Manipuri dialogue\, this evening unfolds through the feminine body\, following last month’s exploration by two male dancers. \nThe Dual Margam series curates two classical dance forms of India to highlight their similarities and differences. The solo performances honour traditional repertoire (the Margam)\, while the duet will juxtapose each unique form with another. \nSupported by:\n \n
