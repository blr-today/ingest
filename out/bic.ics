SUMMARY:Travelling without Travelling
DESCRIPTION:“The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.” – St Augustine \nIn this silent reading session\, we’ll journey through the captivating world of travel writing. From historical explorers like Marco Polo and Ibn Batutta to modern authors such as Dervla Murphy\, Pico Iyer and Michael Palin\, we’ll explore how the themes of travel have evolved over time. Through their words\, we’ll glimpse not only different regions but also the authors’ unique perspectives and passions\, allowing us to travel the world vicariously through their eyes. \nYou can bring your own book or choose one from the collection at the library\, pick a cosy spot and read with us for 90 minutes. Post this\, spend a few minutes chatting with us about your read. \nLooking forward to seeing you all there! \nThis event is a part of BIC’s Programmes at the Library. \nBIC Library Programmes are designed to mould the library into a community-centered reading space. Our primary goal is to curate sessions that cater to the diverse interests and ages within our library community. Through this programming we wish for the library to become a dynamic space that goes beyond traditional book-related activities. \nWe also aim to provide a platform for members of the community to sometimes host these events we curate. If you have event ideas that align with our vision\, please reach out to us at collab@bangaloreinternationalcentre.org \n

SUMMARY:Decoding the Language of a Cinematic Polymath
DESCRIPTION:A new cinema movement emerged in India in the late 1960s with a proposition for artistic cinema not influenced by any considerations other than creative and aesthetic. The promise of this movement\, known variously as “Indian New Wave”\, “New Cinema” or “Parallel Cinema” was that conscientious filmmakers will make cinema which will bear the distinct stamp of the creative artist and not that of a studio. In form and aesthetics\, the new wave aimed to reject the forms and values of commercial cinema which relied on the stars\, the gaudy sets\, many irrelevant musical sequences and melodrama. This movement attracted many young artists who went on to become well-known auteurs. Indian new wave’s body of work\, spanning close to three decades\, charted a new course in cinema aesthetics with its zealous attempts to experiment with the language of cinema. At the same time\, the new wave auteurs’ steadfast political commitment resulted in a critical examination of the complexities of India’s socio-political realities. \nIt is important to point out that there was no formal process or a formally run operation for this movement. Although the initial impetus to the movement came from the loans provided by the Film Finance Corporation\, the passion to make artistic cinema\, fuelled by the newly trained filmmakers from the Film and Television Institute of India\, spread to different parts of the country. \nIn the Kannada language\, serendipitously\, the first artistic attempt to break free from reigning commercial filmmaking practices came in 1970 when Pattabhirama Reddy produced and directed Samskara – at approximately the same time when the Film Finance Corporation was funding what are considered as the first three films of the Indian new wave: Uski Roti\, Ankur and Sara Aakash. Samskara’s success was followed by a few other experiments by filmmakers such as Girish Karnad\, N Lakshminarayan and BV Karanth. \nBut the one auteur who went on to make some of the most influential and groundbreaking films and put Kannada cinema on the world map was Girish Kasaravalli. \nGirish Kasaravalli graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India in 1975\, and his first film as a Director was Ghatashraddha (1977). In the last 47 years since\, Girish’s body of work – 17 feature films and one television series – has critically engaged with the social\, political\, ideological\, philosophical and environmental concerns of the Kannada society and\, in a larger sense\, of India. Kasaravalli’s films have won him four Golden Lotuses (National Award for best feature film from the Government of India)\, a Padma Shri and many other awards and recognitions in film festivals across the world. \nToday\, when we have access to a variety of content at our fingertips\, it is essential to engage with the work of Girish Kasaravalli and learn his remarkable mastery of the formal\, aesthetic and thematic aspects of filmmaking and understand his contributions to film art.. \nIn this retrospective of Girish Kasaravalli\, we screen five of his films and also have conversations with him and other collaborators after each screening. \n\n\n\nEvent \nDate \nTime \n\n\nIntroduction and Context Setting\nSaturday\, May 4\n2:30 – 2:45 pm\n\n\nGhatashraddha (The Ritual) \n108 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 1977\nSaturday\, May 4\n2:45 – 4:45 pm\n\n\nGirish Kasaravalli in conversation with Basav Biradar\nSaturday\, May 4\n5:30 – 6:30 pm\n\n\nThaayi Saheba \n119 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 1997\nSaturday\, May 4\n7:00 – 9:00 pm\n\n\nIntroduction and Context Setting​\nSunday\, May 5\n10:30 – 11:00 am\n\n\nGulabi Talkies  \n118 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2008\nSunday\, May 5\n11:00- 1:00 pm\n\n\nKoormavatara \n115 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2011\nSunday\, May 5\n2:30 – 4:45 pm\n\n\nGirish Kasaravalli in conversation with Nikhila H\nSunday\, May 5\n5:30 – 6:30 pm\n\n\nKanasemba Kudareyeneri \n105 mins | Kannada with English subtitles | 2010\nSunday\, May 5\n6:45 – 9:00 pm\n\n\n\n  \nB-Cinematic \nCalling all cinephiles! BIC is thrilled to introduce B-Cinematic\, an initiative dedicated to celebrating the most essential\, impactful\, and artistically significant cinematic works from across the state and the country. \nAt B-Cinematic\, our mission is to curate and share those remarkable films that is a must-watch (or re-watch) experience for every passionate cinema lover. From groundbreaking classics to under-appreciated gems\, our carefully curated selection will take you on an unparalleled (pun not intended) cinematic journey through the ages. \nThrough curated screenings\, insightful discussions\, and engaging analyses from distinguished cinematic voices\, we aim to not only watch these films together but to truly appreciate their craftsmanship\, cultural impact\, and intellectual depth. Our vibrant community of film aficionados will collectively rediscover Indian cinema’s most stunning and enduring masterpieces. \nSo join us on this quest to experience the films that have defined and redefined the art form. Don’t miss out on crossing these essential works off your bucket list. Because to truly live\, you must first watch the films that make life worth living. \n

SUMMARY:Echoes of AI
DESCRIPTION:On the surface\, an Indian doctor\, a British poet\, an UberEats courier in Pittsburgh\, and a Chinese activist in exile have nothing in common. But they are in fact linked by a profound common experience―unexpected encounters with artificial intelligence. In her debut book Code Dependent\, shortlisted for the inaugural Women’s Prize for Non-fiction 2024\, Madhumita Murgia shows how automated systems are reshaping our lives all over the world\, from technology that marks children as future criminals\, to an app that is helping to offer medical diagnoses to a remote tribal community. \nBy highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley\, Madhumita explores the impact of this often-exploitative technology on individuals\, communities\, and our wider society. \nVidushi Marda\, a lawyer and researcher\, specialises in examining the socio-legal ramifications of data-driven technologies. Her research centers on technology regulation\, asymmetric power dynamics\, and fundamental rights. Through her endeavors\, she collaborates with governments\, corporations\, and technical communities to promote social justice. \nTogether\, they will discuss and unpack how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency\, and shatter our illusion of free will. AI has already infiltrated our day-to-day\, through language-generating chatbots like ChatGPT and social media. But it’s also affecting us in more insidious ways. It touches everything from our interpersonal relationships\, to our kids’ education\, work\, finances\, public services\, and even our human rights. It is already changing what it means to be human\, in ways large and small\, and Madhumita and Vidushi reveal what could happen if we fail to reclaim our humanity. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:The Amazon-Walmart Showdown
DESCRIPTION:As consumers prefer omni-channel (combination of online and offline retail) shopping\, firms have been forced to follow. Yet\, the gig economy is unprofitable\, most retailers find online sales to be earnings dilutive\, and even Amazon’s online retail operations continue to be loss making after 30 years. \nThe presentation articulates the challenges of online sales\, when ecommerce can be profitable\, and the general 4P (people\, planet\, profits\, and privacy) problems facing the last mile delivery models. \nBased on the book Clash: Amazon versus Walmart\, this session will explore what the prognosis is for two of the largest companies in the world. \n

SUMMARY:ಅದ್ಭುತ ರಾಮಾಯಣ | Adbhuta Ramayana
DESCRIPTION:Kannada | 70 mins | Suitable for all ages \n‘Adbhuta Ramayana’ is yet another retelling of the immortal and eternal story of Sita\, Rama and Ravana. This production is an adaptation of Kandagal Hanumantha Rao’s four-hour long musical company theatre production into the language of puppets and Sangeet-natak genre. \nFramed fantastically as a story within a story where all the characters are aware of their fates in the various versions of the epic\, ‘Adbhuta Ramayana’ features Shata Kantha Ravana – a hundred-headed Ravana – who attempts to bring a rift between Sita and Rama with his trickery and illusions. \nThe performance uses traditional devices of the jester/narrator\, an eclectic mix of music\, song and lights\, while using this mythological episode to focus a stronger gaze on our current lives\, while the centre of the story remains the colourful and intricate leather puppets. \nDirected by Rajani Garud\nAdapted by Prakash Garud\nProduced by Gombe Mane\, Dharwad \n

SUMMARY:सकल जानि हे नाथ | Sakal Jaani He Naath
DESCRIPTION:Hindi\, Bundelkhandi\, Brajawali\, Awadhi | 75 Mins | Suitable for Ages 16+ \nMen are Innocent. Or so they say while playing victim card\, thereby alleging the Women Guilty as Charged! \nSakal Jaani he Naath is a comedy folk musical adapted from Vasant Deo’s Sudama ke Chawal. It revisits the famed mythological fable about Lord Krishna and his childhood friend Sudama. A Tragic-Comedy that explores the narrative of the contemporary human situation and is a satire on today’s man\, his double standards and polluted mind. While the story and characters are the same\, the ethos of these characters is what is seen today and in common life. The age-old tale and its characters have been used only as a reference. \nThe play runs parallel with Narottam Das’s Sudamacharit and their verses are sung in folk tunes of Doha and Behre Tavil. \n

SUMMARY:Main Tawaif
DESCRIPTION:Main Tawaif is a presentation by Manjari Chaturvedi\, under The Courtesan Project Series. 15 years in existence\, the series is founded and conceptualised by Classical Dancer\, Creator of Sufi Kathak\, and Restorer of the Dance of Tawaifs\, Manjari Chaturvedi. The Courtesan Project has become one of the most successful dance revival movements in today’s time. Giving a voice to the women and 100s of years of creative contribution to theatre\, cinema and performing arts. \nThis performance is an exploration of the gender dynamics within the arts\, unveiling the pivotal influence of women performers – the enigmatic Tawaifs and Baijis – of North India from the 16th to the 20th century. The performance is set as an intimate mehfil performance of how the Tawaifs would perform in yesteryears. Their music\, their stories\, their dance enacted by a single performer. \nThis is a bold statement that is needed to finally accord respect for the performance art of the Tawaif\, to go beyond the drawing room sniggers and laughter associated with the word Tawaif\, and to finally acknowledge their role in history. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:A Home in the Constant Flux
DESCRIPTION:Installation Opening: Saturday\, 25th May 2024\, 11am\nInstallation on show until Sunday\, 26th May 2024\, 8pm \nWalkthrough with the Curator: \nSaturday\, 25th May\, 6pm – 7pm\nSunday\, 26th May\, 12:15pm – 1:15pm \nPanel Discussion:\nSunday\, 26th May\, 11am – 12pm \nThe exercise to retrace the intangible memories entwined with tangible objects is what created the research-based series of thirty-six photos A Home in the Constant Flux: A Call to the Verb Memory. The central idea of this photo-series is that during migration of people across geographies\, the objects of love and necessity undergo the arduous ordeal\, and that these\, bearing the patina of age\, create a desire to develop an understanding that personal histories are not isolated from the political selves. \nThe technique of cyanotypes\, which is used to print the archival maps for A Home in the Constant Flux: A Call to the Verb Memory metamorphoses into a metaphor of capriciousness – endured by refugees. As the cartographic lines\, in various shades of blue and white\, overlap the digital images of the objects\, they gesture at the fluidity of the memory only to find itself resistant to the burden of confinement around the refugees. The aesthetic of distortion – in the form of borders\, the viscosity of the blues and whites\, and the ballet of letters – epitomises the inevitability of embracing impermanence as one of the few constants in a life on the move. The element of distortion serves as a bridge between abstract and representation to encourage the viewer to navigate and map the photo series in order to question the boundaries of perception. \nThe panel discussion on the second day of the event will delve into the influence of visual representation on refugee narratives\, particularly in light of the surge of imagery overpowering the social and print media in recent years. This influx frequently drowns out the individual voices of refugees\, maintaining stereotypical visual stereotypes that confine visual language of that of a destitute ‘other’. Furthermore\, the conversation will confront the inherent tendency to marginalize migrants through photography\, highlighting the disparity between mainstream portrayals and the more empathetic and authentic depictions found in the research-based project A Home in the Constant Flux: A Call to the Verb Memory. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n  \n

SUMMARY:The Accelerating Expanding Universe
DESCRIPTION:Dark energy is the leading candidate for the mechanism that is responsible for causing the cosmological expansion to accelerate. Bharat Ratra will describe the astronomical data which persuade cosmologists that (as yet undetected) dark energy and dark matter are by far the main components of the energy budget of the universe at the present time. He will review how these observations have led to the development of a quantitative “standard” model of cosmology that describes the evolution of the universe from an early epoch of inflation to the complex hierarchy of structure seen today. In this non-technical talk\, he will also discuss the basic physics\, and the history of ideas\, on which this model is based. \nIn collaboration with Raman Research Institute\, Bangalore. \n \n

SUMMARY:ನಾಟಿದೇವಚರಿತೆ | Natyadevacharite
DESCRIPTION:Kannada | 75 mins | Suitable for Ages 8+ \n‘ನಾಟಿದೇವಚರಿತೆ’ ನಾಟಕದ ಕಥಾವಸ್ತುವು ಹಾಸ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ವಿಡಂಬನೆಯ ಮಿಶ್ರಣದಿಂದ ಕೂಡಿದೆ. ನಾಟಕವು ಶ್ರೀಮಂತ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯೊಬ್ಬನ ಕುಟುಂಬದ ಸುತ್ತ ಸುತ್ತುತ್ತದೆ. ಆ ಶ್ರೀಮಂತನು ಧಾರ್ಮಿಕತೆಯ ಬೂಟಾಟಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಪ್ರದರ್ಶಿಸುವ ಒಬ್ಬ ನಕಲಿ ಗುರುವಿನ ತಂತ್ರಕ್ಕೆ ಮಾರುಹೊಗುತ್ತಾನೆ. ಕಳ್ಳ ಗುರುವು ಶ್ರೀಮಂತ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯ ಪ್ರಶ್ನಾತೀತ ಅನುಸರಣೆಯ ಲಾಭವನ್ನು ಪಡೆಯುತ್ತಾನೆ. ಇದರಿಂದ ಬೇಸೆತ್ತ ಕುಟುಂಬವು ಉಪಾಯವಾದ ಯೋಜನೆಯನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸುವಲ್ಲಿ ತೊಡಗುತ್ತದೆ. ಈ ಯೋಜಬೆಯ ಬಲೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಪಟ ಗುರುವು ಸಿಕ್ಕಿಬೀಳಿತ್ತಾನೆಯೇ ಎಂಬ ಕಾತುರತೆಯನ್ನು ಈ ಪ್ರಸ್ತುತಿಯು ಪ್ರೇಕ್ಷಕರಲ್ಲಿ ಉಂಟುಮಾಡುತ್ತದೆ. ನಾಟಕವು ಮುಖ್ಯ ವಿಷಯವಾದ ಧಾರ್ಮಿಕ ನಡವಳಿಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿನ ಅಪ್ರಾಮಾಣಿಕತೆ\, ತಪ್ಪು ಜನರನ್ನು ನಂಬುವ ಅಪಾಯಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ಯಾರನ್ನಾದರೂ ಕುರುಡಾಗಿ ಅನುಸರಿಸುವುದನ್ನು ಹಾಸ್ಯದ ಲೇಪನದಲ್ಲಿ ತೋರಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. ಹಾಸ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ವಿಡಂಬನೆಯ ಮೂಲಕ\, `ನಾಟಿದೇವಚರಿತೆ~ ಕುರುಡು ನಂಬಿಕೆಯ ಪರಿಣಾಮಗಳನ್ನು ಮತ್ತು ಧಾರ್ಮಿಕ ಬೂಟಾಟಿಕೆಗಳ ಹಾಸ್ಯಮಯ ಅಂಶಗಳನ್ನು ಬಿಚ್ಚಿಡುತ್ತದೆ. \nThe play ‘Natydevacharite\,’ revolves around a rich man who becomes vulnerable to a fake imposter guru pretending to be pious and religious. The plot unfolds through a mix of comedy and drama\, revealing the guru’s insincerity. The guru takes advantage of the wealthy man`s unquestioning admiration. As the family plots a smart plan\, the audience is invited to watch the unfolding events\, wondering if the imposter will be caught. The main theme humorously explores the dishonesty in religious behavior\, the risks of trusting the wrong people\, and the outcomes of blindly following someone\, all presented in a satirical manner. The play aims to entertain while shedding light on the dangers of blindly trusting those who manipulate religious appearances for personal gain. Through its mix of comedy and drama\, ‘Natydevacharite’ unfolds a tale that prompts the audience to reflect on the consequences of misplaced trust and the humorous aspects of religious hypocrisy. \nAbout the Team \nSanchaya is a theatre group which has made a name for itself in the art and culture circles of Bangalore. Established in 1988\, Sanchaya was the dream child of G. S. Rama Rao\, a teacher at MES High School\, Jayanagar\, Bangalore. Fondly called GSR by Sanchayans\, he envisioned the role of art and culture in moulding human personalities\, and brought together his students to form a troupe. Aptly named Sanchaya (meaning “Coming together of”)\, it was intended to be a melting pot of drama\, literature\, and creativity. The team started out by putting together plays by the then students and now\, founding members. The very first play “Vallabhapuriya Dantakathe” set the beginning for the wonderful journey that is in its 33rd year now. Many plays followed and with it\, the transformation of the troupe from a student-centered group to a professionally managed popular theatre team. Today we have a repertoire of more than 40 plays. Along the way\, we have had gratifying achievements that make us proud. We have reached theatre lovers across many cities in India. We have performed at “Bharat Rang Mahotsav” hosted by National School of Drama\, New Delhi. The play “Pratibimbagalu” garnered wide critical acclaim for the multi-dimensional portrayal of a classic play. We have also organized many Theatre Festivals to provide a platform for young amateur teams to showcase their plays. With the vision of bringing all the theatre teams of Bangalore together\, we organized a flagship event called “Ranga-Ugadi”. We call these endeavors “Enriching Theater Brotherhood”. Not restricting our vista to plays alone\, we have been organizing musical events as well. Sanchaya’s directorial repertoire includes prominent theatre artists like C.G. Krishnamurthy\, R. Nagesh\, S. Surendranath\, Suresh Anagalli\, Krishnamurthy Kavathar\, S. K. Madhava Rao\, Abbur Jayatheertha\, Kathlu Satya\, Iqbal Ahmed\, Joseph John\, Shashidhar Barighat\, among others. It has groomed many artists who have become famous film and TV actors\, producers\, and directors today. We are also very proud of having enticed a whole new generation of youngsters towards theatre\, keeping with the true spirit of GSR. Our theatre family\, as we like to call it\, has grown to include more than 200 members. \nಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನ ಕಲಾ ಪ್ರಪಂಚದಲ್ಲಿ ಸಂಚಯ ತಂಡ ತನ್ನದೇ ಆದ ಛಾಪನ್ನು ಮೂಡಿಸಿದೆ. 1988ರಲ್ಲಿ ಸ್ಥಾಪನೆಯಾದ ಸಂಚಯ\, ಎಂ.ಇ.ಎಸ್ ಪ್ರೌಢಶಾಲೆಯ ಶಿಕ್ಷಕರಾದ ಜಿ.ಎಸ್.ರಾಮರಾವ್ ಅವರ ಕನಸಿನ ಕೂಸು. ಜಿ.ಎಸ್.ಆರ್ ಮಾನವ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿತ್ವವನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸುವಲ್ಲಿ ಕಲೆ ಮತ್ತು ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿಯ ಪಾತ್ರವನ್ನು ಕಲ್ಪಿಸಿಕೊಂಡವರು. ಇದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಅವರು ತಮ್ಮ ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿಗಳನ್ನು ಒಟ್ಟುಗೂಡಿಸಿ ತಂಡವನ್ನು ರಚಿಸಿದರು. ಸಂಚಯ (ಅಂದರೆ “ಒಟ್ಟುಗೂಡಿಸುವುದು”)ಎಂಬುದಾಗಿ ಸೂಕ್ತವಾಗಿ ಹೆಸರಿಸಲಾದ ಈ ತಂಡವು ನಾಟಕ\, ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ ಮುಂತಾದ ಹಲವು ಸೃಜನಶೀಲ ಕಲೆಗಳ ಸಮ್ಮಿಳನದ ಉದ್ದೇಶವನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿದೆ. ಈ ತಂಡವು ಅಂದಿನಿಂದ ಇಂದಿನವರೆಗೆ ನಿರಂತರವಾಗಿ ನಾಟಕಗಳನ್ನು ಪ್ರದರ್ಶಿಸುತ್ತಾ ಬಂದಿದೆ. \n“ವಲ್ಲಭಪುರಿಯ ದಂತಕಥೆ”ಎಂಬ ನಾಟಕದಿಂದ ಅದ್ಭುತ ರಂಗಪಯಣಕ್ಕೆ ನಾಂದಿ ಹಾಡಿದ ನಮ್ಮ ತಂಡ ಈಗ್ಗೆ ಮೂರು ದಶಕಗಳನ್ನು ಕಂಡಿದೆ. ತಂಡವು ವಿದ್ಯಾರ್ಥಿ-ಕೇಂದ್ರಿತ ಗುಂಪಿನಿಂದ ವೃತ್ತಿಪರವಾಗಿ ನಿರ್ವಹಿಸಲ್ಪಡುವ ಜನಪ್ರಿಯ ನಾಟಕ ತಂಡವಾಗಿ ರೂಪಾಂತರಗೊಂಡಿದೆ. ಇಂದು ನಮ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ 40ಕ್ಕೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ನಾಟಕಗಳ ಸಂಗ್ರಹವಿದೆ. \nಸಂಚಯ ತಂಡವು ಭಾರತದ ಅನೇಕ ನಗರಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ರಂಗಭೂಮಿ ಪ್ರೇಮಿಗಳನ್ನು ತಲುಪಿದೆ. ನವದೆಹಲಿಯ ನ್ಯಾಷನಲ್ ಸ್ಕೂಲ್ ಆಫ್ ಡ್ರಾಮಾ ಆಯೋಜಿಸಿದ “ಭಾರತ್ ರಂಗ್ ಮಹೋತ್ಸವ”ದಲ್ಲಿ “ಪ್ರತಿಬಿಂಬಗಳು” ನಾಟಕವನ್ನು ಪ್ರದರ್ಶಿಸಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರೀಯ ನಾಟಕದ ಬಹು ಆಯಾಮದ ಚಿತ್ರಣಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಈ ನಾಟಕವು ವಿಮರ್ಶಕರ ಮೆಚ್ಚುಗೆಯನ್ನು ಗಳಿಸಿತು. ರಾಜ್ಯದ ಇತರ ಹವ್ಯಾಸಿ ತಂಡಗಳಿಗೆ ಅವರ ನಾಟಕಗಳ ಪ್ರದಶನಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ವೇದಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ಒದಗಿಸುವ ಹಲವು ನಾಟಕೋತ್ಸವಗಳನ್ನು ಆಯೋಜಿಸಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನ ಎಲ್ಲಾ ನಾಟಕ ತಂಡಗಳನ್ನು ಒಂದೇ ವೇದಿಕೆಗೆ ತರುವ ಉದ್ದೇಶದಿಂದ “ರಂಗ-ಯುಗಾದಿ” ಎಂಬ ಕಾರ್ಯಕ್ರಮವನ್ನು ಆಯೋಜಿಸಿದ್ದೇವೆ. ನಮ್ಮ ಚಟುವಟಿಕೆಗಳನ್ನು ನಾಟಕ ಪ್ರದರ್ಶನಗಳಿಗಷ್ಟೇ ಸೀಮಿತಗೊಳಿಸದೆ\, ಹಲವಾರು ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ\, ಸಂಗೀತ ಕಾರ್ಯಕ್ರಮಗಳನ್ನೂ ಆಯೋಜಿಸಿದ್ದೇವೆ. \nಕನ್ನಡ ರಂಗಭೂಮಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಮುಖ ನಿರ್ದೇಶಕರಾದ ಸಿ.ಜಿ. ಕೃಷ್ಣಮೂರ್ತಿ\, ಆರ್.ನಾಗೇಶ್\, ಎಸ್.ಸುರೇಂದ್ರನಾಥ್\, ಸುರೇಶ್ ಆನಗಳ್ಳಿ\, ಕೃಷ್ಣಮೂರ್ತಿ ಕವತಾರ್\, ಎಸ್.ಕೆ.ಮಾಧವ ರಾವ್\, ಅಬ್ಬೂರು ಜಯತೀರ್ಥ\, ಕತ್ಲು ಸತ್ಯ\, ಇಕ್ಬಾಲ್ ಅಹಮದ್\, ಜೋಸೆಫ್ ಜಾನ್\, ಶಶಿಧರ್ ಭಾರಿಘಾಟ್ ಮುಂತಾದವರು ಸಂಚಯಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ನಾಟಕಗಳನ್ನು ನಿರ್ದೇಶಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. ಪ್ರಸಿದ್ಧ ಚಲನಚಿತ್ರ ಮತ್ತು ಟಿವಿ ನಟರು\, ನಿರ್ಮಾಪಕರು ಮತ್ತು ನಿರ್ದೇಶಕರಾದ ಅನೇಕ ಕಲಾವಿದರನ್ನು ಇಂದು ಸಂಚಯ ಅಲಂಕರಿಸಿದೆ. ಜಿ.ಎಸ್.ಆರ್ ಅವರ ನಿಜವಾದ ಸ್ಪೂರ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಇಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡು ಹೊಸ ಪೀಳಿಗೆಯ ಯುವಕರನ್ನು ರಂಗಭೂಮಿಯತ್ತ ಆಕರ್ಷಿಸಿದ್ದಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ನಾವು ತುಂಬಾ ಹೆಮ್ಮೆಪಡುತ್ತೇವೆ. ನಮ್ಮ ರಂಗಭೂಮಿ ಕುಟುಂಬ 200ಕ್ಕೂ ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಸದಸ್ಯರನ್ನು ಒಳಗೊಂಡು ಬೆಳೆದಿದೆ. \n

SUMMARY:Caste in Modern India
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: Friday\, 31 May\nTimings: 11:00 am – 8:00 pm\nExhibition on show until Sunday\, 2 June \nWalkthroughs:\nFriday\, 31 May | 6:00 pm\nSaturday\, 1 June | 11:30 am & 5:30 pm\nSunday\, 2 June | 10:45 am \nConversations:\nInaugural Address – Friday\, 31 May | 6:45 pm\nPanel Discussion – Sunday\, 2 June | 11:30 am \nRailways and postal services were introduced in colonial India in the early 1850s. In due course\, these new technologies made long-distance travel and communication widely accessible and affordable. In a parallel development\, the introduction of limited representation in legislatures in the 1890s added urgency to tap the potential trans-local identities enumerated in the decennial censuses beginning in 1871-72. \nIn view of these developments\, local communities\, in particular\, castes\, tapped new technologies to connect with kindred groups across the country and combine to form pan-Indian communities. Post offices allowed members of these aggregate groupings to correspond with each other\, while railways enabled them to meet periodically and devise strategies to capture a share in legislatures\, educational institutions and public employment proportionate to their census population. Drawing upon philatelic material covering a century\, the exhibition highlights the role of the postal system in this new politics. \nThe exhibition is divided into two broad parts that bring together correspondence and publications of several caste-based community organisations and individuals from across the country and the philatelic output of the post-colonial state. \nProf Gopal Guru will inaugurate the exhibition and deliver the inaugural address on May 31\, 6:45 pm. He will offer his comments on the exhibition and locate the images in the larger politics of visual culture. \nA Panel Discussion with Prof. Satish Deshapnde\, a distinguished social scientist who has made seminal contributions to our understanding of caste in independent India\, Vaishna Roy\, Editor-in-Chief\, Frontline magazine and Vikas Kumar\, Curator of the exhibit\, will take place on 2 June\, 11:30 am. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Rise and Fall of the Vanderbilts
DESCRIPTION:Once upon a time\, there was a family whose very name connoted wealth. The Vanderbilts had a vast empire built on freight through steamboats and railroads. Over a few generations\, the wealth-worth billions in today’s money-had been frittered away and the business itself faded as new options came up in the freight business. Their story remains an enduring example of what happens when business leaders fail to embrace the future and transform. \nBusiness transformation is a dynamic topic that is explored by authors R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya in their book Embrace the Future. A key lesson in the success or failure of such transformations lies in harmonising the art and science of change – the emotional and the rational – and striking the right balance between them. Both in life and in business\, a compelling narrative that inspires the organisation is essential for effecting transformation. Equally important is viewing transformation as an ongoing effort integrated into the work culture\, rather than solely reacting to crises. \nTheir book resonates with anyone who has encountered change—something prevalent in today’s ever-evolving business landscape. R Gopalakrishnan and Hrishi Bhattacharyya underscore that companies unwilling to adapt are bound to fade away. The authors will share their insight on how it’s imperative to draw lessons from the past\, navigate the present\, and prepare for the future. A Q&A with the audience will follow. \n
