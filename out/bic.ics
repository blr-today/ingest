SUMMARY:Ferdinand Kittel's Life and Works
DESCRIPTION:The Word and the Teacher / ಅರಿವು ಮತ್ತು ಗುರುವು / Das Wort und Der Lehrer\n80 mins |  English\, Kannada\, & German with English subtitles | 2023 | India\, Germany \n  \nRev. Ferdinand Kittel (1832 – 1903) was a missionary from Germany\, who spent 50 years of his life between India and Germany on his work as a writer\, translator\, linguist and lexicographer. This period film takes up the journey of his monumental work in the fields of lexicography and philology. Despite many challenges\, he mastered the Kannada language and created a huge dictionary and thesaurus unparalleled in any Indian language. He also taught in schools and produced more than 40 scholarly works. \nThis tri-lingual\, non-fiction film is shot in locations where Kittel lived and worked both in southern India and Germany\, and its first person narration uses his letters to his children in Germany\, and letters and reports to superiors. It includes archival photographs dating back to the early 19th century\, folk songs and poems written and translated by Kittel\, and Old Kannada literature. The film has been shown in different parts of Switzerland\, Germany & India. \nDuring the production of the film\, one of the early print typefaces of Kannada\, pioneered by Kittel and cast in Europe was digitised by the filmmaker\, Prashant Pandit\, and an open-source font in the name of Kittel was released for public use. This font was extensively used in the books published during the 1860s. The film also uses this font in the displayed texts. \nImage Credit\nHeader: Erstwhile Basel Mission Printing Press\, Mangaluru\, a still from the film\, The Word and the Teacher. Ferdinand Kittel supervised the publication of numerous books at the Press. \nProduction Crew:\nDirector\, Writer & Editor – Prashant Pandit\nCinematography – Chidanand GL & Florina Steiner\nSound – Anand V & Mahaveer S \n

SUMMARY:Freedom and Integrity
DESCRIPTION:There are many different views on what it means to be free. One popular perspective sees freedom as a form of independence: being free means not being held back or restricted by the expectations\, obligations\, or interference from others. After explaining the basic idea in more detail\, the talk discusses Bob Dylan’s work to illustrate the value of this kind of freedom while noting that some other parts of Dylan’s work seem to question this very idea of freedom. To explore the critique of freedom\, the talk turns to Robert Musil’s (1880-1942) unfinished novel The Man Without Qualities. One way to understand this celebrated novel is to see it as a partly hilarious\, partly deeply tragic and moving description of putting too much emphasis on an ideal of freedom as independence. Drawing on insights from moral philosophy\, the talk suggests that a proper understanding of the relation between independence and personal integrity can lead to a better appreciation of freedom as independence. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the lecture. \nThis lecture is a part of Vidyashilp University’s Public Lecture Series. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:गीर्वाण वाणी -BHARATHI
DESCRIPTION:Step into a heartfelt journey across time and tradition. In this special performance\, the untouched poetic gems of Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharathiyar are brought to life\, exploring the vision and passion behind words he once held close. \nOur story begins with the late Prof. K. V. Krishnan from Varanasi\, Bharathiyar’s own nephew\, whose lifelong love for his uncle’s work unearthed these hidden verses. Through his research\, we glimpse Bharathiyar not only as a poet but as a dreamer\, lighting fires of change. \nThe name Bharathi\, born of the Sanskrit “Abhāyām + Ratah”\, means “one who delights in fearlessness.” This performance honors him as a beacon of courage\, his words as arms of inspiration. \nThis evening offers a warm celebration of dance and verse; a simple yet powerful tribute to our fiery national poet\, whose voice still stirs hearts today. \nCredits \nMusic Direction – Dr. Rajkumar Bharathi\nVocal & Nattuvangam – Swati Athmanathan\nMridangam\, Tabla & Voiceover – Sri.

SUMMARY:The Nation Wants to Know - A Stand up Special
DESCRIPTION:From Mumbai to New York\, laughter truly needs no visa! \nAnuvab Pal’s The Nation Wants To Know is a fast-paced\, razor-sharp comedic journey through the quirks of modern India\, and how they echo with (or utterly confuse) audiences across the globe. With his signature blend of wit\, warmth\, and wild storytelling\, Anuvab moves from the absurdities of colonial hangovers to the chaotic charm of startups\, social media spats\, and airline adventures. \nThis isn’t just a stand-up show; it’s a cultural joyride. After sold-out performances in 11 countries and 27 cities\, Anuvab now brings back his international tales\, asking: what happens when India’s inside jokes meet the world’s outside gaze? \nPraised as “hysterically funny” by Time Out and “brilliant” by the Hindustan Times\, Anuvab’s satire strikes a chord with audiences of all ages. Whether you’re nostalgic for Doordarshan or deep into meme culture\, his humour finds you and welcomes you in. \nIt’s one evening\, many Indias\, and more than a few unexpected truths as punchlines. \n

SUMMARY:Perfect Days
DESCRIPTION:123 minutes | Japanese with English subtitles | Japan | 2023 \nWriter & Director: Wim Wenders\nScriptwriter: Takuma Takasaki\nStarring: Koji Yakusho\, Tokio Emoto\, Arisa Nakano\, Aoi Yamada\, and others.\nComposer: Patrick Watson \nA quiet life with all its nuances\, beautifully observed. \nLegendary filmmaker Wim Wenders returns to fiction with a luminous story set in the heart of Tokyo\, where the extraordinary hides in plain sight. At its center is Hirayama\, played with quiet brilliance by Cannes 2023 Best Actor Koji Yakusho. He finds peace and purpose in the rhythms of his days: tending to the city’s public toilets\, listening to old cassette tapes\, reading paperbacks\, and capturing light through a camera lens. \nBut beneath his seemingly simple routine lies a life shaped by memory\, mystery\, and choice. As gentle disruptions begin to ripple through his orderly world\, we’re invited into a meditation on solitude\, dignity\, and the invisible richness of everyday existence. \nWenders\, long admired for his contemplative\, human-centered cinema\, draws inspiration from Ozu while offering a rare\, unromanticized view of Tokyo; one that honours its quiet workers and fleeting beauty. With a nostalgic soundtrack and a deeply empathetic gaze\, Perfect Days is a film that lingers long after it ends. \nNominated for Best International Film at the 96th Academy Awards\, this is a cinematic poem for anyone who’s ever found meaning in a daily ritual\, or longed to. \nWim Wenders\, born in 1945\, is a celebrated German filmmaker and a leading voice of New German Cinema. Rising to prominence in the 1970s\, he is known for his deeply human films and visual storytelling across fiction\, documentary\, photography\, and writing. A former film critic and co-founder of Filmverlag der Autoren\, Wenders gained early acclaim with The American Friend and his iconic road movie trilogy. He won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for Paris\, Texas and earned Oscar nominations for Buena Vista Social Club and Pina. His work continues to shape global cinema with emotional depth and artistic innovation. \nThis is the second film in our collaboration with MUBI. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience! \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Three Geniuses from a Little Town
DESCRIPTION:In Karnatik music\, a composer is referred to as a ‘vaggeyakara’ – someone who creates both the text (vak) and the music (geya) for a composition. The kirtana is the most important compositional form in Karnatik music. It is a beautiful balance between the sahitya (text)\, raga (melody) and tala (rhythm). These kirtanas have sprung from the creative flow of melody and text\, thus creating a unified aesthetic identity.  \nThree eighteenth-century composers\, Thyagaraja (1767-1847)\, Muthusvami Dikshithar (1775-1835) and Shyama Shastri (1762-1827)\, were masters and innovators of this compositional form\, reverentially referred to as the ‘Trinity’ of Karnatik music. \nThe oldest among the three\, Shyama Shastri\, composed fewer compositions than his other two contemporaries\, but each one of his compositions stand out as a unique piece. He used complex rhythmic structures which give a special quality to his kirtanas. \nThe prolific composer Thyagaraja viewed ragas with utmost clarity and definition. In his kirtanas\, you find defined nuggets of the raga’s phrases in almost every line. \nThe esoteric Muthusvami Dikshithar looked at a composition with a different lens. His kirtanas are one whole melodic movement where the raga flows in an unstructured manner\, overflowing from one line to another. The deeper one dwells on his compositions\, their beauty unravels. \nAt this concert\, Sangeetha Sivakumar will be presenting compositions of the Trinity with a special focus on Muthusvami Dikshithar since we are celebrating his 250th birth anniversary this year. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Peace Notes - An Evening at the Opera
DESCRIPTION:Experience the drama\, passion\, and romance of opera in a concert featuring timeless masterpieces from Bizet’s Carmen\, Verdi’s La Traviata\, and Gounod’s Romeo and Juliet! \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra will be led by India-born Danish conductor Maria Badstue\, and joined by stellar soloists—Indian-American tenor Alok Kumar and soprano Cheryl Bains. This concert brings the emotional power of grand opera to life in Bengaluru. \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra brings together talented musicians from across the region to foster peace and unity through music. Inspired by Ambassador Nirupama Menon Rao’s extensive years in diplomacy\, the orchestra provides a platform to promote dialogue\, cultural synergy\, and friendly understanding. \nNirupama Rao\, Founder/ Trustee of The South Asian Symphony Foundation says\, “There is something profoundly symbolic about an orchestra. It is more than a group of musicians gathered to perform a piece of music; it is a living metaphor for what society could be — and perhaps what it must be\, if we are to thrive together… This metaphor becomes even more powerful in today’s world\, where individualism often overshadows community\, and noise threatens to replace music. The orchestra reminds us that true greatness lies not in volume\, but in harmony — in listening\, adapting\, and playing our part with care and respect.” \n \n  \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n       \n

SUMMARY:Nehru’s India in the World
DESCRIPTION:Scholars of international relations\, political thought\, and India’s diplomatic history continue to debate the meaning and relevance of non-alignment in India’s foreign policy today. The origins of these debates lie in Jawaharlal Nehru’s articulation of non-alignment at the height of the Cold War\, a concept both resolute and ambiguous. \nIn this talk\, Dr. Swapna Kona Nayudu will draw on her acclaimed book\, The Nehru Years: An International History of Indian Non-Alignment (Cambridge University Press UK\, Juggernaut Books India)\, to explore how India’s approach to international affairs and the United Nations now understood in summary as non-alignment. Based on meticulous archival research in multiple languages\, her work uncovers India’s diplomatic and peacekeeping contributions in pivotal global events such as the Korean War\, the Suez Crisis\, the Hungarian Revolution\, and the Congo Crisis. \nTracing the evolution of non-alignment from Nehru’s time to the present\, Dr. Kona Nayudu will examine its contested meaning and its influence on India’s position as the only non-aligned founding member of the UN. \nDr. Kona Nayudu will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Skandaanubhavam- The World of Blissful Consciousness
DESCRIPTION:Skandaanubhavam – The Inner World of Bliss Consciousness is a humble offering to Lord Muruga – the vibrant Tamil deity and to the literary world that has tried to capture his essence for centuries. This production is an artistic journey through Muruga’s many stories and moods\, as seen through the eyes of poets\, saints\, and seekers. Through the twin disciplines of Harikatha and Bharatanatyam\, we bring to life not only the narratives but the emotions\, dilemmas\, and revelations that these stories carry. Harikatha\, with its flowing rhythm and spoken word\, sets the stage with historical\, philosophical\, and devotional context. Bharatanatyam\, with its gestural beauty and powerful physicality\, takes us deeper into the emotional landscape of the characters. This production is also rooted in the idea of “Atma Anubhava”—the deeply personal\, transformative experiences that poets and composers have shared in their devotion to Lord Muruga. It is these experiences that make ancient stories timeless\, that allow us to feel a 12th-century poet’s longing or a saint’s moment of revelation. \nCredits \nArtistic Director: Acharya Anitha Guha\nResource Consultant & Harikatha: Suchithra B\nVocals: Sriranjani Tapasya Santhanagopalan\nNattuvangam: Jayashree Ramanathan\nMridangam and Rhythmic Composition: Raam Shankar Babu\nViolin: Eashwar Ramakrishnan\nFlute: Sruti Sagar\nMusic Interludes and Jathi Composition: Vijay Kumar\nLighting Design: Surya Rao\nSkandaanubhavam Logo and Invite Design: Avanti Natarajan (Art Brew) \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Driving Elephants
DESCRIPTION:26 minutes | English with subtitles | 2019 \nForests inspire awe\, yet fragmentation\, monocultures\, and urban sprawl disrupt their balance\, driving biodiversity loss and human-elephant conflict (HWC). Elephants\, as ecosystem engineers\, adapt by moving through both wild and cultivated lands\, exposing the blurred lines of modern landscapes. \nSet in regions like Bannerghatta\, Cauvery\, and Mysore\, where A Rocha India works closely with communities and frontline staff\, Driving Elephants documents the fatal consequences faced by free-ranging elephants when they venture into human spaces. Male elephants\, in particular\, are increasingly pushed to the fringes\, navigating traffic\, raiding crops at night\, and forming risky coalitions in search of survival. \nWith over 730 humans and 336 elephants dying annually due to HWC\, this crisis demands more than tolerance; it calls for empathy\, equity\, and space for all. The screening of Driving Elephants is an invitation to reflect on coexistence in these shared landscapes and to reimagine a future where people and elephants can thrive together. \nThe screening will be followed by an audience Q&A session with Avinash Krishnan \n

SUMMARY:The Open Couple
DESCRIPTION:Language: English \nWhen the rules of love are rewritten\, what’s left standing? \nDario Fo’s The Open Couple is a bold\, sharp\, and darkly comic exploration of modern relationships pushed to the edge. What begins as a provocative experiment (a husband proposing an open marriage) quickly spirals into chaos\, confrontation\, and unexpected revelations. \nSet against the backdrop of shifting gender roles and social expectations\, the play peels back the layers of a marriage unravelling. With biting wit and disarming vulnerability\, Fo exposes the emotional toll of jealousy\, the absurdity of control\, and the fragile line between freedom and fear. The couple’s battles are fast\, funny\, and painfully familiar\, as they try to navigate the messy terrain of love\, power\, and identity. \nThrough its rapid dialogue and theatrical twists\, The Open Couple holds up a mirror to our ideas of commitment and connection; asking what we’re really seeking when we ask for more. \nA deeply human comedy that leaves room for both laughter and reckoning. \nCredits:\nWriter : Dario Fo\nDirector : Faraz Khan\nCreative Producer : Ragini Roychowdhury\nActors : Vaishali Bisht & Rohan Joshi\nSound : Charvi Ojha \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Indo-Pacific Outlook: An Australian Perspective
DESCRIPTION:As global power dynamics continue to shift\, the Indo-Pacific sits at the heart of a rapidly evolving strategic and economic landscape. In this timely and wide-ranging session\, Peter Varghese\, former Australian Foreign Secretary and High Commissioner to India\, offers a perspective shaped by decades of diplomacy and deep engagement with the region. \nHis address will explore the complex forces redefining the Indo-Pacific: from the sharpening rivalry between the US and China\, to China’s expanding influence and the evolving policy direction in Washington. The session will also examine how key regional players (India\, Japan\, Korea\, Indonesia) are shaping their own responses to these pressures\, and what this means for the broader security of the region. \nAlongside geopolitics\, the conversation will turn to trade tensions\, economic nationalism\, and the slowing pace of globalization; factors that now cast long shadows over our economic future. Can traditional regional institutions hold\, or will more agile\, interest-based minilateral groups take their place? \nFollowing his presentation\, Peter Varghese will converse with Latha Reddy\, Nitin Pai\, and Ranjan Mathai. The evening concludes with an audience Q&A\, inviting reflections on a region that will shape the 21st century. \n
