SUMMARY:The Thief Who Stole My Heart
DESCRIPTION:This talk commences by introducing the audience to the sacred bronzes created by a master sculptor around the year 1000\, and suggests that his inspiration may well have been child-saint Sambandar’s opening hymn that hails god Shiva as “the thief who stole my heart.” \nVidya Dehejia explores this sensuous imagery before moving to ask questions of this material that have not been asked before. Where did the Cholas acquire the copper required to cast the many temple bronzes that are solid heavy pieces of metal? Why were the Cholas obsessed with island Sri Lanka? What were the circumstances that permitted the creation of hundreds of temples and vast numbers of sacred bronzes despite the constant warfare that the Chola monarchs were engaged in? What was the source of the extraordinarily vast number of pearls that\, together with coral\, rubies and diamonds\, were embedded in gold jewelry gifted to adorn temple bronzes? Why did the Cholas cover the walls of their temple walls with inscriptions– some 13\,000 in total – using temple walls as if they were the public records office? \nA Q&A session with the audience will follow. \n

SUMMARY:शून्यता–समानता | Emptiness–Equality
DESCRIPTION:In this musical introduction to The Notbook of Kabir\, Anand will demonstrate how Kabir often translates and improvises on––and returns to––the Buddha. What is the relationship between Sunnyata (शून्यता\, the void) and Samaanta (समानता\, equality)? How does the raga that is nirgun (निर्गुण)\, beyond form and quality (गुण)\, enfold\, embody and inform form\, and help us experience both being and nothingness? \nFollowing a brief performance\, Anand will be in conversation with Kotiganahalli Ramaiah\, poet\, playwright\, translator and song-writer renowned in the Kannada world. \n

SUMMARY:CycleMahesh
DESCRIPTION:61 minutes | Hybrid Documentary | Odia\, Hindi\, Marathi | 2024 | India\n \nFour years ago\, young worker Mahesh had cycled two thousand kilometres alone to return home during the first lockdown. Now he finds himself the subject of a film being made about his epic journey. But as the shoot comes to an end and Mahesh returns to the maze-like site of his construction job\, the portrait of an endearing young man trapped in his condition emerges. Blending fact and fiction\, this hybrid\, film-within-a-film retells migrant workers’ tales while examining cinema’s cold gaze. \nBut as the film shoot comes to an end\, Mahesh grows desperate. Will he lose friends and home all over again? Is his cinema-dream yet another disappointment? At night he takes off on his cycle. Can he escape one more time? \nThis hybrid\, experimental film-within-a-film\, marries fiction and nonfiction to explore the alienation of a migrant worker India by drawing the portrait of an endearing young man\, trapped in a vicious cycle of disappointments. \nThe innovative film leans on the works of Indian poets like Namdeo Dhasal and Varavara Rao; filmmakers like Abbas Kiarastomi and authors like Franz Kafka to investigate one of India’s most important and underreported social phenomena – migration. \nA conversation with the filmmaker\, Suhel Banerjee and Ekta Mittal will follow the screening. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:ಕನ್ನೇಶ್ವರ ರಾಮ | Kanneshwara Rama
DESCRIPTION:\nKannada with (English Subtitles) | 1977 |118 minutes  \nThrough the untamed wilderness of Karnataka\, an ordinary villager transforms into a defiant outlaw\, having dared to confront British colonial oppression. He leads his band of rebels in their fight for justice and their people’s freedom. \nThis month’s film featured in our informal film club is ಕನ್ನೇಶ್ವರ ರಾಮ | Kanneshwara Rama (1977) \nBased on S. K. Nadig’s novel “Kannayya Rama\,” the 1977 Kannada political film “Kanneshwara Rama” was directed by M. S. Sathyu as his second feature after “Garm Hava.” The film premiered at the International Film Festival of India and achieved both critical and commercial success during its 1989 theatrical release\, completing a 100-day run. The film features an ensemble cast including Anant Nag\, Shabana Azmi (in her Kannada debut)\, and Amol Palekar. \nSet in 1920s India\, the story follows Kanneshwara Rama\, a defiant peasant who becomes a legendary outlaw after confronting local injustice. After a prison stint where he encounters Gandhi’s followers\, he joins and eventually leads a group of bandits\, becoming a Robin Hood-like figure who aids the poor and challenges feudal authority. His journey is complicated by his relationship with Malli\, a former bandit’s mistress\, and his growing ambition to establish his own principality. \nThe film\, which was later screened at the 2017 Bengaluru International Film Festival\, explores themes of rebellion\, justice\, and loyalty against the backdrop of India’s independence movement. Through Rama’s transformation from peasant to folk hero\, it examines the complex relationship between individual leadership and collective causes. \nDirection & Production \n\nDirector: M. S.

SUMMARY:Yogi Mattu Bhogi
DESCRIPTION:90 Minutes | Kannada  \nYogi Mattu Bhogi is a free adaptation of the 7th-century play\, Bhagavadajjukam (Sanskrit\, ‘bhagavat’ – hermit; ‘ajjuka’ – harlot)\, also known in English as The Ascetic and The Courtesan. One of the oldest surviving plays in Sanskrit literature\, it is a fine example of a ‘prahasana’\, or farce. Layered in witty exchanges about dharma\, it is centered around the transmigration of souls between the two titular characters leading to confusion and chaos for the supporting characters who have no answer to the absurdity of it all. \nThrough this retelling in Kannada\, Mahesh Dattani\, plays around with the idea of gender: its expression\, perception\, spectrum and the exploration of what one truly is with a confrontation of stereotypes using humour and catharsis. Infused with Yakshagana\, the play comes alive when the classic Sanskrit text and the physicality of theatre gels seamlessly with the traditional dance theatre form from coastal Karnataka. \nCredits:\nAdaptation and Direction: Mahesh Dattani\nKannada Translation: Vishvajith Madhavamurthy\nYakshagana Choreography: Guru Bannanje Sanjeev Suvarna\nMusic Composition: Poornima Bhojraj\nSet Design: Mahesh Dattani\nLight Design: Trisha Shetty\, Bhavya Bharadwaj\, Pallavi Kodagu\nLights Execution: Trisha Shetty\, Bhavya Bharadwaj\nCostume Design: Shruti Bangera\nMusic: Amrit P\nProduction Manager: Venumadhav Bhat\n(Initial) Poster Design: Gopalkrishna Bhat\n(Initial) Poster Artwork: Shruti Bangera\nAssistant Directors: Trisha Shetty and Kritika Verma\nProduction Assistants: Atharv Mishra and Amrutha \nAbout Punaha Theatre:\nPunaha\, a theatre company based in Udupi\, is dedicated to the art of storytelling through the transformative power of performance. ‘Punaha’\, is derived from the Kannada (Σನಃ)\, Hindi (पुनः) and Sanskrit word\, meaning “repeat\,” or “to do it again”. They are a group of professional theatre artists\, academicians\, and working professionals who love theatre\, and the idea of repetition and riyaaz involved in it. ‘Punaha’ symbolizes their commitment to revisit and reimagine classic narratives while exploring contemporary themes that resonate with today’s audience. It also is the idea of us as humans trying\, failing but definitely starting again\, starting Punaha. Among their ongoing productions are Girish Karnad’s Agni Aur Barkha (translated into Hindi by Ram Gopal Bajaj) and Harold Pinter’s The Caretaker. Agni Aur Barkha was previously adapted to the stage in Kannada as Agni Mattu Male. Yogi Mattu Bhogi is our fourth production overall in collaboration with Sahitya Akademi awardee\, Mahesh Dattani. Punaha hopes to create a thriving theatre culture in the small coastal city of Udupi\, develop their plays thriftily and tour them to other cities\, big and small. Reflecting the multilinguistic atmosphere of the city\, their intention is to not be bound by the constraints of a single language\, producing plays primarily in English\, Hindi\, and Kannada. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Exploring the Temples of the Deccan
DESCRIPTION:Of all regions of India\, the Deccan has the most diverse architectural traditions\, nowhere better shown than in the variety of stone temples sponsored under a succession of dynasties which ruled peninsular India over some 700 years. To illustrate this unique diversity\, Michell explores religious monuments at lesser-known sites. He begins with Early Chalukya temples overlooking the Tungabhadra river at Alampur\, and ends with the imposing Kakatiya monument at the out of the way village of Palampet\, both in Telangana. In between\, he discusses the Nolamaba period shrines at Nandi and Shravana Belgola\, and those of the Later Chalukyas at Sudi\, Kuruvatti and Lakkundi\, all in Karnataka. He concludes with the little visited Hoysala period shrines at Belavadi\, Mosale and Agraha Bachhahalli. \nThe lecture will be followed by a Q&A Session with the audience. \nImage credit – Surendra Kumar \nIn collaboration with:\n  \n

SUMMARY:Agents of Happiness
DESCRIPTION:2024 | 90 minutes | Nepali and Dzongkha with English subtitles | Bhutan/Hungary \nCan you measure happiness? The country of Bhutan invented Gross National Happiness to do just that\, and Amber is one of the agents who travels door to door to meet people and see how they feel. However\, he hasn’t gotten around to measuring his own happiness level. Still living with his mother at the age of 40\, he’s nevertheless a hopeless romantic who dreams of finding love. But as one of the Nepali minority who were deprived of their citizenship\, Amber isn’t the most eligible bachelor. We embark with Amber on his bittersweet journey to encounter Bhutanese from all walks of life. At the end of the road we are reminded of the fragility and beauty of our own happiness. No matter where we live. \nFollowing the screening\, the directors will participate in the discussion\, followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \nProducers: Arun Bhattarai\, Máté Vince\, Noémi Veronika Szakonyi \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:The Earthquake
DESCRIPTION:\n54 minutes | English\, Hindi\, Kannada | Suitable for 13+ Years\nTrigger Warnings: Themes of Loneliness \n\n\n\n\nDo you ever feel alone\, even when surrounded by people? Do you crave connection\, even when it cracks a little? \nMira and Sameer meet every week\, their meeting as familiar as the apple they share. They speak. Someone leaves. They do this again. And again. Mira goes on a boat ride. Sameer stays in a bubble. There is silence. And again. Mira and Sameer are friends… Yet\, their unspoken words scream louder than their conversations. \nThis is a story of cycles. Of coming together\, drifting apart\, and all the spaces in between. \nWhat happens when we finally face our truth? Maybe we hear a strange noise… \nThis is an adaptation of “Bhūmikampa – Das Erdbeben” which received funding for International Cultural Projects from The Department of Arts and Culture of the City of Munich \n\n\nFrom the Playwrights (Samragni Dasgupta and Marvin Krause):\nTwo young artists from India and Germany meet on a farm in Bengaluru as part of an exchange program. They get to know each other and realise that cultural differences are just one aspect of human connection. They come together to develop something together. But what?The idea for this collaboration started with a conversation about loneliness. Above all\, how loneliness is a common factor for young people in all countries. From loneliness to the intricacies of human relationships\, two people began an intensive writing process to explore the many facets of human connection.\n\nFrom the Director:\n“Mira and Sameer find themselves on a bench\, surrounded by unspoken words. ‘The Earthquake’ delves into the essence of human relationships—our connections\, routines\, distances\, and all the spaces in between. It asks us what it means to be truly seen or heard. What happens when we finally face the unspoken truths in our interpersonal relationships?”\n\n\n  \nCredits: \nPlaywrights: Marvin Krause and Samragni Dasgupta\nDirector: Samragni Dasgupta \nCast: \nMira: Yamuna Kali\nSameer: Naman Roy \nThe Earthquake received the Internationaler Kulturprojekte Grant 2023 from the Landeshauptstadt München Kulturreferat (City of Munich). \nProduced by     \n\nWith Support from \n\n \n\n
