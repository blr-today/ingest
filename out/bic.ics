SUMMARY:Freedom and Integrity
DESCRIPTION:There are many different views on what it means to be free. One popular perspective sees freedom as a form of independence: being free means not being held back or restricted by the expectations\, obligations\, or interference from others. After explaining the basic idea in more detail\, the talk discusses Bob Dylan’s work to illustrate the value of this kind of freedom while noting that some other parts of Dylan’s work seem to question this very idea of freedom. To explore the critique of freedom\, the talk turns to Robert Musil’s (1880-1942) unfinished novel The Man Without Qualities. One way to understand this celebrated novel is to see it as a partly hilarious\, partly deeply tragic and moving description of putting too much emphasis on an ideal of freedom as independence. Drawing on insights from moral philosophy\, the talk suggests that a proper understanding of the relation between independence and personal integrity can lead to a better appreciation of freedom as independence. \nA Q&A with the audience will follow the lecture. \nThis lecture is a part of Vidyashilp University’s Public Lecture Series. \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:गीर्वाण वाणी -BHARATHI
DESCRIPTION:Step into a heartfelt journey across time and tradition. In this special performance\, the untouched poetic gems of Mahakavi Subrahmanyam Bharathiyar are brought to life\, exploring the vision and passion behind words he once held close. \nOur story begins with the late Prof. K. V. Krishnan from Varanasi\, Bharathiyar’s own nephew\, whose lifelong love for his uncle’s work unearthed these hidden verses. Through his research\, we glimpse Bharathiyar not only as a poet but as a dreamer\, lighting fires of change. \nThe name Bharathi\, born of the Sanskrit “Abhāyām + Ratah”\, means “one who delights in fearlessness.” This performance honors him as a beacon of courage\, his words as arms of inspiration. \nThis evening offers a warm celebration of dance and verse; a simple yet powerful tribute to our fiery national poet\, whose voice still stirs hearts today. \nCredits \nMusic Direction – Dr. Rajkumar Bharathi\nVocal & Nattuvangam – Swati Athmanathan\nMridangam\, Tabla & Voiceover – Sri.

SUMMARY:A Visual Encyclopedia of Indian Food 
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: 6:00 pm | Friday\, 1 August\nTimings: 11:00 am – 8:00 pm\nExhibition on show until Sunday\, 3 August \nWalkthroughs: \nFriday\, 1 August | 6:30 pm\nSaturday\, 2 August | 12:00 pm & 5:00 pm\nSunday\, 3 August | 11:00 am \nTalk: Sunday\, 3 August | 11:30 am\nIn this conversation between Priya Mani and Elizabeth Yorke\, co-founder of Edible Issues\, A Visual Encyclopedia of Indian Food is explored as a living archive—where ingredients\, tools\, and culinary practices become vessels of memory\, identity\, and heritage. From intergenerational recipes to the shifting ecology of Indian agriculture\, it traces how food connects families and communities across time. It also considers how the sensory experience of food—its taste\, texture\, and smell—can be evoked through image and design\, inviting us to see food not just as nourishment\, but as story\, culture\, and art. \nA feast for the eyes\, the Visual Encyclopedia of Indian Foods is a celebration of India’s edible heritage. \nIn this landmark work\, photographer and storyteller Priya Mani offers an ingredient-led journey through the country’s vast culinary landscape. With images that feel both scientific and sacred\, Mani transforms everyday ingredients into tableaux of cultural history: where grains\, leaves\, spices\, and tools become portraits of memory and meaning. \nFar more than a cookbook or catalog\, the Visual Encyclopedia of Indian Foods weaves together the stories behind what we eat: the seasons that shape our crops\, the tools that grind and stir\, the vessels that hold and serve\, and the communities that grow\, cook\, and share. Each photograph is accompanied by accessible\, insightful text that grounds the visuals in context and highlights connections. \nThis is India’s food story told through form\, color\, and the quiet power of detail.\n \n

SUMMARY:The Nation Wants to Know - A Stand up Special
DESCRIPTION:From Mumbai to New York\, laughter truly needs no visa! \nAnuvab Pal’s The Nation Wants To Know is a fast-paced\, razor-sharp comedic journey through the quirks of modern India\, and how they echo with (or utterly confuse) audiences across the globe. With his signature blend of wit\, warmth\, and wild storytelling\, Anuvab moves from the absurdities of colonial hangovers to the chaotic charm of startups\, social media spats\, and airline adventures. \nThis isn’t just a stand-up show; it’s a cultural joyride. After sold-out performances in 11 countries and 27 cities\, Anuvab now brings back his international tales\, asking: what happens when India’s inside jokes meet the world’s outside gaze? \nPraised as “hysterically funny” by Time Out and “brilliant” by the Hindustan Times\, Anuvab’s satire strikes a chord with audiences of all ages. Whether you’re nostalgic for Doordarshan or deep into meme culture\, his humour finds you and welcomes you in. \nIt’s one evening\, many Indias\, and more than a few unexpected truths as punchlines. \n

SUMMARY:Perfect Days
DESCRIPTION:123 minutes | Japanese with English subtitles | Japan | 2023 \nWriter & Director: Wim Wenders\nScriptwriter: Takuma Takasaki\nStarring: Koji Yakusho\, Tokio Emoto\, Arisa Nakano\, Aoi Yamada\, and others.\nComposer: Patrick Watson \nA quiet life with all its nuances\, beautifully observed. \nLegendary filmmaker Wim Wenders returns to fiction with a luminous story set in the heart of Tokyo\, where the extraordinary hides in plain sight. At its center is Hirayama\, played with quiet brilliance by Cannes 2023 Best Actor Koji Yakusho. He finds peace and purpose in the rhythms of his days: tending to the city’s public toilets\, listening to old cassette tapes\, reading paperbacks\, and capturing light through a camera lens. \nBut beneath his seemingly simple routine lies a life shaped by memory\, mystery\, and choice. As gentle disruptions begin to ripple through his orderly world\, we’re invited into a meditation on solitude\, dignity\, and the invisible richness of everyday existence. \nWenders\, long admired for his contemplative\, human-centered cinema\, draws inspiration from Ozu while offering a rare\, unromanticized view of Tokyo; one that honours its quiet workers and fleeting beauty. With a nostalgic soundtrack and a deeply empathetic gaze\, Perfect Days is a film that lingers long after it ends. \nNominated for Best International Film at the 96th Academy Awards\, this is a cinematic poem for anyone who’s ever found meaning in a daily ritual\, or longed to. \nWim Wenders\, born in 1945\, is a celebrated German filmmaker and a leading voice of New German Cinema. Rising to prominence in the 1970s\, he is known for his deeply human films and visual storytelling across fiction\, documentary\, photography\, and writing. A former film critic and co-founder of Filmverlag der Autoren\, Wenders gained early acclaim with The American Friend and his iconic road movie trilogy. He won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for Paris\, Texas and earned Oscar nominations for Buena Vista Social Club and Pina. His work continues to shape global cinema with emotional depth and artistic innovation. \nThis is the second film in our collaboration with MUBI. Once in two months we will bring a new film from the extensive MUBI collection to our beloved BIC audience! \nIn collaboration with: \n \n

SUMMARY:Three Geniuses from a Little Town
DESCRIPTION:In Karnatik music\, a composer is referred to as a ‘vaggeyakara’ – someone who creates both the text (vak) and the music (geya) for a composition. The kirtana is the most important compositional form in Karnatik music. It is a beautiful balance between the sahitya (text)\, raga (melody) and tala (rhythm). These kirtanas have sprung from the creative flow of melody and text\, thus creating a unified aesthetic identity.  \nThree eighteenth-century composers\, Thyagaraja (1767-1847)\, Muthusvami Dikshithar (1775-1835) and Shyama Shastri (1762-1827)\, were masters and innovators of this compositional form\, reverentially referred to as the ‘Trinity’ of Karnatik music. \nThe oldest among the three\, Shyama Shastri\, composed fewer compositions than his other two contemporaries\, but each one of his compositions stand out as a unique piece. He used complex rhythmic structures which give a special quality to his kirtanas. \nThe prolific composer Thyagaraja viewed ragas with utmost clarity and definition. In his kirtanas\, you find defined nuggets of the raga’s phrases in almost every line. \nThe esoteric Muthusvami Dikshithar looked at a composition with a different lens. His kirtanas are one whole melodic movement where the raga flows in an unstructured manner\, overflowing from one line to another. The deeper one dwells on his compositions\, their beauty unravels. \nAt this concert\, Sangeetha Sivakumar will be presenting compositions of the Trinity with a special focus on Muthusvami Dikshithar since we are celebrating his 250th birth anniversary this year. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Peace Notes - An Evening at the Opera
DESCRIPTION:Experience the drama\, passion\, and romance of opera in a concert featuring timeless masterpieces from Bizet’s Carmen\, Verdi’s La Traviata\, and Gounod’s Romeo and Juliet! \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra will be led by India-born Danish conductor Maria Badstue\, and joined by stellar soloists—Indian-American tenor Alok Kumar and soprano Cheryl Bains. This concert brings the emotional power of grand opera to life in Bengaluru. \nThe South Asian Symphony Orchestra brings together talented musicians from across the region to foster peace and unity through music. Inspired by Ambassador Nirupama Menon Rao’s extensive years in diplomacy\, the orchestra provides a platform to promote dialogue\, cultural synergy\, and friendly understanding. \nNirupama Rao\, Founder/ Trustee of The South Asian Symphony Foundation says\, “There is something profoundly symbolic about an orchestra. It is more than a group of musicians gathered to perform a piece of music; it is a living metaphor for what society could be — and perhaps what it must be\, if we are to thrive together… This metaphor becomes even more powerful in today’s world\, where individualism often overshadows community\, and noise threatens to replace music. The orchestra reminds us that true greatness lies not in volume\, but in harmony — in listening\, adapting\, and playing our part with care and respect.” \n \n  \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n       \n

SUMMARY:Nehru’s India in the World
DESCRIPTION:Scholars of international relations\, political thought\, and India’s diplomatic history continue to debate the meaning and relevance of non-alignment in India’s foreign policy today. The origins of these debates lie in Jawaharlal Nehru’s articulation of non-alignment at the height of the Cold War\, a concept both resolute and ambiguous. \nIn this talk\, Dr. Swapna Kona Nayudu will draw on her acclaimed book\, The Nehru Years: An International History of Indian Non-Alignment (Cambridge University Press UK\, Juggernaut Books India)\, to explore how India’s approach to international affairs and the United Nations now understood in summary as non-alignment. Based on meticulous archival research in multiple languages\, her work uncovers India’s diplomatic and peacekeeping contributions in pivotal global events such as the Korean War\, the Suez Crisis\, the Hungarian Revolution\, and the Congo Crisis. \nTracing the evolution of non-alignment from Nehru’s time to the present\, Dr. Kona Nayudu will examine its contested meaning and its influence on India’s position as the only non-aligned founding member of the UN. \nDr. Kona Nayudu will be in conversation with Jahnavi Phalkey. The discussion will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience. \n

SUMMARY:Un.Divided Identities
DESCRIPTION:Exhibition Opening: 11 am | Wednesday\, 6 Aug\nExhibition Timings: 11 am – 8 pm\nExhibition on show until: 8 pm | Sunday\, 10 Aug \nWalkthroughs:\n4 pm | Saturday\, 9 Aug (followed by a ‘meet the team’ at 5 pm)\n4 pm | Sunday\, 10 Aug \nPartition: Memory\, Responsibility\, and Voice (Panel Discussion): 11 am – 12:30 pm | Saturday\, 9 Aug | Auditorium \nUn.Divided Identities is an interactive choice-based digital exhibition on the 1947 Partition of the Indian subcontinent. Originally launched online in 2022 by ReReeti in partnership with the British Council and Glasgow Life Museums\, this exhibition is now being reimagined as a physical\, immersive experience. It is especially relevant for young people who have only ever encountered Partition through textbook chapters and distorted narratives. \nCurated by ReReeti\, designed by Aditi Dhamija\, and in collaboration with the Bangalore International Centre\, this exhibition urges participants to deeply feel the emotional weight of forced\, mass migration. The digital interactives serve as the core touch point\, but the stories extend beyond the screen. Spilling into the physical space as tactile\, atmospheric\, and visually compelling encounters\, visitors navigate through stories of displacement – stories based on real accounts of families. You will face difficult choices on behalf of characters\, driven by fear\, survival\, and the need to protect their families. \nWhile Partition impacted families across the subcontinent\, its realities are often distant in southern India. This exhibition opens space for reflection and conversation\, prompting visitors to connect personally with questions of identity\, loss\, memory\, and inter-generational resilience. \nThe hope is to change how future generations choose to carry our history forward. \nPlease note: Kids below age 6 will not be allowed inside the Gallery space. \nClick here to know more about the Panel Discussion. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Driving Elephants
DESCRIPTION:26 minutes | English with subtitles | 2019 \nForests inspire awe\, yet fragmentation\, monocultures\, and urban sprawl disrupt their balance\, driving biodiversity loss and human-elephant conflict (HWC). Elephants\, as ecosystem engineers\, adapt by moving through both wild and cultivated lands\, exposing the blurred lines of modern landscapes. \nSet in regions like Bannerghatta\, Cauvery\, and Mysore\, where A Rocha India works closely with communities and frontline staff\, Driving Elephants documents the fatal consequences faced by free-ranging elephants when they venture into human spaces. Male elephants\, in particular\, are increasingly pushed to the fringes\, navigating traffic\, raiding crops at night\, and forming risky coalitions in search of survival. \nWith over 730 humans and 336 elephants dying annually due to HWC\, this crisis demands more than tolerance; it calls for empathy\, equity\, and space for all. The screening of Driving Elephants is an invitation to reflect on coexistence in these shared landscapes and to reimagine a future where people and elephants can thrive together. \nThe screening will be followed by an audience Q&A session with Avinash Krishnan \n

SUMMARY:The Expressive Companion: From Europe to India
DESCRIPTION:Born in Europe and reshaped in Calcutta\, the harmonium arrived in India’s classical music world with baggage: too rigid\, too foreign\, and too limited. Critics called it unfit for the fluidity of Indian ragas. All India Radio banned it for thirty years.  \nAnd yet\, it endured. Its warm\, resonant tones have become the soulful undercurrent to melodious ghazals\, emotional bhajans\, and classical ragas. \nThis evening\, journey through that remarkable evolution with Dr. Ravindra Katoti\, one of India’s leading harmonium maestros\, in conversation with celebrated vocalist Sri Dhananjay Hegde. With Sri Yogesh Bhat on tabla\, they bring alive the stories\, struggles\, and triumphs of this powerful instrument. \nAn evening of sound\, memory\, and musical legacy awaits. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Split Screens
DESCRIPTION:Unlike a painter’s or potter’s studio where you can watch art come alive\, the writer’s creative process is usually hidden\, mysterious\, almost alchemical. Join us for a revelatory evening as we explore Exquisite Cadavers\, Meena Kandasamy’s daring experiment in the “novel-in-the-margins” form. Here\, the story of Maya and Karim — lovers navigating the complexities of migration\, racial identity\, and political uncertainty in Brexit-era London — unfolds alongside the author’s own candid reflections. Kandasamy’s marginalia form a vivid scaffolding around the narrative\, exposing the porous boundaries where life is transformed into fiction. \nThis conversation\, featuring Meena Kandasamy and Samhita Arni\, will delve into the book’s innovative split-screen structure\, where text and context share equal footing and readers are invited to question the very art of reading. Together\, they will discuss how formal experimentation confronts literary expectations\, challenges the marginalization of writers from the Global South\, and connects the intimate landscapes of relationships to broader public histories. Join us and hear how their own experiences shape\, and resist\, the expectations placed on women writers\, and how they transform storytelling into protest\, play\, and polemic. \n

SUMMARY:The Open Couple
DESCRIPTION:Language: English \nWhen the rules of love are rewritten\, what’s left standing? \nDario Fo’s The Open Couple is a bold\, sharp\, and darkly comic exploration of modern relationships pushed to the edge. What begins as a provocative experiment (a husband proposing an open marriage) quickly spirals into chaos\, confrontation\, and unexpected revelations. \nSet against the backdrop of shifting gender roles and social expectations\, the play peels back the layers of a marriage unravelling. With biting wit and disarming vulnerability\, Fo exposes the emotional toll of jealousy\, the absurdity of control\, and the fragile line between freedom and fear. The couple’s battles are fast\, funny\, and painfully familiar\, as they try to navigate the messy terrain of love\, power\, and identity. \nThrough its rapid dialogue and theatrical twists\, The Open Couple holds up a mirror to our ideas of commitment and connection; asking what we’re really seeking when we ask for more. \nA deeply human comedy that leaves room for both laughter and reckoning. \nCredits:\nWriter : Dario Fo\nDirector : Faraz Khan\nCreative Producer : Ragini Roychowdhury\nActors : Vaishali Bisht & Rohan Joshi\nSound : Charvi Ojha \nSupported by:\n \n

SUMMARY:Sounds from the Library (#4)
DESCRIPTION:Sounds From The Library returns for its fourth edition! \nAn intimate evening where conversation and performance intertwine in the cozy\, listener-focused space of the BIC library. This hybrid series spotlights emerging voices from the Indian music scene\, all past longlisted artists from the Toto Awards for Music. \nThis edition hosts Krameri from Vadodara\, who brings a moody\, atmospheric blend of electro\, dance\, and alt-pop\, a soundscape that’s as textured as it is emotional.

SUMMARY:Partition: Memory\, Responsibility & Voice
DESCRIPTION:How do we honour truths without exploitation or erasure? \nThis panel discussion will explore how the chapter of Partition is remembered\, who holds the responsibility of preserving its stories\, and what it means to give them an honest voice. Through literature\, oral testimony\, archives\, or immersive media\, each speaker has engaged with histories marked by silence\, trauma\, and survival. In this session\, they will reflect on the choices they have made: to amplify certain voices\, to tell different stories with care\, and to avoid reducing complex truths into simplified narratives. \nAt the heart of this conversation is a shared responsibility; not only as writers\, educators\, or artists\, but as individuals shaped by inherited memory. As Partition fades from lived memory\, this panel asks how the stories we carry today might shape the understanding of future generations\, and the ways they remember\, question\, and imagine. \nIn collaboration with:\n \n

SUMMARY:The Indo-Pacific Outlook: An Australian Perspective
DESCRIPTION:As global power dynamics continue to shift\, the Indo-Pacific sits at the heart of a rapidly evolving strategic and economic landscape. In this timely and wide-ranging session\, Peter Varghese\, former Australian Foreign Secretary and High Commissioner to India\, offers a perspective shaped by decades of diplomacy and deep engagement with the region. \nHis address will explore the complex forces redefining the Indo-Pacific: from the sharpening rivalry between the US and China\, to China’s expanding influence and the evolving policy direction in Washington. The session will also examine how key regional players (India\, Japan\, Korea\, Indonesia) are shaping their own responses to these pressures\, and what this means for the broader security of the region. \nAlongside geopolitics\, the conversation will turn to trade tensions\, economic nationalism\, and the slowing pace of globalization; factors that now cast long shadows over our economic future. Can traditional regional institutions hold\, or will more agile\, interest-based minilateral groups take their place? \nFollowing his presentation\, Peter Varghese will converse with Latha Reddy\, Nitin Pai\, and Ranjan Mathai. The evening concludes with an audience Q&A\, inviting reflections on a region that will shape the 21st century. \n

SUMMARY:Music of the Kirana Gharana
DESCRIPTION:A single note can carry centuries of devotion. \nThe Kirana Gharana tradition of Hindustani classical music reveals itself slowly. Like dawn breaking across a silent sky\, it is characterised by a meditative approach. Known for its graceful meend (glides) and evocative sargams (musical phrases)\, this musical evening invites deep listening and quiet awe. \nAcclaimed vocalist Pandit Milind Chittal brings the essence of this lineage to life. With his masterful control and emotive phrasing\, he leads audiences through the delicate unfolding of ragas\, where each swara (note) holds a world of feeling\, and every silence has meaning. \nThis is more than a performance; it’s a conversation across time\, held in melody and breath. \nLet the music find its way to where words cannot reach. \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Aah! Aha! Ha-ha!
DESCRIPTION:Are we teaching children what to think\, or how to think? When our children focus on rote learning and exam-based academic progress\, how do we nurture the inventive Indian who can fuel the imagination of the world with creativity\, critical thinking and problem-solving? What if classrooms became labs of imagination\, not factories of repetition? \nThese are the questions that the Agastya International Foundation set out to answer 25 years ago\, by designing a curiosity-driven\, experiential learning model that has transformed education across India. Today\, their vision of sparking curiosity\, nurturing creativity and instilling confidence and caring has impacted over 25 million schoolchildren and 300\,000 teachers in government schools across 23 Indian States. \nAn acclaimed new book from Penguin Random House\, The Moving of Mountains traces Agastya’s extraordinary journey in reshaping the classroom by replacing rote learning with hands-on experiments\, creative projects and interactive models in science\, art and ecology. \nJoin us in a discussion of why this powerful vision for curiosity-driven\, experiential learning is critical to the future of India\, and has caught the imagination of scientists\, industry leaders\, educationists and policy makers alike. \nThe discussion will be followed by a Q&A session. \n

SUMMARY:Mosaics of Motion
DESCRIPTION:A dancer performing is akin to ink on paper\, both embody the timeless art of storytelling. Utilising the medium of the stage to express the chosen character’s emotions\, histories\, and the many lives they have lived\, Ballet emanates from the vocabulary of movement and strives to depict these layered tales. The stage comes alive with the confluence of years of practice and the timeless ambition to share stories within communities. \nThe National Youth Ballet company will present a selection of Pas Seuls (solo variations) and ensemble pieces that transcend the test of time to bring forth emotions and true artistry. The evening is curated to understand layered characters like Swanhilda from Coppelia\, the Lilac Fairy from Sleeping Beauty\, Sylvia from the eponymous ballet\, exploring the Tea dance from the Nutcracker\, a Jazz Waltz rendering the momentum of fire\, and culminating in excerpts from The Cave of Wonders from Aladdin The Ballet\, The Lewis Foundation of Classical Ballet’s forthcoming production. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nSupported by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Confessions of a Lobbyist
DESCRIPTION:Insider accounts from political aides\, bureaucrats\, and diplomats have long illuminated the workings of power—but even more enigmatic were the lobbyists. Operating in the shadows\, often invisible to public scrutiny\, they were intimately privy to clandestine negotiations\, back-channel discussions\, and subtle bureaucratic skirmishes. In his new roman-à-clef For No Reason At All\, Ramjee Chandran shines a light on this hidden world. \nChandran—well‑known in Bangalore as a journalist\, publisher\, and podcaster—has\, until now\, remained silent about his time as a lobbyist in 1980s New Delhi\, a pivotal era just before major economic reforms took hold. \nDrawing from real events\, the novel charts the journey of a young lobbyist caught in a high-stakes conflict over silicon metal—a material deemed strategically vital. Central to the drama is Metkem Silicon\, which\, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore\, devoted 17 years to developing indigenous silicon metal technology. Yet their efforts collided with a rival scheme spearheaded by the Department of Electronics\, which wanted to bypass local innovation and import U.S. technology. \nWhat ensued was a four‑year bureaucratic war: media leaks\, secret memorandums\, and the covert involvement of the Soviets and other intelligence agencies—culminating in a final decision placed in the hands of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. \nSet against the backdrop of Cold War Delhi on the cusp of liberalisation\, the novel paints a vivid portrait of a nation—and capital—torn between ideologies and ambitions. The Soviet Union may have vanished\, lobbyists have receded from public corridors\, and few can claim first‑hand knowledge of that era. \nIn Confessions of a Lobbyist\, Siddharth Raja—a lawyer\, historian\, and bibliophile—sits down with Ramjee Chandran to peel back the layers of this story\, offering an insider’s glimpse into a world that feels at once distant and disarmingly relevant. \n
