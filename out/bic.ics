SUMMARY:Pravāha 2026
DESCRIPTION:Born from a vision to unite masters and experimentalists on a single stage\, Pravāha debuted in 2024. The second edition of this festival\, The Body As Space\, explores how we experience the world through sight\, sound\, touch\, taste\, and smell. \nOver eight days\, the festival becomes a journey through sensation. Classical melodies meet olfactory landscapes. Contemporary dance transforms into tactile dialogue. Installations immerse you in sound\, scent\, and memory itself. Conversations uncover India’s forgotten sensory archives and trace the origins of instruments that changed how we listen. \nWe invite you to tune into what you’ve always carried: the intelligence of your body\, the stories held in your senses. \nRSVP for the events you’d like to attend here. \nFestival Schedule: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\nArtist\nNature\nTimings\n\n\nFeb 22 – Mar 1\nHistories of Indian Perfume\nOn a Scented Trail\nThe Marg Foundation\nExhibition\n11am – 9pm\n\n\nFeb 22 – Mar 1\nFirst-Hand\nA Multisensorial Pause for Rest\, Attention\, and Care\nFor Ages 15+\nNitish Jain\nPaticipatory Immersive Experience\nFeb 22 – 11am\, 3pm\, 7pm\nFeb 23 – 3pm\, 7pm\nFeb 24 – 3pm\, 7pm\nFeb 25 – 3pm\, 7pm\nFeb 26 – 3pm\, 7pm\nFeb 27 – 3pm\, 7pm\nFeb 28 – 11am\, 3pm\, 7pm\nMar 1 – 11am\, 3pm\, 7pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nVāsané\nOlfactory Archives of Bangalore\nIndu Antony\nLecture Demonstration\n11:30am – 1pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nGrounded: A Food and Body Coffee Lab\nA Sensorial Exploration of Coffee\, Memory\, and Land\nShubhra Chatterji\nWorkshop\n4pm – 6:30pm\n\n\nFeb 22\nTHOL\nReconstructing Tamil Antiquity Through Revived Instruments and Contemporary Songwriting\nUrupaanar\nPerformance\n7pm – 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 23\nCall of the Flute\nA Coming Together of Pichwai Paintings\, Kuchipudi Dance\, and Flute\nAmrita Lahiri\, Shan Bhatnagar & Hrishikesh Majumdar\nPerformance\n7pm – 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 24\nNotes That Linger\nSounds and Scents Mingling in the Evening Air\nKarl Lutchmayer\nImmersive Performance\n7pm – 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 25\nThe Far Post\nPhysical Theatre With Masks\, Puppetry and Music\nFor Ages 12+\nYuki Ellias\, Priyanshu Gupta\, Sumaiya Merchant\, Mati Rajput\, Arnob Bal\, Phalguni Vittal Rao\, Priyanka Babbar & Sanket Parkhe\nPerformance\n7pm – 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 26\nNavrasa and I\nReliving the Rasas Through Raagas\nIndrayuddh Majumdar & Roopak Kallurkar\nPerformance\n7pm – 9pm\n\n\nFeb 27\nA Woman Or Not to Be\nA Bold Reimagining of Shakespeare’s Hamlet Through the Eyes of a Woman\nFor Ages 12+\nAdishakti Laboratory for Theatre Art Research\nPerformance\n7pm – 8:30pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nThe Percussive Pathway\nA Brief Foray into the Wondrous World of Percussion\nRahul Vanamali\nInteractive Performance & Workshop\n11am\n12:30pm\n2:30pm\n4:30pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nMaking the Ephemeral\nHistories of Indian Perfume\nJames McHugh\, Giti Datt & Ahalya Matthan\nDiscussion\n11:30am – 1pm\n\n\nFeb 28\nKadahin Milandaasin |\nڪڏهن ملنداسين\nA Jazz Quartet Weaving Memory into Music\nTarun Balani\, Sonja Ott\, Siddharth Gautam & Luke Marantz\nPerformance\n7pm – 8:30pm\n\n\nMar 1\nFuture Food Taste Test\nWhat’s in Our Climate Pantry?\nEdible Issues\nWorkshop\n4pm – 6pm\n\n\nMar 1\nAbhijñānaśākuntalam: The Circle of Love\nA Kūṭiyāṭṭam Performance Where Love Blossoms\nNepathya\nPerformance\n7pm – 9pm\n\n\n\nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:First-Hand
DESCRIPTION:First-hand. First\, Hand. \nAn experience that begins with the hand\, with touch. The most direct sense through which we connect with the world. \nBlindfolded\, headphones on\, you’re guided through forests\, seas\, and desert plains for 90 minutes. The world arrives through your fingertips: unexpected textures and sensations that reorient you. Your hands doing the work your eyes usually do. Through evocative storytelling\, you traverse sensory worlds shaped by the intelligence and wonder of the animal kingdom. \nAn invitation to attune yourself differently. To recalibrate away from the visual tyranny of screens and return to your body’s older\, quieter ways of knowing the natural world. \nPlease Note: Limited to 10 participants per session. \nSession Schedule:\nSun\, Feb 22 | 11am\, 3pm & 7pm\nMon\, Feb 23 | 3pm & 7pm\nTue\, Feb 24 | 3pm & 7pm\nWed\, Feb 25 | 3pm & 7pm\nThu\, Feb 26 | 3pm & 7pm\nFri\, Feb 27 | 3pm & 7pm\nSat\, Feb 28 | 11am\, 3pm & 7pm\nSun\, Mar 1 | 11am\, 3pm & 7pm \nProduction Credits:\nCreated by: Nitish Jain in collaboration with Studio MoreThanThat\nDramaturgy: Mara Ingea\, Katja Vaghi\, Anne Decker and Bhaskar Singh Thakur\nMusic: Raaghav Dhingra\nNarration: Anushri Patel\nCostumes: Emmanouela Mastora\, GulSohrab Studio\nArtists: Bhaskar Singh Thakur\, Zaid Khan\, Anukriti Mishra and Nitish Jain\nProduced by: Studio MoreThanThat\nCommissioned by: Rohini Nilekani Philanthropies\nThe project is made possible with the financial support of: Aparna Piramal Raje; Nova Sit (Czech Cultural Network); Studio Alta\, Prague; Scouts Institute Prague; Surnadal Billag AS\, Norway; Centro Jobel\, Italy; and Culture Moves Europe\, Belgium. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:Histories of Indian Perfume
DESCRIPTION:Scent carries memory. \nThe smell of ripe mangoes transports you to childhood summers. Rose attar takes you to a Nawab’s palace you never visited. \nThis exhibition traces the histories of perfume in India through texts\, paintings\, records\, and objects left behind. Map how scent entered cuisine\, medicine\, worship. Follow trade routes that carried oils and essences across continents. Discover who made perfume\, how it was distilled\, where labor and craft intersect with commerce and ritual. \nIn collaboration with MARG Magazine\, the exhibition culminates in a conversation with James McHugh\, Giti Datt\, and Ahalya Matthan on Sat\, Feb 28\, 11:30am. Link to the session here. \nImage and text. Scent and history. \nWalkthroughs: \nTue\, Feb 24 – 4 PM\nThu\, Feb 26 – 4 PM\nSat\, Feb 28 – 3 PM \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:Call of the Flute
DESCRIPTION:A dark body draped in yellow. Flower garland\, peacock feather. You know the image. \nWhen Lord Krishna plays his flute\, everything bends toward that sound. The cow freezes mid-graze\, standing on one leg. The gopi stops mid-task. The lotus pauses mid-bloom. For centuries\, Indian artists have followed that call. \nPichwai comes from Rajasthan’s temple havelis\, worship made visible on cloth. Kuchipudi from Andhra’s villages\, stories told through the body. Opposite ends of India\, both Vaishnavite traditions holding the same images sacred. \nTogether on stage is an unlikely trio: Pichwai painter Shan Bhatnagar\, Kuchipudi dancer Amrita Lahiri\, flautist Hrishikesh Majumdar. Each devoted to their form\, each form devoted to Krishna. Bhatnagar walks you through his paintings between dance pieces. Lahiri responds\, those frozen moments coming alive through movement. Majumdar’s flute ties it together\, the sound that makes devotion inevitable. \nNorth and South. Stillness and motion. The call and the answer. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Notes That Linger
DESCRIPTION:A performance of Western classical music. But not quite your traditional piano recital. \nThe pieces are famous. Debussy\, Scarlatti\, Liszt\, Grieg\, Brahms\, Sorabji\, Copland. You may have heard some of them before. That is the point. Repetition does not preserve meaning\, it changes it. The same notes\, heard again\, evoke different emotions. \nEach piece arrives with a scent. The music reaches you through the ear. The fragrance reaches you somewhere you can’t quite name. Between the two\, something surfaces: the specific\, vivid kind of memory that belongs only to you. \nWoven through is a conversation about music\, scent and sensation: how memory is invoked without words\, without warning\, without intention. \nThe piano is waiting. \n \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \nSupported by: \n    Contact        \n

SUMMARY:The Far Post
DESCRIPTION:Nobody said the afterlife would be fair. \nTwo enemy soldiers die in battle and find themselves at the same border crossing into the afterlife. The officer in charge is a Postman Aunty with a pet goldfish and a makeshift post office that serves both sides of the conflict equally. As the soldiers navigate what comes next\, letters from the war begin to surface. Masks shift\, puppets move\, bodies speak. \nDirector Yuki Ellias built a show without words\, letting movement do the work. Sofiyum\, a Sikkimese band\, fills the stage with music that weaves Lepcha folk traditions into something entirely its own. The songs\, created in Lepcha with the Dur See Brothers\, give the show a sound world as specific and ethereal as its setting. \nCold mountains. A border cutting through no man’s land. A goldfish. And somewhere in the middle of all of it\, peace feels close\, just like a spring morning. \nProduction Credits:\nStory\, Direction\, Actor: Yuki Ellias\nActor\, Choreographer: Tapas Boro\nMusic and Sound: Sofiyum Band: Mickma Tshering Lepcha\, Ongyal Tshering Lepcha\, Noel J.

SUMMARY:Navrasa and I
DESCRIPTION:Nine rasas. Nine ragas. \nIndrayuddh Majumdar has spent years mapping the fundamental human emotions onto the traditional ragas built to hold them. Trained in the Senia Maihar gharana\, he knows where shringar lives in a phrase\, where karuna turns\, where shanta finally settles. \nHe walks us through that map. Each rasa has a story\, and each story\, a raga. With Roopak Kallurkar on tabla\, not much is left unsaid. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:A Woman Or Not to Be
DESCRIPTION:You know this story. \nA death in the royal family. A ghost with demands. A protagonist tipping toward madness\, or something that looks like it. Revenge as the only logical conclusion. \nPut a woman in the centre. The axis shifts. \nDoes the ghost get believed? Does the grief get room\, or a diagnosis? And what happens when the ghost doesn’t ask for revenge at all\, but tells her daughter to protect herself through education? \nPrincess Hamlet is twenty\, home from college\, fluent in manga and martial arts\, and entirely unprepared for what her mother’s ghost is asking of her. Adishakti’s production departs sharply from Shakespeare\, and in that departure\, asks what we’ve always taken for granted about grief\, power\, and who gets to act on either. \nWritten\, adapted and directed by Vinay Kumar. Nimmy Raphel plays a Hamlet the original never imagined. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:The Percussive Pathway
DESCRIPTION:Sound hits your eardrums. Percussion resonates through your entire body. \nPercussionist Rahul Vanamali starts there. He walks you through two instruments: the vibraphone and the snare drum. Their histories and techniques. Then works that have never been performed in India. Pieces that pull sounds you didn’t know these instruments could make. \nThen he hands you the sticks. \nYou’ll feel how a whisper-touch on a drum head creates depth. How striking the same bar in different spots shifts the tone. Sound\, yes. But also vibration traveling up your arms\, the hum settling in your ribs. After that\, the room plays together. Rahul has arranged ensemble passages that work even if you’ve never held a mallet before. Sync with strangers into a rhythm you can feel in the floor. \nRahul spent years discovering these instruments\, jolted by wonder when sound became something physical. It is your turn now! \nPlease Note: Limited to 20 participants per session. \nSession Schedule:\n11am – 12noon\n12:30pm – 1:30pm\n2:30pm – 3:30pm\n4:30pm – 5:30pm \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses.

SUMMARY:Making the Ephemeral
DESCRIPTION:Scent travels across time. You just don’t think about it that way. \nA whiff of jasmine connects you to rituals performed two thousand years ago. Sandalwood routes that crossed continents. Rose attar distilled using techniques older than most written records. Perfume holds ecology\, trade\, memory\, and craft in a single drop. \nJames McHugh lectures on smell in early Indian religion and culture. How scent functioned in ritual. How aromatics were understood\, classified\, traded across ancient networks. Then\, a conversation with Bengaluru-based perfumer Ahalya Matthan and anthropologist-perfumer Giti Datt. They work with traditional attars\, the concentrated fragrances India has been making for centuries. You’ll hear about the science behind distillation\, the artistry in blending\, the labor in every bottle. \nHistory\, distilled. \nThe session will be followed by a walkthrough of the Histories of Indian Perfume exhibition by James McHugh at 3pm. \nImage credits: \nThumbnail – Full bhapkas sitting in the corner of a distillery\, so that the distillate can settle overnight.

SUMMARY:Kadahin Milandaasin | ڪڏهن ملنداسين
DESCRIPTION:Some homelands you’ve never seen\, but you long for them anyway. \nComposer and drummer Tarun Balani never set foot in Sindh. Yet he knows it through his grandmother’s stories\, through words in a half-remembered language\, through melodies that surfaced decades after Partition. \nThe Tarun Balani Quartet features trumpeter Sonja Ott\, guitarist Siddharth Gautam\, pianist Luke Marantz. Four musicians from four countries playing music about belonging nowhere and everywhere at once. Contemporary jazz meets Sindhi folk. Improvisation meets tradition. The sound shifts the way memory does when you try to hold it still. \nFamily archives and oral histories thread through the performance. Live improvisation responds to what the room holds. You’ll be invited to offer something: a memory\, a word in a language slipping away\, an image of a place you carry. The quartet takes it in. Lets it shape the music. What you share stays\, becomes part of what everyone else hears. \nKadahin Milandaasin. When will we meet? \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Future Food Taste Test
DESCRIPTION:\nWho decided what tastes right? And who taught you what’s worth eating? \nClimate is rewriting the menu. What grows\, what travels\, and what survives the heat. Ingredients that are arriving because the world is shifting. Some adapted\, some unfamiliar. \nEdible Issues opens their climate pantry to you. Tasting in a sensory lab for a changing food future. You’ll sample items found during their fieldwork: ingredients showing up as ecosystems shift. A chance to slow down and pay attention to flavor\, texture\, aftertaste. The emotional response that arrives before you can explain it. \nBetween samples\, a conversation about the forces that built your palate. Markets that decided okra is rustic and asparagus is refined. Media that taught you which bitterness counts as sophisticated. The preferences you inherited\, questioned. \nThe ingredients are here. The verdict is yours. \n\nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nIn collaboration with: \n \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Abhijñānaśākuntalam: The Circle of Love
DESCRIPTION:Kālidāsa never met Kūṭiyāṭṭam. Until now. \nNepathya presents a scene from Abhijñānaśākuntalam\, Kālidāsa’s most celebrated play: the moment when Duṣyanta and Śakuntalā meet and fall in love. Conceived and designed by Guru Margi Madhu Chakyar\, this adaptation brings together what history kept apart. \nIn this adaptation\, the Sūta enacts Duṣyanta’s actions. Duṣyanta mirrors the deer. His responses echo Śakuntalā’s movements. What emerges is emotions synchronizing across bodies\, a complementary interplay that grew from attempting the impossible. \nKūṭiyāṭṭam stretches time. A gesture can last minutes. A glance becomes an entire emotional landscape. What you see is intensity\, immediacy\, and a particular kind of attention. \nKālidāsa. Kūṭiyāṭṭam. They meet at last. \nPart of Pravāha 2026\, The Body As Space: A Journey Through The Senses. This year’s festival is built around what we hear\, smell\, touch\, taste\, and see. Eight days of multisensory experiences through classical music\, contemporary dance\, installations\, and conversations. \nPresented by: \n \n

SUMMARY:Design\, Skills\, and Transcontinental Flair
DESCRIPTION:For over forty years\, legendary British designer Dame Zandra Rhodes and Indian design visionary Rajeev Sethi have shared a rare creative partnership rooted in friendship\, curiosity\, and cross-cultural exchange. From the landmark Festival of India exhibitions to collaborations with artisans across the subcontinent\, their work has reimagined how traditional craft\, contemporary design\, and global aesthetics can meet. \nIn this special conversation\, Rhodes and Sethi reflect on journeys through India’s textile traditions\, experiments that bridged craft and couture\, and the communities of makers whose skills shaped their work. They will discuss the evolving role of design in sustaining cultural heritage\, the transformative power of collaboration\, and the personal bond that has sustained their creative dialogue across decades. \nRich with stories of travel\, experimentation\, and shared vision\, this session offers a rare glimpse into a friendship that helped reshape global conversations around craft\, fashion\, and cultural diplomacy. \nImages:\nThumbnail\, Header and Poster: Early photographs of Zandra Rhodes and Rajeev Sethi preparing for the Festival of India in 1981. \n
