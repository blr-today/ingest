    "description": "A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF A HOUSEWIFE\u2019S QUEST FOR INTELLECTUAL GROWTH AND HER ABILITY TO RESIST TWENTIETH-CENTURY ORTHODOXIES IN MADRAS VIA WRITING AND READING. In this intimate, yet simultaneously anthropological, exploration of the life of her maternal grandmother Pankajam (1911\u20132007), Kalpana Karunakaran achieves the remarkable: capturing the singularity of an exceptional woman, even as it situates her in a social universe shaped by the conventions of Tamil Brahmin orthodoxy. Karunakaran conveys with clarity how the \u2018utterly ordinary\u2019 life of a \u2018woman of no consequence\u2019 (as Pankajam writes of herself), lived out largely within the confines of family and kin, was quite far from ordinary. The book draws extensively upon letters, glimpses of Pankajam\u2019s life narrated through her thinly-disguised semi-autobiographical short stories that allowed her to \u2018say the unsayable\u2019 about love, intimacy and conjugality, and her autobiography, which she began writing in 1949 and kept writing till her last piece in 1995. What comes together is a riveting portrait of heartbreak and violence, yearning and delight, a housewife\u2019s quest for intellectual growth and her talent for friendships across cultures and continents. In the final reckoning, A Woman of No Consequence is about the chequered trajectories of a newly-born nation as seen through the lens of its daughters\u2014restless women forcing home and nation to reckon with their stubborn striving for self-actualisation.",

Journeying through the ambience of the 1996 December Season, being with artists, before/during/after their performances, the film attempts to portray the very essence of the culture that prevails during the Season. FILMMAKER AND HIS MOTIVATION: R.V. Ramani, is an Award-winning filmmaker, makes films exploring various aspects of expression, in a candid, explorative and deeply subjective approach. With more than 30 independent films to his credit, he is created a niche for himself, in the Documentary/Avant- garde films in India. On the film \u2018Season\u2019 he says, \u2018The idea for \u2018Season\u2019, probably began after hearing the concert by flautist T. Vishwanathan (Vishwa), in 1989. His music and presence deeply moved me, especially in the way he transforms a performance space into an intimate space. When he received his Sangita Kalanidhi award in 1996, I felt compelled to film with him and also journey through the ambience of the Season, filming with many artists.\u201d FEATURED ARTISTES: Vishwanathan T, Vidhya Sridhar , Unnikrishnan, Sudha Raghunathan, Srilatha Suresh, Sowmya S, Sikkil Sisters, Shobana, Seshagopalan TN , Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer , Sashank MS, Sanjay Subramaniam, Ravikiran N, Neiveli Santanagopalan, Leela Samson, Lakshmi Knight, Krishna TM, Kelucharan Mahapatra, Kanyakumari A , Kadri Gopalnath , Gayathri E , Chitra Visweswaran, Bombay Jayashree, Balamurali Krishna, Aruna Sayeeram, Anita Ratnam, Amjad Ali Khan and many more.",
