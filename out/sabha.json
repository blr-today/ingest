    "description": "Archaeological Landscapes and Heritage Monuments: Contextualizing the Long-Term History of Maski Dr. Bauer will present findings from over 20 years of archaeological research in northern Karnataka, focusing on the long-term history of Maski (Raichur District)\u2014known for its Ashokan Edict and earlier occupations\u2014and the megalithic site of Hire Benakal (Koppal District). His talk explores how these sites are understood within the broader cultural landscapes of ancient activities and practices.  Andrew Bauer, an anthropological archaeologist at Stanford University, conducts research in South India examining how landscape history, cultural practices, and social inequalities evolved from the Neolithic to the Medieval periods. He also explores how landscape histories intersect with modern ideas of nature, conservation, and climate change.",

On the film \u2018Season\u2019 he says, \u2018The idea for \u2018Season\u2019, probably began after hearing the concert by flautist T. Vishwanathan (Vishwa), in 1989. His music and presence deeply moved me, especially in the way he transforms a performance space into an intimate space. When he received his Sangita Kalanidhi award in 1996, I felt compelled to film with him and also journey through the ambience of the Season, filming with many artists.\u201d FEATURED ARTISTES: Vishwanathan T, Vidhya Sridhar , Unnikrishnan, Sudha Raghunathan, Srilatha Suresh, Sowmya S, Sikkil Sisters, Shobana, Seshagopalan TN , Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer , Sashank MS, Sanjay Subramaniam, Ravikiran N, Neiveli Santanagopalan, Leela Samson, Lakshmi Knight, Krishna TM, Kelucharan Mahapatra, Kanyakumari A , Kadri Gopalnath , Gayathri E , Chitra Visweswaran, Bombay Jayashree, Balamurali Krishna, Aruna Sayeeram, Anita Ratnam, Amjad Ali Khan and many more.",
