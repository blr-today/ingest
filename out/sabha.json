    "description": "BLR Hubba is the city's premier arts and culture festival, celebrating its diversity across genres such as dance, music, theatre, art, food and more. Anchored by UnboxingBLR, the festival returns for its latest edition between 16-25 January 2026. Since we last came together, the city had one less metro line and no IPL trophy. A lot has changed, and with each passing year the reasons to celebrate only grow. BLR Hubba adds to that spirit by creating multiple, genre-agnostic ways to pause, reflect, and celebrate. Over the past few years, historic landmarks like Vidhana Soudha and Freedom Park have come alive with music, theatre, dance, poetry, and genre-defying performances for the Hubba. This year, too, new venues, fresh themes, and countless experiences await. Bengaluru is known across the world for its start-ups, gardens and lakes, science and engineering, and of course, its traffic. BLR Hubba draws from all these identities, bringing people together to celebrate the city in all its complexity. Banni Nodi. Come, see for yourself what makes Bengaluru's festival of festivals.",
