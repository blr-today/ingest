On the film \u2018Season\u2019 he says, \u2018The idea for \u2018Season\u2019, probably began after hearing the concert by flautist T. Vishwanathan (Vishwa), in 1989. His music and presence deeply moved me, especially in the way he transforms a performance space into an intimate space. When he received his Sangita Kalanidhi award in 1996, I felt compelled to film with him and also journey through the ambience of the Season, filming with many artists.\u201d FEATURED ARTISTES: Vishwanathan T, Vidhya Sridhar , Unnikrishnan, Sudha Raghunathan, Srilatha Suresh, Sowmya S, Sikkil Sisters, Shobana, Seshagopalan TN , Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer , Sashank MS, Sanjay Subramaniam, Ravikiran N, Neiveli Santanagopalan, Leela Samson, Lakshmi Knight, Krishna TM, Kelucharan Mahapatra, Kanyakumari A , Kadri Gopalnath , Gayathri E , Chitra Visweswaran, Bombay Jayashree, Balamurali Krishna, Aruna Sayeeram, Anita Ratnam, Amjad Ali Khan and many more.",
