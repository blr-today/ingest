    "description": "The Craft Council of Karnataka conducted a very successful two month long intensive Design Department Workshop in the months of June- August. This was done in the Kinhal village, Koppal.  Moving beyond skill training, the focus was on design intervention- adding finesse and a contemporary twist to the traditional Kinhal painted woodcraft!  \n These pieces are being showcased at Sabha on the 24th of September.  An Illustrated Talk by Ms. Geetha Rao (Former Chairperson, The Crafts Council of Karnataka) at 5:00 pm Please drop in, all are welcome!",
