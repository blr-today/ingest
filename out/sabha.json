    "description": "Varnam Craft Collective, known for reviving and reimagining the Channapatna toy craft from Karnataka for the last 14 years, is launching it\u2019s biggest craft collaboration yet.  The Snugglewalas - Storytellers of Handmade India, is a first-of-its-kind showcase where whimsical toys tell the story of India\u2019s handmade crafts, all the way from Kashmir to Karnataka. This multi-city exhibition will travel through India to showcase the variety of handmade crafts reimagined in ways that are accessible to children and adults, in the form of toys, clothes, home accents, jewelry and Collectibles. Whether you\u2019re an adult or a child, you\u2019ll fall in love with the Snugglewalas - toys with delightful personalities, just like each of us. Meet Snappy the Crocodile, the gentle riverkeeper who loves floating spas and calm waters, Dawnold the Rooster who reminds us that everyday is a new start and Neckles the Giraffe, the family\u2019s fashion icon who exudes poise and quiet elegance, and many more whimsical characters. The Snugglewalas: More than just toys A Snugglewala is not just a fluffy creature with soft paws and warm hugs. It is a feeling, a quiet, gentle reminder that comfort exists, that love can be as simple as a cuddle, as effortless as being near. A Snugglewala is the soft embrace of home, the quiet joy of unwinding, the feeling of being cradled by something similar and kind. The Snugglewalas are India\u2019s first-of-its-kind exploration where toys transform into storytellers and design meets craft in playful and unexpected ways.  Born from the 200-year-old toy craft of Channapatna, the Snugglewalas are a whimsical caravan of storytellers, journeying across the country from Kashmir to Karnataka, with tales tucked inside their wooden forms. Each one is a playful companion, yet also a custodian of India\u2019s craft traditions - carrying with them the voices of artisans, the colors of regions and the timeless spirit of design. Together, they are more than toys, they are narrators of heritage, weaving stories of craft and culture into the hearts of all who meet them. Unlike the usual narratives around craft that often dwell on decline and loss, the Snugglewalas bring a refreshing shift - celebrating possibility, positivity and the next generation of craft. This showcase looks ahead, not behind: to a future where artisans and young design talent collaborate to reimagine traditions for tomorrow.",
