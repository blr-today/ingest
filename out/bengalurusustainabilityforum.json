    "description": "Rivers & People: A Disconnect in Times of Scarcity\nCreating a Space to Think, Ideate and Protect Rivers\nBengaluru, India\u2019s economic engine, is a water-starved city. The Cauvery river, its lifeline, is\u00a0drying up and severely polluted, while the Western Ghats forests, where its waters originate, are rapidly degrading. Yet, the government continues to push for unsound projects like the\u00a0Mekedatu Dam and Yettinahole Drinking Water project, further damaging the rivers and forests\u00a0that sustain us. Amid this, the city remains disconnected from its rivers, yet perpetually thirsty. \nThis session will begin with a discussion followed by songs about rivers sung by children and an English adaptation of Komal\u00a0Swaminathan\u2019s 1980 satirical Tamil play\u00a0Thaneer Thaneer. Set in a drought-ridden village in Tamil Nadu, the play follows a stranger who helps the villagers harness water against political and natural challenges, showing the power of a community deeply connected to its water sources. \nIt promises to be a valuable experience for anyone who cares about the environment, our rivers, and the future we are shaping for generations to come. \nRSVP Here \nPaani.Earth, a citizen-led think tank, is dedicated to river conservation. The team will share\u00a0their efforts to protect the rivers that sustain us. Through this session, they aim to foster a deep\u00a0understanding and compassion for rivers \u2014 crucial for meaningful change. \nSpeakers and Performers \n\n\n\n\n\nNidhi Paliwal- Curator & Researcher, Paani.Earth\nNirmala Gowda \u2013 Curator & Researcher, Paani.Earth\nMadhuri Mandava \u2013 Curator & Researcher, Paani.Earth\nKhushbu K Birawat \u2013 Curator & Researcher, Paani.Earth\nGoodEarth Malhar Community Theatre Group",

    "description": "Enough has been written and described about Bengaluru being the city of lakes and tanks. However, many of these public spaces continue to be in disrepair despite the tremendous amount of work undertaken towards restoring lakes, highlighting the need for more sustained efforts in this direction. Numerous initiatives have focussed on protecting Bengaluru\u2019s lakes, but these initiatives are often confronted with a\u00a0lack of resources, limited understanding of management policies, and inadequate ecological considerations of\u00a0outcomes. \nAs part of their initiatives on climate change and sustainability, Azim Premji University is organising a one-day workshop on understanding the processes involved in lake restoration. We aim to provide a platform for communities to come together and learn about the importance of lake restoration, and understand how to engage in restoration efforts. \nEngage in meaningful discussion and dialogue around lake restoration processes, and learn from the experiences of communities that have succeeded in similar efforts. The workshop will include citizen groups, ecologists, researchers and practitioners experienced in the area of restoration of\u00a0lakes. \nThe workshop will highlight the role of citizens and communities, the collaboration of stakeholders including governments, resident associations, civil society groups, and donors, and will detail the various steps in lake restoration, through conversations with experts involved in this journey for decades. In addition, the workshop will underline the need for effective communication and dissemination to garner public\u00a0support. \nRegister Now",

    "description": "The Children need Nature conference is being offered to all by Prakriya Green Wisdom School and Bhoomi College with Karma Bhoomi Trust as the organiser. \nAbout the Conference: Many thought leaders and educationists would agree that all of us, children as well as adults will benefit from connecting to Nature, living a lifestyle that values Nature more. In addition, today there is increasing scientific research as well, that makes it clear that children need Nature for multiple reasons, not only for their physical and mental health, but also to improve their cognitive and creative abilities as well as their socio-emotional and personal growth. It is also becoming increasingly clear that it is essential to foster future generations who have a greater connect with Nature and a greater willingness to engage in climate action and practices for sustainability. What the world needs more than ever before are custodians and stewards of nature! It has become an imperative in times of acute climate crisis and nature disconnect. \nThe purpose of this conference is to create a space for parents, educators and school administrators to share research findings and nature education practices and join a movement to include Nature education sessions in schools to care for the future of our children and the future of our planet. The organisers welcome you to be part of the conference! \nREGISTER NOW",
