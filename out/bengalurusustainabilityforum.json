      "description": "Join for a talk by BlueMAP-India to learn about India's marine life, habitats, and threats with a marine life-themed quiz and other activities.\r\n\r\nBlueMAP-India is WCS-India's newly launched, interactive website that hosts information on India’s marine life, habitats, ecosystem services, threats, Marine Protected Areas, and a guide to the main conservation laws and policies. This resource seeks to contribute towards UN SDGs 14 (life below water) and 4 (education) while filling in a large gap in marine conservation – the lack of a centralised information repository on India’s marine biodiversity and policies for the public.\r\n\r\nTo join online, <a href=\"https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_dYigRo12S26V7-f74S71jA#/registration\">click here.</a>",
