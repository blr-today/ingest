This discussion will cover Lakshmi\u2019s experience of compiling and editing the life and values of Didi Contractor, in her latest book A CALL TO RETURN: A JOURNEY WITH DIDI CONTRACTOR. \nAbout the speakers:  \nLakshmi Swaminathan is an architect from Chennai. After graduation, she worked in a conventional architecture office, taught in design schools, and pursued her passion for khadi textiles through weaving and block printing. In 2017, seeking inspiration for her own practice, she came to Kangra valley to spend a day with Didi in 2017.

    "description": "Carbon has been an invisible protagonist on the celluloid screen for a while now. Our lives are saturated with carbon, and the screen reflects its presence everywhere. Though unseen, carbon\u2019s influence permeates our lives and finds reflection in countless stories on the big screen. This festival invites you on a journey from the barren grounds of an e-waste dump yard to the magical forests of the Western Ghats. We will showcase a distinctive collection of cinematic narratives centred on the theme of carbon and bring to life stories that span generations, reflecting both the past and the ever-evolving present. These stories of ambition, resilience, and perseverance will offer a deeper understanding of carbon and films, shedding light on the transformative power of carbon.\nThe festival strives to create an immersive environment where visitors can deeply interact with these ideas through various films and discussions. We are offering a wide array of films spanning different languages, including German, English, French, and Hindi, and genres, from documentary features and narrative features to docufictions and animated shorts. Filmmakers and scholars have been encouraged to create a colourful, interactive space that encourages people of all ages to consider carbon\u2019s critical role in our lives and the global ecosystem. \u2013 Science Gallery Bengaluru",

    "description": "A book discussion between Gigi Ganguly, Vinayak Varma and Radhika Timbadia. They will be discussing Gigi\u2019s latest book BIOPECULIAR, a collection of speculative short stories that speak about her deep love for the natural world.  \nAbout the book: \nThese speculative short stories talk about the wonders of the natural world, and also shed light on the grave concern about the crises that envelop it today. At once fantastical and familiar, playful and disturbing, these stories root around in the world we think we know, dredging up truths that often evade our eyes. \nAbout the speakers: \nGigi Ganguly is a writer of speculative fiction, with a Masters in Creative Writing from the University of Limerick in Ireland. \n Radhika Timbadia is the proprietrix of Champaca. She has previously worked in the field of community-based wildlife conservation in Spiti and Ladakh. \nVinayak Varma is the editor of the SFF anthology STRANGE WORLDS! STRANGE TIMES!, the author-illustrator of several children\u2019s books, and was the founding editor and art director of the science magazine Brainwave. He is a recipient of The Hindu Young World-Goodbooks Award (for Angry Akku, Pratham Books) and the Publishing Next Digital Book of the Year Award (for Jadav and the Tree-Place, Pratham Books), is a 2023 BSFA Award finalist (for artwork published in Interzone), and has been shortlisted for the 2016 Commonwealth Short Story Prize (for his story \u201cInstant Karma\u201d)",
