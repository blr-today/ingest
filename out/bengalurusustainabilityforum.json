However, the process of urbanisation intertwines with social and economic factors, creating complex interactions that demand our attention. Urban ecology addresses these challenges by studying ecology in, of, and for the city. Through a series of engaging activities focussed on India, this quarter\u2019s exhibition is curated to introduce a broader audience to this fascinating area of research. \nThe curated collection of books, publications and research articles delves into the complex interactions between cities, nature, and the social factors that influence them. \nThe exhibition is free and open to all; walk in and enjoy the curation.\u00a0Don\u2019t miss the dedicated corner showcasing publications from our Small Grants Programme Projects!\u00a0",
