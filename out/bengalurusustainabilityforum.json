In addition, today there is increasing scientific research as well, that makes it clear that children need Nature for multiple reasons, not only for their physical and mental health, but also to improve their cognitive and creative abilities as well as their socio-emotional and personal growth. It is also becoming increasingly clear that it is essential to foster future generations who have a greater connect with Nature and a greater willingness to engage in climate action and practices for sustainability. What the world needs more than ever before are custodians and stewards of nature! It has become an imperative in times of acute climate crisis and nature disconnect. \nThe purpose of this conference is to create a space for parents, educators and school administrators to share research findings and nature education practices and join a movement to include Nature education sessions in schools to care for the future of our children and the future of our planet. The organisers welcome you to be part of the conference! \nREGISTER NOW",
