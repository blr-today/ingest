    "description": "Bengaluru\u2019s trees are a collection of both native and exotic species which lend the city its botanical diversity. The trees are part of a network of local and global transactions of human minds that work to nurture the cosmopolitan nature of this global city. These trees are part of our social, cultural, and emotional landscape. In this lecture, art historian Suresh Jayaram will unpack the city\u2019s entanglement with the aesthetic curation of trees and their role in giving the city an identity. Join us for an exploration of the trees around us! \nRegister Now",

    "description": "Every day we hear something unusual. A fire here, a flood there, a storm surge, a cloudburst. These events affect all of us, our well-being, our health, our family, our work. Their frequency and intensity are increasing. Fortunately, however, we no longer lack explanations for these events. We know fossil fuels and the destruction of Nature by us humans are the primary reasons for the alarming acceleration in global warming. \nAwareness is the first step towards change, and Rajan Mehta\u2019s\u00a0Backstage Climate\u00a0is an attempt to make you aware of global warming and climate change in a simple and interesting manner. It demystifies this grim reality\u2014the science, the politics and the economics behind climate change. It also gives you a glimpse of the policies, technology and solutions that can help save the planet and ensure our survival. \nGoing slightly beyond mere awareness, the attempt is to help the reader connect the dots and develop a perspective on the reasons, impact and solutions that can help us avoid a climate crisis. \nRajan Mehta will be in conversation with Prem Panicker. The discussion will be followed by a\u00a0Q&A session with the audience. \nRSVP Here",

    "description": "The Children need Nature conference is being offered to all by Prakriya Green Wisdom School and Bhoomi College with Karma Bhoomi Trust as the organiser. \nAbout the Conference: Many thought leaders and educationists would agree that all of us, children as well as adults will benefit from connecting to Nature, living a lifestyle that values Nature more. In addition, today there is increasing scientific research as well, that makes it clear that children need Nature for multiple reasons, not only for their physical and mental health, but also to improve their cognitive and creative abilities as well as their socio-emotional and personal growth. It is also becoming increasingly clear that it is essential to foster future generations who have a greater connect with Nature and a greater willingness to engage in climate action and practices for sustainability. What the world needs more than ever before are custodians and stewards of nature! It has become an imperative in times of acute climate crisis and nature disconnect. \nThe purpose of this conference is to create a space for parents, educators and school administrators to share research findings and nature education practices and join a movement to include Nature education sessions in schools to care for the future of our children and the future of our planet. The organisers welcome you to be part of the conference! \nREGISTER NOW",
