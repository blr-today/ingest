      "description": "In <em>The Great Nicobar Betrayal</em>, Pankaj Sekhsaria, one of the best known chroniclers of contemporary issues in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, has compiled a set of articles written by various experts across publications that examine the proposed project from every angle—environmental, geological, impact on local communities, law, due process, and ecology.\r\n\r\nThese pieces together shed light on the magnitude of the disaster that will be unleashed on this pristine place if the project comes through. The book is a warning and a catalogue of the manmade catastrophe that lurks on the horizon, one that will destroy more than the tsunami of December 2004 ever did.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Pankaj Sekhsaria is in conversation with Prof. Lawrence Surendra and Vaishna Roy. A Q&amp;A with the audience will follow.\r\n<div class=\"event-speaker-bio\">\r\n\r\nPankaj Sekhsaria is the author/editor of six books on the Andaman &amp; Nicobar islands including <em>Islands in Flux – the Andaman and Nicobar Story</em> (Harper Litmus 2023), which is a collection of 20 years of his journalism about the islands and most recently <em>The Great Nicobar Betrayal </em>(Frontline, 2024).\r\n\r\n</div>",
