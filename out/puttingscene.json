She has explored everything from addiction and reward circuits to the neuroscience of brain tumors, and while she earned her Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, what excites her most is stepping outside the lab to share just how fascinating our brains really are. Passionate about making science accessible, Sumyuktha brings the marvels of neuroscience to non-specialist communities and now, to you \u2014 over a pint.\n\nHer talk, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Oops: Why Neuroscience Says Your Memory Can\u2019t Be Trusted, dives into the quirks of memory and the science of neuroplasticity. We like to think of memory as a reliable archive, but the truth is it\u2019s constantly being rewritten, distorted, and reinvented by our brains. Why does this happen? What does it say about how our brains work? And how does this \u201cunreliability\u201d help us more than it harms us?\n\nCome, find out, and bring your questions \u2014 from everyday forgetfulness to the bigger mysteries of how memory shapes identity.\n\nAll of this, over Geist beer on tap at Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nA 60-minute lecture on memory, neuroplasticity, and why our brains misremember\n15-20 minutes of interactive Q&A\nOne Geist beer on tap or a mocktail included with your ticket\nA lively mixer to share your insights, laugh over your \u201coops\u201d moments, and walk away seeing your memory in a whole new way\n\nAbout the Lecturer\n\nDr. Sumyuktha Anand is a neuroscientist and science communicator who has researched topics ranging from addiction and reward circuits to brain tumors. With a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, she is passionate about making brain science fun and accessible beyond academic circles \u2014 through teaching, writing, and now, with Pint of View.\n\nAbout Pint of View\n\nInspired by the successful Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., Pint of View brings this format to India for the first time. It\u2019s where big ideas meet bar tables, and where you enjoy a drink in hand while walking out with a new way of seeing the world.\n\nBook now & develop your own pint of view! \ud83c\udf7b",

    "description": "Join us for a screening of Pottery House by Mansi Bhatt, an experimental film that explores memory, heritage, and architecture through the remains of a demolished home on the Khodiyar Pottery Estate. In this layered journey, Mansi blurs, overlays, and sutures objects and images, reanimating her family\u2019s former house until its curves and textures become tangible once more. The film asks: what happens when a place transforms into a state of irrecognition\u2014or disappears altogether along with the boundaries that once defined it?\n\nFollowing the screening, join architect and theorist Dr. Kaiwan Mehta for a discussion on the idea of Home, between memory and culture. Together, they will reflect on how architecture shapes human experience and the importance of recognising built environments as vessels of history and imagination.\n\nThis programme is presented in celebration of World Architecture Day, 6 October.",
