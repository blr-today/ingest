    "description": "Sabari\u2019s encounter with Rama is an important episode in the Ramayana. But who was Sabari, a forest-dweller who became Rama\u2019s ardent devotee?\n\nIn On the Banks of the Pampa, award-winning writer Volga narrates the tale of Sabari, born of aranyavasis, once forced into slavery by a power-seeking state, which she breaks free from. It traces the journey of her spiritual awakening and birth into a voice of dissent for the oppressed and dispossessed. Sabari\u2019s is a narrative entwined with the forest along the Pampa river \u2013 one she comes to dwell in and is at one with.\n\nPoignant and piercing, this concluding volume in Volga\u2019s trilogy of feminist retellings of the Indian epics drives us to reconsider the meaning of dharma, and rejects ideologies that legitimize conquest and the exploitation of nature. Powerfully translated into English by Purnima Tammireddy, this is a story of resistance \u2013 a story for the times we live in, drawn from the classic tale we know so well.\n\nAbout the speakers: \n\nVolga is a writer, critic, translator and poet, who has been a forerunner in introducing a feminist perspective into the literary-political discourse of the Telugu-speaking states. She is best known for her feminist retellings of Indian epics, The Liberation of Sita and Yashodhara, and her latest novel concludes this trilogy. Other notable works include her earlier novels Sahaja and Sveccha, short story collections, feminist philosophy and literary criticism, and translations of Telugu works. She is the recipient of numerous awards including the Sahitya Akademi Award, and her work opened the floodgates for a host of women writers to articulate the doubts and confusions they experienced as women. \n\nPurnima Tammireddy is a writer, translator, and publisher, who currently lives in Bengaluru. She is the translator of On the Banks of the Pampa, and has also translated works by Manto and Amrita Pritam into Telugu. She is also the author of the short-story collection Emotional Pregnancy. She is the founder of Elami Publications, an independent Telugu publishing house, and co-founder of pustakam.net, a website for book reviews.\n\nModerating today's session is Chandan Gowda is a Professor of Sociology and the Dean of Vidyashilp University\u2019s School of Liberal Arts.
