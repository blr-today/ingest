    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where classroom-styled lectures meet craft cocktails in pubs and bars.\r\n\r\nIn our fourth lecture, we\u2019re bringing you Kaustubh Khare, a semiotician, educator, and believer that everyone can draw. This one\u2019s special: part lecture, part workshop on visual thinking. Kaustubh will show how doodling and drawing can transform into tools for clarity, creativity, and sharper articulation, and even help ideas stick in memory for longer. All of this, over Geist beer on tap at Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar.\r\n\r\nWhat to Expect:\r\n\r\n\u2022 A 60-minute lecture-workshop on visual thinking and its everyday applications\r\n\u2022 15\u201320 minutes of interactive Q&A\r\n\u2022 One Geist beer on tap included with your ticket\r\n\u2022 A lively mixer to share what you drew, see how others mapped their insights, and take home a new perspective\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t an art class or a drawing workshop. Through Kaustubh\u2019s lived experience, we\u2019ll explore the science of visual thinking and its real-world uses: from mind maps and graphs to teaching tools and even investor pitch decks. All in the chill vibe of a pub lecture, over a drink and some grub.\r\n\r\nEvent Details:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, 21st September | 4 PM \u2013 6 PM\r\n\ud83d\udccd Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar\r\n\ud83c\udfab Limited to 60 attendees only\r\n\r\nAbout the Lecturer\r\n\r\nKaustubh Khare believes that everyone can draw and that drawing is less about talent and more about how we think. His lecture-workshops transform doodling into a powerful tool for clarity, creativity, and collaboration. He has worked with governments, universities, startups, and nonprofits on diverse projects, including designing visual pedagogical tools now used by over half a million government school teachers in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. A graduate of IIT Kharagpur, Ashoka University, and the University of Tartu, he is currently exploring how India's heritage can be brought alive through visual storytelling.\r\n\r\nAbout Pint of View\r\n\r\nInspired by the successful Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., Pint of View brings this format to India for the first time. It\u2019s where big ideas meet bar tables, and where you enjoy a drink in hand, walking out with a new way of seeing the world.\r\n\r\nBook now & develop your own pint of view! \ud83c\udf7b",

    "description": "Join us for an engaging evening as Arunima Tenzin Tara and Sheila Kumar delve into the intricate layers of The Ex-Daughters of Tolstoy House. The discussion will explore the novel's exploration of patriarchy and its impact on what appears to be a perfect Indian family. Through their conversation, they will shed light on the larger implications of misogyny in Indian society and how literature can serve as a mirror to these societal issues.\n\nThis event promises to be an insightful exploration of themes that resonate deeply in contemporary society. Whether you're a fan of gothic-noir fiction or interested in discussions about societal structures and their representations in literature, this evening offers a platform for thoughtful dialogue and reflection.",
