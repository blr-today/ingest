    "description": "In this 90-minute deep dive into arm balances, we\u2019ll move beyond the surface and into the strength, structure, and spirit of the poses that make us feel like we're flying.\n\nWe\u2019ll begin by warming up the body with targeted strength and mobility drills to activate the core, wrists, and shoulders. This lays the foundation for safe and sustainable arm balancing.\nFrom there, we\u2019ll explore essential alignment principles that demystify key transitions and make these seemingly impossible shapes, more accessible.\nThrough clear breakdowns and playful experimentation, you\u2019ll learn how to \u201ctake off\u201d with confidence\u2014whether you\u2019re working on Crow, Side Crow, Hustler\u2019s or Peacock pose.\nWe\u2019ll also cover how to fall safely, so fear doesn\u2019t hold you back, and give space for mindful repetition, skill refinement, and personal breakthroughs.\nExpect a blend of technique, mindset coaching, and drills, all aimed at helping you tap into your inner strength and elevate your practice.\n\nWhether you're just starting to hover or need refining in arm balances; this is a safe space for you to practice and learn.",

She has explored everything from addiction and reward circuits to the neuroscience of brain tumors, and while she earned her Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, what excites her most is stepping outside the lab to share just how fascinating our brains really are. Passionate about making science accessible, Sumyuktha brings the marvels of neuroscience to non-specialist communities and now, to you \u2014 over a pint.\n\nHer talk, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Oops: Why Neuroscience Says Your Memory Can\u2019t Be Trusted, dives into the quirks of memory and the science of neuroplasticity. We like to think of memory as a reliable archive, but the truth is it\u2019s constantly being rewritten, distorted, and reinvented by our brains. Why does this happen? What does it say about how our brains work? And how does this \u201cunreliability\u201d help us more than it harms us?\n\nCome, find out, and bring your questions \u2014 from everyday forgetfulness to the bigger mysteries of how memory shapes identity.\n\nAll of this, over Geist beer on tap at Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nA 60-minute lecture on memory, neuroplasticity, and why our brains misremember\n15-20 minutes of interactive Q&A\nOne Geist beer on tap or a mocktail included with your ticket\nA lively mixer to share your insights, laugh over your \u201coops\u201d moments, and walk away seeing your memory in a whole new way\n\nAbout the Lecturer\n\nDr. Sumyuktha Anand is a neuroscientist and science communicator who has researched topics ranging from addiction and reward circuits to brain tumors. With a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, she is passionate about making brain science fun and accessible beyond academic circles \u2014 through teaching, writing, and now, with Pint of View.\n\nAbout Pint of View\n\nInspired by the successful Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., Pint of View brings this format to India for the first time. It\u2019s where big ideas meet bar tables, and where you enjoy a drink in hand while walking out with a new way of seeing the world.\n\nBook now & develop your own pint of view! \ud83c\udf7b",

In this layered journey, Mansi blurs, overlays, and sutures objects and images, reanimating her family\u2019s former house until its curves and textures become tangible once more. The film asks: what happens when a place transforms into a state of irrecognition\u2014or disappears altogether along with the boundaries that once defined it?\n\nFollowing the screening, join architect and theorist Dr. Kaiwan Mehta for a discussion on the idea of Home, between memory and culture. Together, they will reflect on how architecture shapes human experience and the importance of recognising built environments as vessels of history and imagination.\n\nThis programme is presented in celebration of World Architecture Day, 6 October.",

    "description": "The thing about running that no one talks about\n\nTwo runners start the same training plan. Same distance, same pace, same dedication. Six months later, one feels stronger than ever. The other constantly asks chatGPT about \"knee pain remedies\" at 2 AM.\n\nWhat's the difference? It's not about talent. And while effort and consistency are important, they're just one part of the whole story.\nThe gap between these two types of runners isn't mysterious once you know what to look for. It's about inside-out performance: understanding what's happening beneath the surface and preparing with the right data.\n\nOn 4th October, learn the science behind fueling, race-day prep & recovery.\n\nAshwin Adiga (Director, NEB | CEO, MySamay & Enerjiva) will walk through a case study on Amar Singh Devanda's path to setting 12 hour & 24 hour National Records \n\nDr Gurmeet Soni Bhalla (Chief Medical Officer, Resolute | Ultra Runner | Completed Marathons across 7 continents & The North Pole!) will be breaking down the science behind fueling, race-day prep & recovery, and using data to unlock your best performance\n\nAnuj Srivastava (Cofounder, Troop HQ | Strength & Mobility coach) will guide you through a hands-on session on runner-specific workouts for long-term overall health\n\nWhether you're running your first 5K or your fiftieth marathon, come learn what makes the difference between runners who thrive and runners who survive.\n\nIncludes: Coffee, Q&As, and 1-on-1s with our experts.",

This event marks the final day of the nine-day festival, a time of both joyous celebration and poignant farewell to Goddess Durga. The day's proceedings will commence early in the morning, filled with traditional rituals and cultural significance. A central part of the celebration is the 'Sindoor Khela,' a vibrant ritual where married women smear vermilion on each other, wishing for a long and happy married life. This is followed by the immersion of the Durga idol, symbolizing her return to her celestial abode. This community gathering at the Lotus Convention Centre offers a chance to experience the rich cultural heritage of Bengal. Attendees can partake in the spiritual ambiance, witness the heartfelt rituals, and share sweets and greetings, embodying the spirit of unity and togetherness. The event is a sensory delight, filled with the sounds of dhak (traditional drums), devotional songs, and the sight of beautifully adorned idols. It's an open invitation for everyone to immerse themselves in the festive spirit, reflecting on the victory of good over evil and looking forward to the Goddess's return next year. This is more than just a religious ceremony; it is a cultural spectacle and a testament to the community's spirit.",

    "description": "Can dance translate the restlessness of a conscience, the weight of compassion? With Gandhi, choreographer C P Satyajit reimagines the Mahatma\u2019s life and philosophy through the timeless language of Bharatanatyam. This is not a chronological retelling, but a meditation on his ideals: his restless pursuit of truth, his unwavering sense of justice, his profound connection with people. Through delicate abhinaya and layered rhythmic improvisations, the production traces Gandhi\u2019s journey as both a leader and a seeker. Informed by the research of Dr. V R Devika, whose PhD explored Gandhi\u2019s communication strategies, the work captures how his ideals might continue to move us, literally and metaphorically, today. In this unique performance, every gesture is a reminder that truth and compassion remain unfinished tasks.",

    "description": "The Raman Research Institute hosts the 51st Gandhi Memorial Lecture, titled 'Research with the People: Experiments of health care inspired by Mahatma Gandhi,' delivered by the esteemed Dr. Abhay Bang. Dr. Bang, a physician and public health expert, is the founder of the Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health (SEARCH) in the Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra. Growing up in the Sevagram ashram of Mahatma Gandhi, his work is deeply inspired by Gandhian principles. The lecture will delve into his pioneering experiments in community health, particularly the home-based newborn and child care model. This innovative approach, developed and tested in Gadchiroli, successfully reduced infant mortality rates by over 70% and has since been adopted by the Government of India as a national program (ASHA) and scaled up in multiple countries. Dr. Bang will also share insights from his work leading community-based campaigns against alcohol and tobacco consumption. Recognized globally for his contributions, he is a recipient of the Padma Shri, a WHO Public Health Champion, and was honored by Time magazine as a Global Health Hero. The event offers a unique opportunity to learn from a visionary whose work has transformed public health at both local and global levels.",
