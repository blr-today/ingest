Bringing these narratives to life are some of the best storytellers on women's cricket: Karunya Keshav (Editor, Sportswriter & Advocate for Women in Sport), Ananya Upendran (Writer & Former Cricketer), and Aayush Puthran (Author & Journalist).\n\nHosted in collaboration with Bookmark - a dating app for readers. Created by the founders of Cubbon Reads, Bookmark is an app where one swipes books, not looks. Through a virtual bookshelf and prompts, people can find book buddies across the world.\n\nThis is a conversation that\u2019s never been attempted on a stage globally, so far.

This engaging evening will revisit the 2017 World Cup at Lords\u2014an inflection point for women\u2019s sport in India\u2014and examine how that moment sparked a shift in perceptions and paved the way for the Women\u2019s Premier League. Attendees will gain a richer understanding of how these early, often overlooked narratives laid the groundwork for today\u2019s growth in women\u2019s cricket.

Back in \u201996, the song called out imitation and reminded us to never follow the herd. We\u2019re flipping that spirit into a celebration of what hip\u2011hop truly does: the cipher, the record shop, the basement session, the block party\u2026 For our first edition, we\u2019re going to dive into the frequencies that defined a generation. From hip\u2011hop\u2019s golden age to neo\u2011soul\u2019s lush warmth and R&B\u2019s undeniable sway, the night is built on the grooves that shaped the culture and still echo today. What They Do is our ode to hip\u2011hop in its broadest sense, not just through sound, but also the feeling. This is where stories find space again and Edition 1 is just the beginning.
