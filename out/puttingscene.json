    "description": "Step back in time at The Analog Club, an event series by the Studio by Copper + Cloves.\n\nImagine walking into a busy cafe and seeing not a single phone, no-one taking selfies and no one around you scrolling.\n\nDisconnect from devices for 3 hours of unplugged experience\u2014we'll have books, board games, music, crochet, and of course, food! But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!\n\nMeet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).\n\nWe will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.\n\nEmbrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age!\n\n\nTickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter.",
