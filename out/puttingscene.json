    "description": "Explore the fascinating intersection of ancient stories and modern sensibilities in 'Glitch in the Myth.' This innovative event challenges traditional narratives by introducing unexpected twists, contemporary perspectives, and 'glitches' that force us to re-examine the myths we thought we knew. Held at the Bangalore International Centre, the performance or discussion series delves into how timeless tales from folklore and mythology can be deconstructed and reinterpreted to reflect our current social and cultural realities. The event might feature storytellers, artists, or scholars who disrupt conventional plotlines, question established morals, and give voice to marginalized characters. Imagine a classic epic with a technological bug, a mythological hero facing a modern-day ethical dilemma, or a goddess reclaiming her narrative from a patriarchal lens. 'Glitch in the Myth' is a playground for creative and critical thought, encouraging audiences to think about the power of stories and how they shape our understanding of the world. It's an intellectually stimulating and entertaining experience that breathes new life into old tales, making them more relevant and resonant for a 21st-century audience. This event is perfect for anyone interested in mythology, storytelling, cultural studies, and the art of creative subversion.",
