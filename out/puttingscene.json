But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!\n\nMeet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).\n\nWe will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.\n\nEmbrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age!\n\n\nTickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter.",

    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where classroom-styled lectures meet craft cocktails in pubs and bars.\n\nIn our sixth lecture, we\u2019re bringing you Dr. Sumyuktha Anand, a neuroscientist and science communicator who calls herself a neuroscience nerd. She has explored everything from addiction and reward circuits to the neuroscience of brain tumors, and while she earned her Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, what excites her most is stepping outside the lab to share just how fascinating our brains really are. Passionate about making science accessible, Sumyuktha brings the marvels of neuroscience to non-specialist communities and now, to you \u2014 over a pint.\n\nHer talk, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Oops: Why Neuroscience Says Your Memory Can\u2019t Be Trusted, dives into the quirks of memory and the science of neuroplasticity. We like to think of memory as a reliable archive, but the truth is it\u2019s constantly being rewritten, distorted, and reinvented by our brains. Why does this happen? What does it say about how our brains work? And how does this \u201cunreliability\u201d help us more than it harms us?\n\nCome, find out, and bring your questions \u2014 from everyday forgetfulness to the bigger mysteries of how memory shapes identity.\n\nAll of this, over Geist beer on tap at Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nA 60-minute lecture on memory, neuroplasticity, and why our brains misremember\n15-20 minutes of interactive Q&A\nOne Geist beer on tap or a mocktail included with your ticket\nA lively mixer to share your insights, laugh over your \u201coops\u201d moments, and walk away seeing your memory in a whole new way\n\nAbout the Lecturer\n\nDr. Sumyuktha Anand is a neuroscientist and science communicator who has researched topics ranging from addiction and reward circuits to brain tumors. With a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, she is passionate about making brain science fun and accessible beyond academic circles \u2014 through teaching, writing, and now, with Pint of View.\n\nAbout Pint of View\n\nInspired by the successful Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., Pint of View brings this format to India for the first time. It\u2019s where big ideas meet bar tables, and where you enjoy a drink in hand while walking out with a new way of seeing the world.\n\nBook now & develop your own pint of view! \ud83c\udf7b",

    "description": "Join us for a screening of Pottery House by Mansi Bhatt, an experimental film that explores memory, heritage, and architecture through the remains of a demolished home on the Khodiyar Pottery Estate. In this layered journey, Mansi blurs, overlays, and sutures objects and images, reanimating her family\u2019s former house until its curves and textures become tangible once more. The film asks: what happens when a place transforms into a state of irrecognition\u2014or disappears altogether along with the boundaries that once defined it?\n\nFollowing the screening, join architect and theorist Dr. Kaiwan Mehta for a discussion on the idea of Home, between memory and culture. Together, they will reflect on how architecture shapes human experience and the importance of recognising built environments as vessels of history and imagination.\n\nThis programme is presented in celebration of World Architecture Day, 6 October.",

The walk serves as a wonderful opportunity for both novice and experienced birdwatchers to explore the local avifauna. Participants are requested to gather at the Saul Kere [Savala Kere] East Entrance at 7:00 am; the walk typically concludes by 9:30 am. The meeting point is accessible via the RMZ Ecoworld/Adarsh Palm Retreat road, and a precise Google Maps link is provided for easy navigation. For those using public transport, the nearest bus stop is the Intel stop on the Ring Road, which is approximately a 2-kilometer or a 20-minute walk to the lake. Several bus routes, including those from Banashankari towards Marathahalli, service this stop. To ensure a comfortable and productive experience, attendees are advised to wear dull-coloured clothing, a hat or cap, and comfortable walking shoes. Depending on the weather forecast, rain gear may be necessary. It is recommended to bring a notebook and pen/pencil for taking notes, and plenty of water to stay hydrated. Optional but helpful items include bird books or mobile apps for identification, binoculars for better viewing, and a camera to capture the moments. You may also want to bring your own snacks. After the walk, there is a suggestion to visit The Rasaganga, a nearby restaurant with parking, for a post-outing meal and discussion.",

    "description": "The Colonial Crawl is a taste of history hidden right under your noses. In this walk, we will explore how the British sahibs, memsahibs, and royalty left their mark on the garden city. The English influence on the sprawling Cubbon park, the origins of the Cantonment area, and the surrounding architecture are testimony to a lot of events in history. For example, the American War of Independence, the Battle of Waterloo, and the French Revolution had a connection to this region. We will spill more of this tea when you walk with us. Whether you are visiting or you are a local, we promise you will see the city in a different light once you learn about the colonial influence on its churches, clubs, parks, and its people. Cubbon mornings are a sight to sore eyes, and the perfect time to discover the Colonial Hangover in one of the older parts of the city.",
