But this isn't about structured activities or organised fun, just genuine connection and relaxation. The event will be fluid- you can dip into activities if you want, or you can just chat to new people or graze at our high tea counter!\n\nMeet new friends, sketch, or read a book in quiet solitude (without being surrounded by people lost in their phones).\n\nWe will not be doing social media on our phones at the event, we will only take photos with a camera.\n\nEmbrace the analog experience, slow down, and reconnect in this crazy digital age!\n\n\nTickets are for entry, all games and art supplies, and unlimited high tea from our renowned deli counter.",

An origami flasher is a folding pattern, often from a square sheet of paper, that can transform between a compressed state and an expanded, often 3D, form.\nIn this beginner-friendly workshop, we\u2019ll explore basic folding techniques and learn how to create flashers. These models are known for their dynamic, self-folding, or rotating properties, which allow them to \"flash\" or change shape with a simple action.\u00a0The design concept has been applied in the engineering field for deployable structures like solar arrays, as the paper can be compacted for transport and then expanded in space. \nAll materials will be provided. Feel free to bring your own patterned/ colored papers/ used gift wrapping papers / paper bags for the workshop\n\nGeneral Rules:\n-Ages 14 and above.\n-Contact 9845620061 for more details.",
