    "description": "Some books stay with you long after you\u2019ve turned the last page. Heart Lamp, the International Booker Prize\u2013winning anthology by Banu Mushtaq, is one of those rare works. It makes you think and it makes you feel\u2014drawing you into the lived experiences of Indian Muslim women, while also inviting you to reflect on your own world.\nThis October, we\u2019re bringing Heart Lamp off the page and into our lives with an interactive workshop on the idea of freedom at our Indiranagar store. \nBut this isn\u2019t your usual book discussion. Instead, we\u2019ll explore three of the anthology\u2019s most powerful stories through music, art, and storytelling. It\u2019s a chance to step away from screens, share perspectives, and spend a Sunday morning in meaningful conversation with fellow readers. No prior prep is needed\u2014just pick up your copy of Heart Lamp at Champaca before the workshop.",

    "description": "In this 90-minute deep dive into arm balances, we\u2019ll move beyond the surface and into the strength, structure, and spirit of the poses that make us feel like we're flying.\n\nWe\u2019ll begin by warming up the body with targeted strength and mobility drills to activate the core, wrists, and shoulders. This lays the foundation for safe and sustainable arm balancing.\nFrom there, we\u2019ll explore essential alignment principles that demystify key transitions and make these seemingly impossible shapes, more accessible.\nThrough clear breakdowns and playful experimentation, you\u2019ll learn how to \u201ctake off\u201d with confidence\u2014whether you\u2019re working on Crow, Side Crow, Hustler\u2019s or Peacock pose.\nWe\u2019ll also cover how to fall safely, so fear doesn\u2019t hold you back, and give space for mindful repetition, skill refinement, and personal breakthroughs.\nExpect a blend of technique, mindset coaching, and drills, all aimed at helping you tap into your inner strength and elevate your practice.\n\nWhether you're just starting to hover or need refining in arm balances; this is a safe space for you to practice and learn.",

    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where classroom-styled lectures meet craft cocktails in pubs and bars.\n\nIn our sixth lecture, we\u2019re bringing you Dr. Sumyuktha Anand, a neuroscientist and science communicator who calls herself a neuroscience nerd. She has explored everything from addiction and reward circuits to the neuroscience of brain tumors, and while she earned her Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, what excites her most is stepping outside the lab to share just how fascinating our brains really are. Passionate about making science accessible, Sumyuktha brings the marvels of neuroscience to non-specialist communities and now, to you \u2014 over a pint.\n\nHer talk, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Oops: Why Neuroscience Says Your Memory Can\u2019t Be Trusted, dives into the quirks of memory and the science of neuroplasticity. We like to think of memory as a reliable archive, but the truth is it\u2019s constantly being rewritten, distorted, and reinvented by our brains. Why does this happen? What does it say about how our brains work? And how does this \u201cunreliability\u201d help us more than it harms us?\n\nCome, find out, and bring your questions \u2014 from everyday forgetfulness to the bigger mysteries of how memory shapes identity.\n\nAll of this, over Geist beer on tap at Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nA 60-minute lecture on memory, neuroplasticity, and why our brains misremember\n15-20 minutes of interactive Q&A\nOne Geist beer on tap or a mocktail included with your ticket\nA lively mixer to share your insights, laugh over your \u201coops\u201d moments, and walk away seeing your memory in a whole new way\n\nAbout the Lecturer\n\nDr. Sumyuktha Anand is a neuroscientist and science communicator who has researched topics ranging from addiction and reward circuits to brain tumors. With a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology, she is passionate about making brain science fun and accessible beyond academic circles \u2014 through teaching, writing, and now, with Pint of View.\n\nAbout Pint of View\n\nInspired by the successful Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., Pint of View brings this format to India for the first time. It\u2019s where big ideas meet bar tables, and where you enjoy a drink in hand while walking out with a new way of seeing the world.\n\nBook now & develop your own pint of view! \ud83c\udf7b",

    "description": "How do centuries-old verses find new life in rhythm and movement? KABIR is a Bharatanatyam production that brings the timeless poetry of Sant Kabir into conversation with dance. What makes this work unique is the seamless weaving of Kabir\u2019s Hindi verses into the expressive framework of Bharatanatyam, guided by the musical brilliance of Vidwan O. S. Arun. His evocative vocals create a living bridge between word and movement, allowing the spiritual depth of Kabir\u2019s poetry to bloom on stage. Conceived and choreographed by Varsha Akhouri, alumna and former faculty of the Kalakshetra Foundation, the production embodies both tradition and innovation. With her students carrying forward the performance, the piece becomes not just a retelling of Kabir\u2019s verses but a passing on of artistic legacy. Kabir\u2019s words question dogma, transcend boundaries, and call us to simplicity, love, and self-realisation. In this production, poetry and dance converge to reveal their continued resonance with our fragmented world. A performance for the divine within and without. Credits: Music and Vocals: O S Arun, Concept and Choreography: Varsha Akhouri, Tabla: Martin, Mridangam: Shivaprasad, Sitar: Kishore, Flute: Hariprasad, Sound engineer: Rakesh, Jathi: Sheejith Krishna, Lights: Venkatesh Krishna. Dancers: Asika Sajeevan, Aarathi S Nair, Devika AC, Jisma K.K, Roopesh PP, Shobhit Shivhare, Sreelakshmi EB, Sreeshna KM, Sreerejini NS. Performer Varsha Akhouri, an accomplished Bharatanatyam exponent, is a dynamic artist whose journey in dance embodies a seamless blend of tradition and innovation. An alumna and former faculty member of the Kalakshetra Foundation, her artistry reflects the depth of her training and the authenticity of her craft. Being the founder and director of \u2018Srishti\u2019, Varsha Akhouri has dedicated herself to nurturing the next generation of dancers, fostering creativity while staying rooted in the classical ethos. Her performances are marked by profound storytelling, precise technique, and an innate ability to connect deeply with the audience. As a celebrated soloist, she has graced numerous esteemed platforms. Varsha\u2019s artistic repertoire is enriched by her passion for exploring spiritual and philosophical themes, as seen in her current project on the mystic poet \u2018Kabir\u2019, featuring the soul-stirring music of Vidwan Sri O. S. Arun.",
