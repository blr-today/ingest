    "description": "The Prophet and the Poet is an internationally acclaimed play developed by the Bangalore Little Theatre (BLT). Based on the exchange of letters and articles between Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore over 25 years, with the Indian freedom struggle as the backdrop, the play reveals how the two personalities differed significantly on many matters, including the form and content of the freedom movement. Despite their deep differences, they maintained genuine respect and love for each other. The play has been used in senior-level leadership development programs, focusing on creating a culture of maturity in internal and external transactions. The Bangalore Little Theatre has performed the play for the President of India and at locations associated with Gandhi and Tagore. In 2014, Prasar Bharati commissioned a telefilm on the play.",
