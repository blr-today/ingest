    "description": "At Klaa, we\u2019re always celebrating the roots but sometimes, we like to bend the rules.\r\nNot So Klassic is our playful new series where we reimagine Goan flavours through a different lens: layered, experimental, and just a little bit cheeky.\r\n\r\nThink familiar ingredients doing unfamiliar things, flavours that surprise you, and plates that tell a new kind of story. Each menu is a limited-edition tasting experience paired with thoughtfully chosen wines to match the mood.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t your typical Goan thali.\r\nIt\u2019s Not So Klassic and we hope you\u2019re as excited to taste it as we are to cook it.",

    "description": "In this hands-on workshop, you\u2019ll explore the intersection of digital fabrication and traditional craft. We\u2019ll begin by customizing and laser cutting a small weaving loom (approx. 100 \u00d7 70 mm), with the option to personalize it through custom engraving. \nOnce your loom is ready, you\u2019ll learn the fundamentals of weaving\u2014how to set up the warp, weave different patterns, and experiment with textures and colors. By the end, you\u2019ll take home your own custom laser cut loom along with your woven creation, and the skills to continue weaving on your own. You will get to take home looms of 4 different sizes (40x50mm, 60x90mm, 65x45mm, 35x40mm), including the one you customize.\nThis workshop is perfect for anyone curious about laser cutting, textile art, or simply looking to try something new and tactile. No prior experience with laser cutting or weaving is required!\n\n-Ages 14 and above.\n-Please bring your own Laptops (Mac/Windows/Linux is okay)\n-Contact 9845620061 for more details.",
