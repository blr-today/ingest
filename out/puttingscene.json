    "description": "Welcome to Pint of View \u2013 Bangalore's first-ever community where classroom-styled lectures meet craft cocktails in pubs and bars.\r\n\r\nIn our fourth lecture, we\u2019re bringing you Kaustubh Khare, a semiotician, educator, and believer that everyone can draw. This one\u2019s special: part lecture, part workshop on visual thinking. Kaustubh will show how doodling and drawing can transform into tools for clarity, creativity, and sharper articulation, and even help ideas stick in memory for longer. All of this, over Geist beer on tap at Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar.\r\n\r\nWhat to Expect:\r\n\r\n\u2022 A 60-minute lecture-workshop on visual thinking and its everyday applications\r\n\u2022 15\u201320 minutes of interactive Q&A\r\n\u2022 One Geist beer on tap included with your ticket\r\n\u2022 A lively mixer to share what you drew, see how others mapped their insights, and take home a new perspective\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t an art class or a drawing workshop. Through Kaustubh\u2019s lived experience, we\u2019ll explore the science of visual thinking and its real-world uses: from mind maps and graphs to teaching tools and even investor pitch decks. All in the chill vibe of a pub lecture, over a drink and some grub.\r\n\r\nEvent Details:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcc5 Sunday, 21st September | 4 PM \u2013 6 PM\r\n\ud83d\udccd Jamming Goat 3.0, Indiranagar\r\n\ud83c\udfab Limited to 60 attendees only\r\n\r\nAbout the Lecturer\r\n\r\nKaustubh Khare believes that everyone can draw and that drawing is less about talent and more about how we think. His lecture-workshops transform doodling into a powerful tool for clarity, creativity, and collaboration. He has worked with governments, universities, startups, and nonprofits on diverse projects, including designing visual pedagogical tools now used by over half a million government school teachers in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. A graduate of IIT Kharagpur, Ashoka University, and the University of Tartu, he is currently exploring how India's heritage can be brought alive through visual storytelling.\r\n\r\nAbout Pint of View\r\n\r\nInspired by the successful Lectures on Tap community in the U.S., Pint of View brings this format to India for the first time. It\u2019s where big ideas meet bar tables, and where you enjoy a drink in hand, walking out with a new way of seeing the world.\r\n\r\nBook now & develop your own pint of view! \ud83c\udf7b",

    "description": "Join us for an engaging evening as Arunima Tenzin Tara and Sheila Kumar delve into the intricate layers of The Ex-Daughters of Tolstoy House. The discussion will explore the novel's exploration of patriarchy and its impact on what appears to be a perfect Indian family. Through their conversation, they will shed light on the larger implications of misogyny in Indian society and how literature can serve as a mirror to these societal issues.\n\nThis event promises to be an insightful exploration of themes that resonate deeply in contemporary society. Whether you're a fan of gothic-noir fiction or interested in discussions about societal structures and their representations in literature, this evening offers a platform for thoughtful dialogue and reflection.",

This early morning tour, beginning at 7:30 AM, transports participants back to the Third Anglo-Mysore War, a defining moment in the city's history. The walk will trace the footsteps of the armies of Tipu Sultan and the British East India Company, led by Lord Cornwallis. As you traverse the area around the historic Bangalore Fort and MG Road, the guide will recount the strategic maneuvers, the siege of the fort, and the eventual capture of the city by the British forces. This narrative-driven experience brings history to life by connecting historical accounts to the physical locations where these events transpired. You will learn about the fortifications of the old city, the key figures involved in the conflict, and the long-term consequences of the battle, which paved the way for British dominance in the region. This tour is ideal for military history enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in understanding the forces that shaped modern Bengaluru.

    "description": "Women have a complicated relationship with money. And it starts early. Many families shield their daughters from anything related to \u2018finance\u2019, but this well-meaning protection ends up being a disservice. When these young women step into the real world, they lack the confidence to make financial decisions\u2014not because they\u2019re incapable, but because they were never given information on budgeting, savings, and investments. Later in life, many continue to rely on their partners for investment decisions. This dependency on others will only stop when they have the right information and toolkit to take back control. That\u2019s where we come in. After two 'In Her Interest' pilots, we've realised what women need is a safe, private space to talk money\u2014where no question is too small or too basic. In our 5th In Her Interest session on September 20th in Bangalore, we will focus on two topics: how to create and build passive income and how to save for your retirement. The session is at the Samagata Foundation, on St. Mark's Road, Bangalore. Sushmitha Shetty\u2014a homemaker and trader who makes 60 k as passive income\u2014and Dr. Sagneet Kaur, Financial Behaviour Scientist at PGIM\u2011Asset Management with a focus on retirement, will lead the session. The key areas we cover are: - The foundations of income - Why passive income matters, especially for women? - Case study of a personal story on how the speaker built and grew passive income - How to start looking for passive income? - How can your hobby make money and drive financial freedom? - How can your social network help you earn? - Starting small, the importance of consistency, and how to scale - How to achieve a happy and fulfilling retirement? - Worksheets to get you started on both topics Session goals: 1. Simplify money concepts 2. Bust common financial myths 3. Build your confidence in making financial decisions No jargon, just real talk. Note: Each session is theme-based. This session is about 'Creating and Building Passive Income and Saving for Retirement'\u2014we are not talking stocks and shares. What's included: Coffee and snacks. What's not: Parking\u2014you can park diagonally across in the Shobha Building.",

    "description": "This program introduces coding through interactive art, teaching p5.js and JavaScript to facilitate the generation of art based on the 'Ticket Tika Chaap' theme. The workshop is led by facilitator Tanvi Kumar from Paper Crane Lab. Participants are required to bring their own laptops for this hands-on session. It is a beginner-friendly workshop designed for those with little to no prior experience in coding, aiming to demystify the process and show the creative possibilities of technology. The session will guide attendees through the fundamentals of creative coding, starting with basic shapes and colors and progressing to more complex, interactive artworks. The goal is to empower participants to create their own unique digital art pieces inspired by the museum's collections. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a foundational understanding of JavaScript and the p5.js library, and will have created their own generative art project. This event provides a unique intersection of art and technology, encouraging a new way of thinking about creativity and digital tools in the modern world. The workshop is free to attend, though registration is required to secure a spot in this popular and innovative session.",

    "description": "The Goethe-Institut presents a special screening of 'All My Girls' ('Alle meine M\u00e4dchen'), a significant 1980 film from the German Democratic Republic (GDR) directed by the pioneering Iris Gusner. The film offers a fascinating look into the lives of women in East Germany, centering on Ralf, a film student who decides to document the lives of a team of six women working at the NARVA light bulb factory. As he delves into their world, the film explores their ambitions, friendships, and the challenges they face both in the workplace and in their personal lives. 'All My Girls' stands out for its authentic portrayal of female labor and camaraderie within the socialist state, moving beyond simple propaganda to offer a nuanced and humanistic perspective. Running for 86 minutes, this color film will be presented in its original German with English subtitles, providing a rare opportunity for audiences to experience a key work of East German cinema. The screening is part of a curated series that highlights important and often overlooked films from the DEFA studio era. Entry to this event is free, inviting film lovers and those interested in social history to discover the unique cinematic voice of Iris Gusner and gain insight into a bygone era.",
