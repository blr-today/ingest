    "description": "LADIES! \nWe have something new planned for you! \nCome try a new and easy to learn sport with us! \nPickleball is one of the fastest growing sports in the world and we are here to help you learn! \n \nThese sessions are 'Play-Only' sessions. No coaching involved. Pickleball is a very easy sport to pick-up and play, there\u2019s hardly a need for coaching beyond the basics. However, there will be experts at the facility that can guide you, if you require. \n \nThere are 2 courts booked for this session, and it's 4 people active at one court at a time.\u00a0 \n \nThese sessions are only One-Hour long, so we recommend arriving 15minutes early to finish up your warm-up and to maximise the one-hour. \n \nSome points to note: \n* Paddle & ball (equipment) will be available at the venue and is included in the cost of the workshop and sessions \n* Wear training/sports shoes, not running shoes. Running shoes have a taller sole profile, built for uni-directional movement only, while the sole profile of training/sports shoes are closer to the ground and are built for multi-directional movement \n* The venue has a cute F&B counter, in case you'd like some refreshments \n* \u2060The venue has clean washrooms for women, equipped with a shower, hair dryer etc \n* \u2060Parking is available at the venue \n \nEnjoy this new sport Sister! \n \nAny issues, please contact:\u00a0 \nTanvie: 8800199418",
