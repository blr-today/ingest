    "description": "Ladies! You asked and we've made it happen! Introducing this beginner-friendly trek to one of the most beautiful locations, just a 1\u00a0hour\u00a0drive away from the city. Join us for a surreal hike experience! \nThis hike will be led by certified mountaineers from the Monks on Wheels community - thus ensuring safety and security throughout the experience. \nLocation: Near Chikkaballapur, Karnataka. \nAltitude: Approximately 2710 feet (826 meters) above sea level. \nDifficulty Level: Easy, suitable for first time trekkers. \nTrek Duration: Usually takes about 2 hours to complete the round trip. \n--- \nTrek Route \nRoute: The trek begins from the base of Gudibande village and ascends through rocky paths and small hills. The trail is not very well-marked, so some route finding is required. The climb is gradual with a few steep sections as you approach the fort. \nGudibande Fort: The trek culminates at the Gudibande Fort, which is perched atop a hill and offers panoramic views of the surrounding plains, hills, and the nearby Nandi Hills range. \n--- \nKey Highlights \n\u2022\u2060 \u00a0\u2060Historical Significance: The fort, built by Byre Gowda of the Tuluva Dynasty in the 17th century, has a rich history and was used by local rulers for defense. The fort has seven levels with interconnecting escape routes which would help soldiers to flee in case of emergency. On the top of the fort is a Shiva temple known as \"Sir Rameshwara Temple\", established by Sage Vishwamitra and Lord Rama which is believed to be one of the 108 Jyotirlingas. \n\u2022\u2060 \u00a0\u2060Scenic Views: From the top, you get an excellent view of the surrounding landscape, including the rocky hills and vast plains. The fort\u2019s architecture and the remains of watchtowers are also a significant highlight. \n--- \nThings to carry: \n \n Umbrellas or caps (optional) \n Carry bags \n Water bottle \n Odomos \n Medicines (if any) \n Mobile Charger \n First Aid Kit \n Extra pair of clothing \n Sufficient amount of cash \n Portable chargers \n Tissues \n Masks \n Sanitizers \n Sunscreen \n \nAttire: \n \n Trek shoes (any footwear with good grip will do) \n Full pants (track pants or leggings) \n A dri-fit tshirt\u00a0 \n \nInclusions: \n \n Breakfast (Veg) \n Snacks\u00a0 \n Trek to Gudibande Fort \n Transport to and from Bangalore Club \n First Aid kit in case of emergencies \n 2 or more certified guides\u00a0from Monks on Wheels to manage and keep you entertained throughout the event \n \n--- \nThis hike is for community members and their friends, so feel free to book spots for some Misters you know too! \nReach out to Saachi (9513334690)\u00a0for more details.",
