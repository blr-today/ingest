    "description": "FOOTY WITH THE SISTERS \nWe're coming to your locality at HSR !! Bring out those football boots or shoes and remember to clean 'em nice! We're getting on the field to play the Beautiful game! \nThese sessions are open to all women! The football drills will be designed to both have fun and at the same time, learn and build on your basics of the sport! \nEach session is 90mins long, and will consist of a warm-up, football drills which are fun and athletic, a small game and a cool down at the end. It is a super fun start to your day and apart from that, even helps you get in your cardio for the day! \nWhat to wear? Comfortable workout clothes, incase you don't have access to football studs/turf shoes, training shoes would be sufficient. \nWhat to bring? A bottle of water, a towel to wipe off sweat (if required) and loads of enthusiasm to play :) \nDon't miss this!! See you on the field Sisters!! \n \nAishwarya\u00a0 \n9738012622 \nahana@sistersinsweat.in",
