No coaching involved. Pickleball is a very easy sport to pick-up and play, there\u2019s hardly a need for coaching beyond the basics. However, there will be experts at the facility that can guide you, if you require. \n \nThere are 2 courts booked for this session, and it's 4 people active at one court at a time.\u00a0 \n \nThese sessions are only One-Hour long, so we recommend arriving 15minutes early to finish up your warm-up and to maximise the one-hour. \n \nSome points to note: \n* Paddle & ball (equipment) will be available at the venue and is included in the cost of the workshop and sessions \n* Wear training/sports shoes, not running shoes. Running shoes have a taller sole profile, built for uni-directional movement only, while the sole profile of training/sports shoes are closer to the ground and are built for multi-directional movement \n* The venue has a cute F&B counter, in case you'd like some refreshments \n* \u2060The venue has clean washrooms for women, equipped with a shower, hair dryer etc \n* \u2060Parking is available at the venue \n \nEnjoy this new sport Sister! \n \nAny issues, please contact:\u00a0 \nTanvie: 8800199418",

We're getting on the field to play the Beautiful game! \nThese sessions are open to all women! The football drills will be designed to both have fun and at the same time, learn and build on your basics of the sport! \nEach session is 90mins long, and will consist of a warm-up, football drills which are fun and athletic, a small game and a cool down at the end. It is a super fun start to your day and apart from that, even helps you get in your cardio for the day! \nWhat to wear? Comfortable workout clothes, incase you don't have access to football studs/turf shoes, training shoes would be sufficient. \nWhat to bring? A bottle of water, a towel to wipe off sweat (if required) and loads of enthusiasm to play :) \nDon't miss this!! See you on the field Sisters!! \n \nAishwarya\u00a0 \n9738012622 \nahana@sistersinsweat.in",
