No coaching involved. Pickleball is a very easy sport to pick-up and play, there\u2019s hardly a need for coaching beyond the basics. However, there will be experts at the facility that can guide you, if you require. \n \nThere are 2 courts booked for this session, and it's 4 people active at one court at a time.\u00a0 \n \nThese sessions are only One-Hour long, so we recommend arriving 15minutes early to finish up your warm-up and to maximise the one-hour. \n \nSome points to note: \n* Paddle & ball (equipment) will be available at the venue and is included in the cost of the workshop and sessions \n* Wear training/sports shoes, not running shoes. Running shoes have a taller sole profile, built for uni-directional movement only, while the sole profile of training/sports shoes are closer to the ground and are built for multi-directional movement \n* The venue has a cute F&B counter, in case you'd like some refreshments \n* \u2060The venue has clean washrooms for women, equipped with a shower, hair dryer etc \n* \u2060Parking is available at the venue \n \nEnjoy this new sport Sister! \n \nAny issues, please contact:\u00a0 \nTanvie: 8800199418",
