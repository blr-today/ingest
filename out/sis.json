    "description": "FOOTY WITH THE SISTERS - INTERMEDIATE SESSIONS \nBring out those football boots or shoes and remember to clean 'em nice! We're getting on the field to play the Beautiful game! \nThis will be full 90mins session consisting of a warmup, technical ball drills, gametime and cool down. Since this is an intermediate level session, it is necessary that you have a bit of prior experience playing Football. Not recommended for complete beginners. \nWhat to wear? Comfortable workout clothes, incase you don't have access to football studs/turf shoes, training shoes would be sufficient. \nWhat to bring? A bottle of water, a towel to wipe off sweat (if required) and loads of enthusiasm to play :) \nSee you on the field Sisters!! \n \nContact: Samara \n9902082782 \nVibha\u00a0 \n8073681373",
